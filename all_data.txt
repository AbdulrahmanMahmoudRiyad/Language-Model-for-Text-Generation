A Shropshire Lad
A SHROPSHIRE LAD

          From Clee to heaven the beacon burns,
           The shires have seen it plain,
          From north and south the sign returns
           And beacons burn again.

          Look left, look right, the hills are bright,
           The dales are light between,
          Because 'tis fifty years to-night
           That God has saved the Queen.

          Now, when the flame they watch not towers
           About the soil they trod,
          Lads, we'll remember friends of ours
           Who shared the work with God.

          To skies that knit their heartstrings right,
           To fields that bred them brave,
          The saviours come not home to-night:
           Themselves they could not save.

          It dawns in Asia, tombstones show
           And Shropshire names are read;
          And the Nile spills his overflow
           Beside the Severn's dead.

          We pledge in peace by farm and town
           The Queen they served in war,
          And fire the beacons up and down
           The land they perished for.

          "God Save the Queen" we living sing,
           From height to height 'tis heard;
          And with the rest your voices ring,
           Lads of the Fifty-third.

          Oh, God will save her, fear you not:
           Be you the men you've been,
          Get you the sons your fathers got,
           And God will Save the Queen.


          Loveliest of trees, the cherry now
          Is hung with bloom along the bough,
          And stands about the woodland ride
          Wearing white for Eastertide.

          Now, of my threescore years and ten,
          Twenty will not come again,
          And take from seventy springs a score,
          It only leaves me fifty more.

          And since to look at things in bloom
          Fifty springs are little room,
          About the woodlands I will go
          To see the cherry hung with snow.


          THE RECRUIT

          Leave your home behind, lad,
           And reach your friends your hand,
          And go, and luck go with you
           While Ludlow tower shall stand.

          Oh, come you home of Sunday
           When Ludlow streets are still
          And Ludlow bells are calling
           To farm and lane and mill,

          Or come you home of Monday
           When Ludlow market hums
          And Ludlow chimes are playing
           "The conquering hero comes,"

          Come you home a hero,
           Or come not home at all,
          The lads you leave will mind you
           Till Ludlow tower shall fall.

          And you will list the bugle
           That blows in lands of morn,
          And make the foes of England
           Be sorry you were born.

          And you till trump of doomsday
           On lands of morn may lie,
          And make the hearts of comrades
           Be heavy where you die.

          Leave your home behind you,
           Your friends by field and town
          Oh, town and field will mind you
           Till Ludlow tower is down.


          REVEILLE

          Wake: the silver dusk returning
           Up the beach of darkness brims,
          And the ship of sunrise burning
           Strands upon the eastern rims.

          Wake: the vaulted shadow shatters,
           Trampled to the floor it spanned,
          And the tent of night in tatters
           Straws the sky-pavilioned land.

          Up, lad, up, 'tis late for lying:
           Hear the drums of morning play;
          Hark, the empty highways crying
           "Who'll beyond the hills away?"

          Towns and countries woo together,
           Forelands beacon, belfries call;
          Never lad that trod on leather
           Lived to feast his heart with all.

          Up, lad: thews that lie and cumber
           Sunlit pallets never thrive;
          Morns abed and daylight slumber
           Were not meant for man alive.

          Clay lies still, but blood's a rover;
           Breath's a ware that will not keep
          Up, lad: when the journey's over
           There'll be time enough to sleep.


          Oh see how thick the goldcup flowers
           Are lying in field and lane,
          With dandelions to tell the hours
           That never are told again.
          Oh may I squire you round the meads
           And pick you posies gay?
     -- 'Twill do no harm to take my arm.
           "You may, young man, you may."

          Ah, spring was sent for lass and lad,
           'Tis now the blood runs gold,
          And man and maid had best be glad
           Before the world is old.
          What flowers to-day may flower to-morrow,
           But never as good as new.
     -- Suppose I wound my arm right round -- 
           " 'Tis true, young man, 'tis true."

          Some lads there are, 'tis shame to say,
           That only court to thieve,
          And once they bear the bloom away
           'Tis little enough they leave.
          Then keep your heart for men like me
           And safe from trustless chaps.
          My love is true and all for you.
           "Perhaps, young man, perhaps."

          Oh, look in my eyes, then, can you doubt?
      -- Why, 'tis a mile from town.
          How green the grass is all about!
           We might as well sit down.
     -- Ah, life, what is it but a flower?
           Why must true lovers sigh?
          Be kind, have pity, my own, my pretty, -- 
           "Good-bye, young man, good-bye."


          When the lad for longing sighs,
           Mute and dull of cheer and pale,
          If at death's own door he lies,
           Maiden, you can heal his ail.

          Lovers' ills are all to buy:
           The wan look, the hollow tone,
          The hung head, the sunken eye,
           You can have them for your own.

          Buy them, buy them: eve and morn
           Lovers' ills are all to sell.
          Then you can lie down forlorn;
           But the lover will be well.


          When smoke stood up from Ludlow,
           And mist blew off from Teme,
          And blithe afield to ploughing
           Against the morning beam
           I strode beside my team,

          The blackbird in the coppice
           Looked out to see me stride,
          And hearkened as I whistled
           The tramping team beside,
           And fluted and replied:

          "Lie down, lie down, young yeoman;
           What use to rise and rise?
          Rise man a thousand mornings
           Yet down at last he lies,
           And then the man is wise."

          I heard the tune he sang me,
           And spied his yellow bill;
          I picked a stone and aimed it
           And threw it with a will:
           Then the bird was still.

          Then my soul within me
           Took up the blackbird's strain,
          And still beside the horses
           Along the dewy lane
           It Sang the song again:

          "Lie down, lie down, young yeoman;
           The sun moves always west;
          The road one treads to labour
           Will lead one home to rest,
           And that will be the best."


          "Farewell to barn and stack and tree,
           Farewell to Severn shore.
          Terence, look your last at me,
           For I come home no more.

          "The sun burns on the half-mown hill,
           By now the blood is dried;
          And Maurice amongst the hay lies still
           And my knife is in his side."

          "My mother thinks us long away;
           'Tis time the field were mown.
          She had two sons at rising day,
           To-night she'll be alone."

          "And here's a bloody hand to shake,
           And oh, man, here's good-bye;
          We'll sweat no more on scythe and rake,
           My bloody hands and I."

          "I wish you strength to bring you pride,
           And a love to keep you clean,
          And I wish you luck, come Lammastide,
           At racing on the green."

          "Long for me the rick will wait,
           And long will wait the fold,
          And long will stand the empty plate,
           And dinner will be cold."


          On moonlit heath and lonesome bank
           The sheep beside me graze;
          And yon the gallows used to clank
           Fast by the four cross ways.

          A careless shepherd once would keep
           The flocks by moonlight there,
          And high amongst the glimmering sheep
           The dead man stood on air.

          They hang us now in Shrewsbury jail:
           The whistles blow forlorn,
          And trains all night groan on the rail
           To men that die at morn.

          There sleeps in Shrewsbury jail to-night,
           Or wakes, as may betide,
          A better lad, if things went right,
           Than most that sleep outside.

          And naked to the hangman's noose
           The morning clocks will ring
          A neck God made for other use
           Than strangling in a string.

          And sharp the link of life will snap,
           And dead on air will stand
          Heels that held up as straight a chap
           As treads upon the land.

          So here I'll watch the night and wait
           To see the morning shine,
          When he will hear the stroke of eight
           And not the stroke of nine;

          And wish my friend as sound a sleep
           As lads' I did not know,
          That shepherded the moonlit sheep
           A hundred years ago.


          MARCH

          The sun at noon to higher air,
          Unharnessing the silver Pair
          That late before his chariot swam,
          Rides on the gold wool of the Ram.

          So braver notes the storm-cock sings
          To start the rusted wheel of things,
          And brutes in field and brutes in pen
          Leap that the world goes round again.

          The boys are up the woods with day
          To fetch the daffodils away,
          And home at noonday from the hills
          They bring no dearth of daffodils.

          Afield for palms the girls repair,
          And sure enough the palms are there,
          And each will find by hedge or pond
          Her waving silver-tufted wand.

          In farm and field through all the shire
          The eye beholds the heart's desire;
          Ah, let not only mine be vain,
          For lovers should be loved again.


          On your midnight pallet lying
           Listen, and undo the door:
          Lads that waste the light in sighing
           In the dark should sigh no more;
          Night should ease a lover's sorrow;
          Therefore, since I go to-morrow;
           Pity me before.

          In the land to which I travel,
           The far dwelling, let me say -- 
          Once, if here the couch is gravel,
           In a kinder bed I lay,
          And the breast the darnel smothers
          Rested once upon another's
           When it was not clay.


          When I watch the living meet,
           And the moving pageant file
          Warm and breathing through the street
           Where I lodge a little while,

          If the heats of hate and lust
           In the house of flesh are strong,
          Let me mind the house of dust
           Where my sojourn shall be long.

          In the nation that is not
           Nothing stands that stood before;
          There revenges are forgot,
           And the hater hates no more;

          Lovers lying two and two
           Ask not whom they sleep beside,
          And the bridegroom all night through
           Never turns him to the bride.


          When I was one-and-twenty
           I heard a wise man say,
          "Give crowns and pounds and guineas
           But not your heart away;
          Give pearls away and rubies
           But keep your fancy free."
          But I was one-and-twenty,
           No use to talk to me.

          When I was one-and-twenty
           I heard him say again,
          "The heart out of the bosom
           Was never given in vain;
          'Tis paid with sighs a plenty
           And sold for endless rue."
          And I am two-and-twenty,
           And oh, 'tis true, 'tis true.


          There pass the careless people
           That call their souls their own:
          Here by the road I loiter,
           How idle and alone.

          Ah, past the plunge of plummet,
           In seas I cannot sound,
          My heart and soul and senses,
           World without end, are drowned.

          His folly has not fellow
           Beneath the blue of day
          That gives to man or woman
           His heart and soul away.

          There flowers no balm to sain him
           From east of earth to west
          That's lost for everlasting
           The heart out of his breast.

          Here by the labouring highway
           With empty hands I stroll:
          Sea-deep, till doomsday morning,
           Lie lost my heart and soul.


          Look not in my eyes, for fear
           They mirror true the sight I see,
          And there you find your face too clear
           And love it and be lost like me.
          One the long nights through must lie
           Spent in star-defeated sighs,
          But why should you as well as I
           Perish? gaze not in my eyes.

          A Grecian lad, as I hear tell,
           One that many loved in vain,
          Looked into a forest well
           And never looked away again.
          There, when the turf in springtime flowers,
           With downward eye and gazes sad,
          Stands amid the glancing showers
           A jonquil, not a Grecian lad.


          It nods and curtseys and recovers
           When the wind blows above,
          The nettle on the graves of lovers
           That hanged themselves for love.

          The nettle nods, the wind blows over,
           The man, he does not move,
          The lover of the grave, the lover
           That hanged himself for love.


          Twice a week the winter thorough
           Here stood I to keep the goal:
          Football then was fighting sorrow
           For the young man's soul.

          Now in May time to the wicket
           Out I march with bat and pad:
          See the son of grief at cricket
           Trying to be glad.

          Try I will; no harm in trying:
           Wonder 'tis how little mirth
          Keeps the bones of man from lying
           On the bed of earth.


          Oh, when I was in love with you,
           Then I was clean and brave,
          And miles around the wonder grew
           How well did I behave.

          And now the fancy passes by,
           And nothing will remain,
          And miles around they'll say that I
           Am quite myself again.


          TO AN ATHLETE DYING YOUNG

          The time you won your town the race
          We chaired you through the market-place;
          Man and boy stood cheering by,
          And home we brought you shoulder-high.

          To-day, the road all runners come,
          Shoulder-high we bring you home,
          And set you at your threshold down,
          Townsman of a stiller town.

          Smart lad, to slip betimes away
          From fields where glory does not stay
          And early though the laurel grows
          It withers quicker than the rose.

          Eyes the shady night has shut
          Cannot see the record cut,
          And silence sounds no worse than cheers
          After earth has stopped the ears:

          Now you will not swell the rout
          Of lads that wore their honours out,
          Runners whom renown outran
          And the name died before the man.

          So set, before its echoes fade,
          The fleet foot on the sill of shade,
          And hold to the low lintel up
          The still-defended challenge-cup.

          And round that early-laurelled head
          Will flock to gaze the strengthless dead,
          And find unwithered on its curls
          The garland briefer than a girl's.


          Oh fair enough are sky and plain,
           But I know fairer far:
          Those are as beautiful again
           That in the water are;

          The pools and rivers wash so clean
           The trees and clouds and air,
          The like on earth was never seen,
           And oh that I were there.

          These are the thoughts I often think
           As I stand gazing down
          In act upon the cressy brink
           To strip and dive and drown;

          But in the golden-sanded brooks
           And azure meres I spy
          A silly lad that longs and looks
           And wishes he were I.


          BREDON HILL

          In summertime on Bredon
           The bells they sound so clear;
          Round both the shires they ring them
           In steeples far and near,
           A happy noise to hear.

          Here of a Sunday morning
           My love and I would lie
          And see the coloured counties,
           And hear the larks so high
           About us in the sky.

          The bells would ring to call her
           In valleys miles away:
          "Come all to church, good people;
           Good people, come and pray."
           But here my love would stay.

          And I would turn and answer
           Among the springing thyme,
          "Oh, peal upon our wedding,
           And we will hear the chime,
           And come to church in time."

          But when the snows at Christmas
           On Bredon top were strown,
          My love rose up so early
           And stole out unbeknown
           And went to church alone.

          They tolled the one bell only,
           Groom there was none to see,
          The mourners followed after,
           And so to church went she,
           And would not wait for me.

          The bells they sound on Bredon,
           And still the steeples hum.
          "Come all to church, good people," -- 
           Oh, noisy bells, be dumb;
           I hear you, I will come.


          The street sounds to the soldiers' tread,
           And out we troop to see:
          A single redcoat turns his head,
           He turns and looks at me.

          My man, from sky to sky's so far,
           We never crossed before;
          Such leagues apart the world's ends are,
           We're like to meet no more;

          What thoughts at heart have you and I
           We cannot stop to tell;
          But dead or living, drunk or dry,
           Soldier, I wish you well.


          The lads in their hundreds to Ludlow come in for the fair,
           There's men from the barn and the forge and the mill and the fold,
          The lads for the girls and the lads for the liquor are there,
           And there with the rest are the lads that will never be old.

          There's chaps from the town and the field and the till and the cart,
           And many to count are the stalwart, and many the brave,
          And many the handsome of face and the handsome of heart,
           And few that will carry their looks or their truth to the grave.

          I wish one could know them, I wish there were tokens to tell
           The fortunate fellows that now you can never discern;
          And then one could talk with them friendly and wish them farewell
           And watch them depart on the way that they will not return.

          But now you may stare as you like and there's nothing to scan;
           And brushing your elbow unguessed-at and not to be told
          They carry back bright to the coiner the mintage of man,
           The lads that will die in their glory and never be old.


          Say, lad, have you things to do?
           Quick then, while your day's at prime.
          Quick, and if 'tis work for two,
           Here am I, man: now's your time.

          Send me now, and I shall go;
           Call me, I shall hear you call;
          Use me ere they lay me low
           Where a man's no use at all;

          Ere the wholesome flesh decay,
           And the willing nerve be numb,
          And the lips lack breath to say,
           "No, my lad, I cannot come."


          This time of year a twelvemonth past,
           When Fred and I would meet,
          We needs must jangle, till at last
           We fought and I was beat.

          So then the summer fields about,
           Till rainy days began,
          Rose Harland on her Sundays out
           Walked with the better man.

          The better man she walks with still,
           Though now 'tis not with Fred:
          A lad that lives and has his will
           Is worth a dozen dead.

          Fred keeps the house all kinds of weather,
           And clay's the house he keeps;
          When Rose and I walk out together
           Stock-still lies Fred and sleeps.


           Along the fields as we came by
          A year ago, my love and I,
          The aspen over stile and stone
          Was talking to itself alone.
          "Oh who are these that kiss and pass?
          A country lover and his lass;
          Two lovers looking to be wed;
          And time shall put them both to bed,
          But she shall lie with earth above,
          And he beside another love."

           And sure enough beneath the tree
          There walks another love with me,
          And overhead the aspen heaves
          Its rainy-sounding silver leaves;
          And I spell nothing in their stir,
          But now perhaps they speak to her,
          And plain for her to understand
          They talk about a time at hand
          When I shall sleep with clover clad,
          And she beside another lad.


          "Is my team ploughing,
           That I was used to drive
          And hear the harness jingle
           When I was man alive?"

          Ay, the horses trample,
           The harness jingles now;
          No change though you lie under
           The land you used to plough.

          "Is football playing
           Along the river shore,
          With lads to chase the leather,
           Now I stand up no more?"

          Ay, the ball is flying,
           The lads play heart and soul;
          The goal stands up, the keeper
           Stands up to keep the goal.

          "Is my girl happy,
           That I thought hard to leave,
          And has she tired of weeping
           As she lies down at eve?"

          Ay, she lies down lightly,
           She lies not down to weep:
          Your girl is well contented.
           Be still, my lad, and sleep.

          "Is my friend hearty,
           Now I am thin and pine,
          And has he found to sleep in
           A better bed than mine?"

          Yes, lad, I lie easy,
           I lie as lads would choose;
          I cheer a dead man's sweetheart,
           Never ask me whose.


          THE WELSH MARCHES

          High the vanes of Shrewsbury gleam
          Islanded in Severn stream;
          The bridges from the steepled crest
          Cross the water east and west.

          The flag of morn in conqueror's state
          Enters at the English gate:
          The vanquished eve, as night prevails,
          Bleeds upon the road to Wales.

          Ages since the vanquished bled
          Round my mother's marriage-bed;
          There the ravens feasted far
          About the open house of war:

          When Severn down to Buildwas ran
          Coloured with the death of man,
          Couched upon her brother's grave
          The Saxon got me on the slave.

          The sound of fight is silent long
          That began the ancient wrong;
          Long the voice of tears is still
          That wept of old the endless ill.

          In my heart it has not died,
          The war that sleeps on Severn side;
          They cease not fighting, east and west,
          On the marches of my breast.

          Here the truceless armies yet
          Trample, rolled in blood and sweat;
          They kill and kill and never die;
          And I think that each is I.

          None will part us, none undo
          The knot that makes one flesh of two,
          Sick with hatred, sick with pain,
          Strangling-When shall we be slain?

          When shall I be dead and rid
          Of the wrong my father did?
          How long, how long, till spade and hearse
          Put to sleep my mother's curse?


          THE LENT LILY

          'Tis spring; come out to ramble
           The hilly brakes around,
          For under thorn and bramble
           About the hollow ground
           The primroses are found.

          And there's the windflower chilly
           With all the winds at play,
          And there's the Lenten lily
           That has not long to stay
           And dies on Easter day.

          And since till girls go maying
           You find the primrose still,
          And find the windflower playing
           With every wind at will,
           But not the daffodil,

          Bring baskets now, and sally
           Upon the spring's array,
          And bear from hill and valley
           The daffodil away
           That dies on Easter day.


          Others, I am not the first,
          Have willed more mischief than they durst:
          If in the breathless night I too
          Shiver now, 'tis nothing new.

          More than I, if truth were told,
          Have stood and sweated hot and cold,
          And through their reins in ice and fire
          Fear contended with desire.

          Agued once like me were they,
          But I like them shall win my way
          Lastly to the bed of mould
          Where there's neither heat nor cold.

          But from my grave across my brow
          Plays no wind of healing now,
          And fire and ice within me fight
          Beneath the suffocating night.


          On Wenlock Edge the wood's in trouble;
           His forest fleece the Wrekin heaves;
          The gale, it plies the saplings double,
           And thick on Severn snow the leaves.

          'Twould blow like this through holt and hanger
           When Uricon the city stood:
          'Tis the old wind in the old anger,
           But then it threshed another wood.

          Then, 'twas before my time, the Roman
           At yonder heaving hill would stare:
          The blood that warms an English yeoman,
           The thoughts that hurt him, they were there.

          There, like the wind through woods in riot,
           Through him the gale of life blew high;
          The tree of man was never quiet:
           Then 'twas the Roman, now 'tis I.

          The gale, it plies the saplings double,
           It blows so hard, 'twill soon be gone:
          To-day the Roman and his trouble
           Are ashes under Uricon.


          From far, from eve and morning
           And yon twelve-winded sky,
          The stuff of life to knit me
           Blew hither: here am I.

          Now- for a breath I tarry
           Nor yet disperse apart -- 
          Take my hand quick and tell me,
           What have you in your heart.

          Speak now, and I will answer;
           How shall I help you, say;
          Ere to the wind's twelve quarters
           I take my endless way.


          If truth in hearts that perish
           Could move the powers on high,
          I think the love I bear you
           Should make you not to die.

          Sure, sure, if stedfast meaning,
           If single thought could save,
          The world might end to-morrow,
           You should not see the grave.

          This long and sure-set liking,
           This boundless will to please,
     -- Oh, you should live for ever
           If there were help in these.

          But now, since all is idle,
           To this lost heart be kind,
          Ere to a town you journey
           Where friends are ill to find.
         
          THE NEW MISTRESS

           "Oh, sick I am to see you, will you never let me be?
          You may be good for something, but you are not good for me.
          Oh, go where you are wanted, for you are not wanted here." 
          And that was all the farewell when I parted from my dear.

          "I will go where I am wanted, to a lady born and bred
          Who will dress me free for nothing in a uniform of red;
          She will not be sick to see me if I only keep it clean:
          I will go where I am wanted for a soldier of the Queen."

          "I will go where I am wanted, for the sergeant does not mind;
          He may be sick to see me but he treats me very kind:
          He gives me beer and breakfast and a ribbon for my cap,
          And I never knew a sweetheart spend her money on a chap."

          "I will go where I am wanted, where there's room for one or two,
          And the men are none too many for the work there is to do;
          Where the standing line wears thinner and the dropping dead lie thick;
          And the enemies of England they shall see me and be sick."


          On the idle hill of summer,
           Sleepy with the flow of streams,
          Far I hear the steady drummer
           Drumming like a noise in dreams.

          Far and near and low and louder
           On the roads of earth go by,
          Dear to friends and food for powder,
           Soldiers marching, all to die.

          East and west on fields forgotten
           Bleach the bones of comrades slain,
          Lovely lads and dead and rotten;
           None that go return again.

          Far the calling bugles hollo,
           High the screaming fife replies,
          Gay the files of scarlet follow:
           Woman bore me, I will rise.


          White in the moon the long road lies,
           The moon stands blank above;
          White in the moon the long road lies
           That leads me from my love.

          Still hangs the hedge without a gust,
           Still, still the shadows stay:
          My feet upon the moonlit dust
           Pursue the ceaseless way.

          The world is round, so travellers tell,
           And straight though reach the track,
          Trudge on, trudge on, 'twill all be well,
           The way will guide one back.

          But ere the circle homeward hies
           Far, far must it remove:
          White in the moon the long road lies
           That leads me from my love.


           As through the wild green hills of Wyre
          The train ran, changing sky and shire,
          And far behind, a fading crest,
          Low in the forsaken west
          Sank the high-reared head of Clee,
          My hand lay empty on my knee.
          Aching on my knee it lay:
          That morning half a shire away
          So many an honest fellow's fist
          Had well-nigh wrung it from the wrist.
          Hand, said I, since now we part
          From fields and men we know by heart,
          From strangers' faces, strangers' lands, -- 
          Hand, you have held true fellows' hands.
          Be clean then; rot before you do
          A thing they'd not believe of you.
          You and I must keep from shame
          In London streets the Shropshire name;
          On banks of Thames they must not say
          Severn breeds worse men than they;
          And friends abroad must bear in mind
          Friends at home they leave behind.
          Oh, I shall be stiff and cold
          When I forget you, hearts of gold;
          The land where I shall mind you not
          Is the land where all's forgot.
          And if my foot returns no more
          To Teme nor Corve nor Severn shore,
          Luck, my lads, be with you still
          By falling stream and standing hill,
          By chiming tower and whispering tree,
          Men that made a man of me.
          About your work in town and farm
          Still you'll keep my head from harm,
          Still you'll help me, hands that gave
          A grasp to friend me to the grave.


          The winds out of the west land blow,
           My friends have breathed them there;
          Warm with the blood of lads I know
           Comes east the sighing air.

          It fanned their temples, filled their lungs,
           Scattered their forelocks free;
          My friends made words of it with tongues
           That talk no more to me.

          Their voices, dying as they fly,
           Thick on the wind are sown;
          The names of men blow soundless by,
           My fellows' and my own.

          Oh lads, at home I heard you plain,
           But here your speech is still,
          And down the sighing wind in vain
           You hollo from the hill.

          The wind and I, we both were there,
           But neither long abode;
          Now through the friendless world we fare
           And sigh upon the road.


          'Tis time, I think by Wenlock town
           The golden broom should blow;
          The hawthorn sprinkled up and down
           Should charge the land with snow.

          Spring will not wait the loiterer's time
           Who keeps so long away;
          So others wear the broom and climb
           The hedgerows heaped with may.

          Oh tarnish late on Wenlock Edge,
           Gold that I never see;
          Lie long, high snowdrifts in the hedge
           That will not shower on me.


          Into my heart an air that kills
           From yon far country blows:
          What are those blue remembered hills,
           What spires, what farms are those?

          That is the land of lost content,
           I see it shining plain,
          The happy highways where I went
           And cannot come again.


           In my own shire, if I was sad
          Homely comforters I had:
          The earth, because my heart was sore,
          Sorrowed for the son she bore;
          And standing hills, long to remain,
          Shared their short-lived comrade's pain.
          And bound for the same bourn as I,
          On every road I wandered by,
          Trod beside me, close and dear,
          The beautiful and death-struck year:
          Whether in the woodland brown
          I heard the beechnut rustle down,
          And saw the purple crocus pale
          Flower about the autumn dale;
          Or littering far the fields of May
          Lady-smocks a-bleaching lay,
          And like a skylit water stood
          The bluebells in the azured wood.

           Yonder, lightening other loads,
          The seasons range the country roads,
          But here in London streets I ken
          No such helpmates, only men;
          And these are not in plight to bear,
          If they would, another's care.
          They have enough as 'tis: I see
          In many an eye that measures me
          The mortal sickness of a mind
          Too unhappy to be kind.
          Undone with misery, all they can
          Is to hate their fellow man;
          And till they drop they needs must still
          Look at you and wish you ill.


          THE MERRY GUIDE

          Once in the wind of morning
           I ranged the thymy wold;
          The world-wide air was azure
           And all the brooks ran gold.

          There through the dews beside me
           Behold a youth that trod,
          With feathered cap on forehead,
           And poised a golden rod.

          With mien to match the morning
           And gay delightful guise
          And friendly brows and laughter
           He looked me in the eyes.

          Oh whence, I asked, and whither?
           He smiled and would not say,
          And looked at me and beckoned
           And laughed and led the way.

          And with kind looks and laughter
           And nought to say beside
          We two went on together,
           I and my happy guide.

          Across the glittering pastures
           And empty upland still
          And solitude of shepherds
           High in the folded hill,

          By hanging woods and hamlets
           That gaze through orchards down
          On many a windmill turning
           And far-discovered town,

          With gay regards of promise
           And sure unslackened stride
          And smiles and nothing spoken
           Led on my merry guide.

          By blowing realms of woodland
           With sunstruck vanes afield
          And cloud-led shadows sailing
           About the windy weald,

          By valley-guarded granges
           And silver waters wide,
          Content at heart I followed
           With my delightful guide.

          And like the cloudy shadows
           Across the country blown
          We two face on for ever,
           But not we two alone.

          With the great gale we journey
           That breathes from gardens thinned,
          Borne in the drift of blossoms
           Whose petals throng the wind;

          Buoyed on the heaven-heard whisper
           Of dancing leaflets whirled
          From all the woods that autumn
           Bereaves in all the world.

          And midst the fluttering legion
           Of all that ever died
          I follow, and before us
           Goes the delightful guide,

          With lips that brim with laughter
           But never once respond,
          And feet that fly on feathers,
           And serpent-circled wand.


          THE IMMORTAL PART

          When I meet the morning beam,
          Or lay me down at night to dream,
          I hear my bones within me say,
          "Another night, another day."

          "When shall this slough of sense be cast,
          This dust of thoughts be laid at last,
          The man of flesh and soul be slain
          And the man of bone remain?"

          "This tongue that talks, these lungs that shout,
          These thews that hustle us about,
          This brain that fills the skull with schemes,
          And its humming hive of dreams,-"

          "These to-day are proud in power
          And lord it in their little hour:
          The immortal bones obey control
          Of dying flesh and dying soul."

          " 'Tis long till eve and morn are gone:
          Slow the endless night comes on,
          And late to fulness grows the birth
          That shall last as long as earth."

          "Wanderers eastward, wanderers west,
          Know you why you cannot rest?
          'Tis that every mother's son
          Travails with a skeleton."

          "Lie down in the bed of dust;
          Bear the fruit that bear you must;
          Bring the eternal seed to light,
          And morn is all the same as night."

          "Rest you so from trouble sore,
          Fear the heat o' the sun no more,
          Nor the snowing winter wild,
          Now you labour not with child."

          "Empty vessel, garment cast,
          We that wore you long shall last.
     -- Another night, another day."
          So my bones within me say.

          Therefore they shall do my will
          To-day while I am master still,
          And flesh and soul, now both are strong,
          Shall hale the sullen slaves along,

          Before this fire of sense decay,
          This smoke of thought blow clean away,
          And leave with ancient night alone
          The stedfast and enduring bone.


          Shot? so quick, so clean an ending?
           Oh that was right, lad, that was brave:
          Yours was not an ill for mending,
           'Twas best to take it to the grave.

          Oh you had forethought, you could reason,
           And saw your road and where it led,
          And early wise and brave in season
           Put the pistol to your head.

          Oh soon, and better so than later
           After long disgrace and scorn,
          You shot dead the household traitor,
           The soul that should not have been born.

          Right you guessed the rising morrow
           And scorned to tread the mire you must:
          Dust's your wages, son of sorrow,
           But men may come to worse than dust.

          Souls undone, undoing others, -- 
           Long time since the tale began.
          You would not live to wrong your brothers:
           Oh lad, you died as fits a man.

          Now to your grave shall friend and stranger
           With ruth and some with envy come:
          Undishonoured, clear of danger,
           Clean of guilt, pass hence and home.

          Turn safe to rest, no dreams, no waking;
           And here, man, here's the wreath I've made:
          'Tis not a gift that's worth the taking,
           But wear it and it will not fade.


          If it chance your eye offend you,
           Pluck it out, lad, and be sound:
          'Twill hurt, but here are salves to friend you,
           And many a balsam grows on ground.

          And if your hand or foot offend you,
           Cut it off, lad, and be whole;
          But play the man, stand up and end you,
           When your sickness is your soul.


           Bring, in this timeless grave to throw,
          No cypress, sombre on the snow;
          Snap not from the bitter yew
          His leaves that live December through;
          Break no rosemary, bright with rime
          And sparkling to the cruel clime;
          Nor plod the winter land to look
          For willows in the icy brook
          To cast them leafless round him: bring
          No spray that ever buds in spring.

           But if the Christmas field has kept
          Awns the last gleaner overstept,
          Or shrivelled flax, whose flower is blue
          A single season, never two;
          Or if one haulm whose year is o'er
          Shivers on the upland frore,
     -- Oh, bring from hill and stream and plain
          Whatever will not flower again,
          To give him comfort: he and those
          Shall bide eternal bedfellows
          Where low upon the couch he lies
          Whence he never shall arise.


          THE CARPENTER'S SON

          "Here the hangman stops his cart:
          Now the best of friends must part.
          Fare you well, for ill fare I:
          Live, lads, and I will die."

          "Oh, at home had I but stayed
          'Prenticed to my father's trade,
          Had I stuck to plane and adze,
          I had not been lost, my lads."

          "Then I might have built perhaps
          Gallows-trees for other chaps,
          Never dangled on my own,
          Had I but left ill alone."

          "Now, you see, they hang me high,
          And the people passing by
          Stop to shake their fists and curse;
          So 'tis come from ill to worse."

          "Here hang I, and right and left
          Two poor fellows hang for theft:
          All the same's the luck we prove,
          Though the midmost hangs for love."

          "Comrades all, that stand and gaze,
          Walk henceforth in other ways;
          See my neck and save your own:
          Comrades all, leave ill alone."

          "Make some day a decent end,
          Shrewder fellows than your friend.
          Fare you well, for ill fare I:
          Live, lads, and I will die."


          Be still, my soul, be still; the arms you bear are brittle,
           Earth and high heaven are fixt of old and founded strong.
          Think rather,-call to thought, if now you grieve a little,
           The days when we had rest, O soul, for they were long.

          Men loved unkindness then, but lightless in the quarry
           I slept and saw not; tears fell down, I did not mourn;
          Sweat ran and blood sprang out and I was never sorry:
           Then it was well with me, in days ere I was born.

          Now, and I muse for why and never find the reason,
           I pace the earth, and drink the air, and feel the sun.
          Be still, be still, my soul; it is but for a season:
           Let us endure an hour and see injustice done.

          Ay, look: high heaven and earth ail from the prime foundation;
           All thoughts to rive the heart are here, and all are vain:
          Horror and scorn and hate and fear and indignation -- 
           Oh why did I awake? when shall I sleep again?


          Think no more, lad; laugh, be jolly:
           Why should men make haste to die?
          Empty heads and tongues a-talking
          Make the rough road easy walking,
          And the feather pate of folly
           Bears the falling sky.

          Oh, 'tis jesting, dancing, drinking
           Spins the heavy world around.
          If young hearts were not so clever,
          Oh, they would be young for ever:
          Think no more; 'tis only thinking
           Lays lads underground.


           Clunton and Clunbury,
           Clungunford and Clun,
          Are the quietest places
           Under the sun. 

          In valleys of springs of rivers,
           By Ony and Teme and Clun,
          The country for easy livers,
           The quietest under the sun,

          We still had sorrows to lighten,
           One could not be always glad,
          And lads knew trouble at Knighton
           When I was a Knighton lad.

          By bridges that Thames runs under,
           In London, the town built ill,
          'Tis sure small matter for wonder
           If sorrow is with one still.

          And if as a lad grows older
           The troubles he bears are more,
          He carries his griefs on a shoulder
           That handselled them long before.

          Where shall one halt to deliver
           This luggage I'd lief set down?
          Not Thames, not Teme is the river,
           Nor London nor Knighton the town:

          'Tis a long way further than Knighton,
           A quieter place than Clun,
          Where doomsday may thunder and lighten
           And little 'twill matter to one.


           Loitering with a vacant eye
          Along the Grecian gallery,
          And brooding on my heavy ill,
          I met a statue standing still.
          Still in marble stone stood he,
          And stedfastly he looked at me.
          "Well met," I thought the look would say,
          "We both were fashioned far away;
          We neither knew, when we were young,
          These Londoners we live among."

           Still he stood and eyed me hard,
          An earnest and a grave regard:
          "What, lad, drooping with your lot?
          I too would be where I am not.
          I too survey that endless line
          Of men whose thoughts are not as mine.
          Years, ere you stood up from rest,
          On my neck the collar prest;
          Years, when you lay down your ill,
          I shall stand and bear it still.
          Courage, lad, 'tis not for long:
          Stand, quit you like stone, be strong."
          So I thought his look would say;
          And light on me my trouble lay,
          And I slept out in flesh and bone
          Manful like the man of stone.


          Far in a western brookland
           That bred me long ago
          The poplars stand and tremble
           By pools I used to know.

          There, in the windless night-time,
           The wanderer, marvelling why,
          Halts on the bridge to hearken
           How soft the poplars sigh.

          He hears: long since forgotten
           In fields where I was known,
          Here I lie down in London
           And turn to rest alone.

          There, by the starlit fences,
           The wanderer halts and hears
          My soul that lingers sighing
           About the glimmering weirs.


          THE TRUE LOVER

          The lad came to the door at night,
           When lovers crown their vows,
          And whistled soft and out of sight
           In shadow of the boughs.

          "I shall not vex you with my face
           Henceforth, my love, for aye;
          So take me in your arms a space
           Before the east is grey."

          "When I from hence away am past
           I shall not find a bride,
          And you shall be the first and last
           I ever lay beside."

          She heard and went and knew not why;
           Her heart to his she laid;
          Light was the air beneath the sky
           But dark under the shade.

          "Oh do you breathe, lad, that your breast
           Seems not to rise and fall,
          And here upon my bosom prest
           There beats no heart at all?"

          "Oh loud, my girl, it once would knock,
           You should have felt it then;
          But since for you I stopped the clock
           It never goes again."

          "Oh lad, what is it, lad, that drips
           Wet from your neck on mine?
          What is it falling on my lips,
           My lad, that tastes of brine?"

          "Oh like enough 'tis blood, my dear,
           For when the knife has slit
          The throat across from ear to ear
           'Twill bleed because of it."

          Under the stars the air was light
           But dark below the boughs,
          The still air of the speechless night,
           When lovers crown their vows.


          With rue my heart is laden
           For golden friends I had,
          For many a rose-lipt maiden
           And many a lightfoot lad.

          By brooks too broad for leaping
           The lightfoot boys are laid;
          The rose-lipt girls are sleeping
           In fields where roses fade.


          Westward on the high-hilled plains
           Where for me the world began,
          Still, I think, in newer veins
           Frets the changeless blood of man.

          Now that other lads than I
           Strip to bathe on Severn shore,
          They, no help, for all they try,
           Tread the mill I trod before.

          There, when hueless is the west
           And the darkness hushes wide,
          Where the lad lies down to rest
           Stands the troubled dream beside.

          There, on thoughts that once were mine,
           Day looks down the eastern steep,
          And the youth at morning shine
           Makes the vow he will not keep.


          THE DAY OF BATTLE

          "Far I hear the bugle blow
          To call me where I would not go,
          And the guns begin the song,
          `Soldier, fly or stay for long.`"

          "Comrade, if to turn and fly
          Made a soldier never die,
          Fly I would, for who would not?
          'Tis sure no pleasure to be shot."

          "But since the man that runs away
          Lives to die another day,
          And cowards' funerals, when they come
          Are not wept so well at home."

          "Therefore, though the best is bad,
          Stand and do the best my lad;
          Stand and fight and see your slain,
          And take the bullet in your brain."


          You smile upon your friend to-day,
           To-day his ills are over;
          You hearken to the lover's say,
           And happy is the lover.

          'Tis late to hearken, late to smile,
           But better late than never:
          I shall have lived a little while
           Before I die for ever.


          When I came last to Ludlow
           Amidst the moonlight pale,
          Two friends kept step beside me,
           Two honest lads and hale.

          Now Dick lies long in the churchyard,
           And Ned lies long in jail,
          And I come home to Ludlow
           Amidst the moonlight pale.


          THE ISLE OF PORTLAND

          The star-filled seas are smooth to-night
           From France to England strown;
          Black towers above the Portland light
           The felon-quarried stone.

          On yonder island, not to rise,
           Never to stir forth free,
          Far from his folk a dead lad lies
           That once was friends with me.

          Lie you easy, dream you light,
           And sleep you fast for aye;
          And luckier may you find the night
           Than ever you found the day.


          Now hollow fires burn out to black,
           And lights are guttering low:
          Square your shoulders, lift your pack,
           And leave your friends and go.

          Oh never fear, man, nought's to dread,
           Look not left nor right:
          In all the endless road you tread
           There's nothing but the night.


          HUGHLEY STEEPLE

          The vane on Hughley steeple
           Veers bright, a far-known sign,
          And there lie Hughley people,
           And there lie friends of mine.
          Tall in their midst the tower
           Divides the shade and sun,
          And the clock strikes the hour
           And tells the time to none.

          To south the headstones cluster,
           The sunny mounds lie thick;
          The dead are more in muster
           At Hughley than the quick.
          North, for a soon-told number,
           Chill graves the sexton delves,
          And steeple-shadowed slumber
           The slayers of themselves.

          To north, to south, lie parted,
           With Hughley tower above,
          The kind, the single-hearted,
           The lads I used to love.
          And, south or north, 'tis only
           A choice of friends one knows,
          And I shall ne'er be lonely
           Asleep with these or those.


           "Terence, this is stupid stuff:
          You eat your victuals fast enough;
          There can't be much amiss, 'tis clear,
          To see the rate you drink your beer.
          But oh, good Lord, the verse you make,
          It gives a chap the belly-ache.
          The cow, the old cow, she is dead;
          It sleeps well, the horned head:
          We poor lads, 'tis our turn now
          To hear such tunes as killed the cow.
          Pretty friendship 'tis to rhyme
          Your friends to death before their time
          Moping melancholy mad:
          Come, pipe a tune to dance to, lad."

           Why, if 'tis dancing you would be,
          There's brisker pipes than poetry.
          Say, for what were hop-yards meant,
          Or why was Burton built on Trent?
          Oh many a peer of England brews
          Livelier liquor than the Muse,
          And malt does more than Milton can
          To justify God's ways to man.
          Ale, man, ale's the stuff to drink
          For fellows whom it hurts to think:
          Look into the pewter pot
          To see the world as the world's not.
          And faith, 'tis pleasant till 'tis past:
          The mischief is that 'twill not last.
          Oh I have been to Ludlow fair
          And left my necktie God knows where,
          And carried half-way home, or near,
          Pints and quarts of Ludlow beer:
          Then the world seemed none so bad,
          And I myself a sterling lad;
          And down in lovely muck I've lain,
          Happy till I woke again.
          Then I saw the morning sky:
          Heigho, the tale was all a lie;
          The world, it was the old world yet,
          I was I, my things were wet,
          And nothing now remained to do
          But begin the game anew.

           Therefore, since the world has still
          Much good, but much less good than ill,
          And while the sun and moon endure
          Luck's a chance, but trouble's sure,
          I'd face it as a wise man would,
          And train for ill and not for good.
          'Tis true the stuff I bring for sale
          Is not so brisk a brew as ale:
          Out of a stem that scored the hand
          I wrung it in a weary land.
          But take it: if the smack is sour,
          The better for the embittered hour;
          It should do good to heart and head
          When your soul is in my soul's stead;
          And I will friend you, if I may,
          In the dark and cloudy day.

           There was a king reigned in the East:
          There, when kings will sit to feast,
          They get their fill before they think
          With poisoned meat and poisoned drink.
          He gathered all that springs to birth
          From the many-venomed earth;
          First a little, thence to more,
          He sampled all her killing store;
          And easy, smiling, seasoned sound,
          Sate the king when healths went round.
          They put arsenic in his meat
          And stared aghast to watch him eat;
          They poured strychnine in his cup
          And shook to see him drink it up:
          They shook, they stared as white's their shirt:
          Them it was their poison hurt.
     -- I tell the tale that I heard told.
          Mithridates, he died old.



          I Hoed and trenched and weeded,
           And took the flowers to fair:
          I brought them home unheeded;
           The hue was not the wear.

          So up and down I sow them
           For lads like me to find,
          When I shall lie below them,
           A dead man out of mind.

          Some seed the birds devour,
           And some the season mars,
          But here and there will flower
           The solitary stars,

          And fields will yearly bear them
           As light-leaved spring comes on,
          And luckless lads will wear them
           When I am dead and gone.

                               OTHER VERSES

THE TEMPORARY THE ALL


   CHANGE and chancefulness in my flowering youthtime,
   Set me sun by sun near to one unchosen;
   Wrought us fellow-like, and despite divergence,
      Friends interlinked us.

   "Cherish him can I while the true one forthcome -- 
   Come the rich fulfiller of my prevision;
   Life is roomy yet, and the odds unbounded."
      So self-communed I.

   Thwart my wistful way did a damsel saunter,
   Fair, the while unformed to be all-eclipsing;
   "Maiden meet," held I, "till arise my forefelt
      Wonder of women."

   Long a visioned hermitage deep desiring,
   Tenements uncouth I was fain to house in;
   "Let such lodging be for a breath-while," thought I,
      "Soon a more seemly.

   "Then, high handiwork will I make my life-deed,
   Truth and Light outshow; but the ripe time pending,
   Intermissive aim at the thing sufficeth."
      Thus I . . . But lo, me!

   Mistress, friend, place, aims to be bettered straightway,
   Bettered not has Fate or my hand's achieving;
   Sole the showance those of my onward earth-track -- 
      Never transcended!




AMABEL


   I MARKED her ruined hues,
   Her custom-straitened views,
   And asked, "Can there indwell
      My Amabel?"

   I looked upon her gown,
   Once rose, now earthen brown;
   The change was like the knell
      Of Amabel.

   Her step's mechanic ways
   Had lost the life of May's;
   Her laugh, once sweet in swell,
      Spoilt Amabel.

   I mused: "Who sings the strain
   I sang ere warmth did wane?
   Who thinks its numbers spell
      His Amabel?" -- 

   Knowing that, though Love cease,
   Love's race shows undecrease;
   All find in dorp or dell
      An Amabel.

   -- I felt that I could creep
   To some housetop, and weep,
   That Time the tyrant fell
      Ruled Amabel!

   I said (the while I sighed
   That love like ours had died),
   "Fond things I'll no more tell
      To Amabel,

   "But leave her to her fate,
   And fling across the gate,
   `Till the Last Trump, farewell,
      O Amabel!`"





HAP


   IF but some vengeful god would call to me
   From up the sky, and laugh: "Thou suffering thing,
   Know that thy sorrow is my ecstasy,
   That thy love's loss is my hate's profiting!"

   Then would I bear, and clench myself, and die,
   Steeled by the sense of ire unmerited;
   Half-eased in that a Powerfuller than I
   Had willed and meted me the tears I shed.

   But not so.  How arrives it joy lies slain,
   And why unblooms the best hope ever sown?
   -- Crass Casualty obstructs the sun and rain,
   And dicing Time for gladness casts a moan . . .
   These purblind Doomsters had as readily strown
   Blisses about my pilgrimage as pain.





"IN VISION I ROAMED"
TO -- 


   IN vision I roamed the flashing Firmament,
   So fierce in blazon that the Night waxed wan,
   As though with an awed sense of such ostent;
   And as I thought my spirit ranged on and on

   In footless traverse through ghast heights of sky,
   To the last chambers of the monstrous Dome,
   Where stars the brightest here to darkness die:
   Then, any spot on our own Earth seemed Home!

   And the sick grief that you were far away
   Grew pleasant thankfulness that you were near?
   Who might have been, set on some outstep sphere,
   Less than a Want to me, as day by day
   I lived unware, uncaring all that lay
   Locked in that Universe taciturn and drear.





AT A BRIDAL
TO -- 


   WHEN you paced forth, to wait maternity,
   A dream of other offspring held my mind,
   Compounded of us twain as Love designed;
   Rare forms, that corporate now will never be!

   Should I, too, wed as slave to Mode's decree,
   And each thus found apart, of false desire,
   A stolid line, whom no high aims will fire
   As had fired ours could ever have mingled we;

   And, grieved that lives so matched should mis-compose,
   Each mourn the double waste; and question dare
   To the Great Dame whence incarnation flows.
   Why those high-purposed children never were:
   What will she answer?  That she does not care
   If the race all such sovereign types unknows.





POSTPONEMENT


   SNOW-BOUND in woodland, a mournful word,
   Dropt now and then from the bill of a bird,
   Reached me on wind-wafts; and thus I heard,
      Wearily waiting: -- 

   "I planned her a nest in a leafless tree,
   But the passers eyed and twitted me,
   And said:`How reckless a bird is he,
      Cheerily mating!`

   "Fear-filled, I stayed me till summer-tide,
   In lewth of leaves to throne her bride;
   But alas! her love for me waned and died,
      Wearily waiting.

   "Ah, had I been like some I see,
   Born to an evergreen nesting-tree,
   None had eyed and twitted me,
      Cheerily mating!"





A CONFESSION TO A FRIEND IN TROUBLE


   YOUR troubles shrink not, though I feel them less
   Here, far away, than when I tarried near;
   I even smile old smiles -- with listlessness -- 
   Yet smiles they are, not ghastly mockeries mere.

   A thought too strange to house within my brain
   Haunting its outer precincts I discern:
   -- That I will not show zeal again to learn
   Your griefs, and sharing them, renew my pain . . .

   It goes, like murky bird or buccaneer
   That shapes its lawless figure on the main,
   And each new impulse tends to make outflee
   The unseemly instinct that had lodgment here;
   Yet, comrade old, can bitterer knowledge be
   Than that, though banned, such instinct was in me!





NEUTRAL TONES


   WE stood by a pond that winter day,
   And the sun was white, as though chidden of God,
   And a few leaves lay on the starving sod,
      -- They had fallen from an ash, and were gray.

   Your eyes on me were as eyes that rove
   Over tedious riddles solved years ago;
   And some words played between us to and fro -- 
      On which lost the more by our love.

   The smile on your mouth was the deadest thing
   Alive enough to have strength to die;
   And a grin of bitterness swept thereby
      Like an ominous bird a-wing . . .

   Since then, keen lessons that love deceives,
   And wrings with wrong, have shaped to me
   Your face, and the God-curst sun, and a tree,
      And a pond edged with grayish leaves.


SHE
AT HIS FUNERAL


   THEY bear him to his resting-place -- 
   In slow procession sweeping by;
   I follow at a stranger's space;
   His kindred they, his sweetheart I.
   Unchanged my gown of garish dye,
   Though sable-sad is their attire;
   But they stand round with griefless eye,
   Whilst my regret consumes like fire!




HER INITIALS


   UPON a poet's page I wrote
   Of old two letters of her name;
   Part seemed she of the effulgent thought
   Whence that high singer's rapture came.
   -- When now I turn the leaf the same
   Immortal light illumes the lay,
   But from the letters of her name
   The radiance has died away!





HER DILEMMA
(IN -- CHURCH)


   THE two were silent in a sunless church,
   Whose mildewed walls, uneven paving-stones,
   And wasted carvings passed antique research;
   And nothing broke the clock's dull monotones.

   Leaning against a wormy poppy-head,
   So wan and worn that he could scarcely stand,
   -- For he was soon to die, -- he softly said,
   "Tell me you love me!" -- holding hard her hand.

   She would have given a world to breathe "yes" truly,
   So much his life seemed handing on her mind,
   And hence she lied, her heart persuaded throughly
   'Twas worth her soul to be a moment kind.

   But the sad need thereof, his nearing death,
   So mocked humanity that she shamed to prize
   A world conditioned thus, or care for breath
   Where Nature such dilemmas could devise.




REVULSION


   THOUGH I waste watches framing words to fetter
   Some spirit to mine own in clasp and kiss,
   Out of the night there looms a sense 'twere better
   To fail obtaining whom one fails to miss.

   For winning love we win the risk of losing,
   And losing love is as one's life were riven;
   It cuts like contumely and keen ill-using
   To cede what was superfluously given.

   Let me then feel no more the fateful thrilling
   That devastates the love-worn wooer's frame,
   The hot ado of fevered hopes, the chilling
   That agonizes disappointed aim!
   So may I live no junctive law fulfilling,
   And my heart's table bear no woman's name.


   



SHE, TO HIM
I


   WHEN you shall see me in the toils of Time,
   My lauded beauties carried off from me,
   My eyes no longer stars as in their prime,
   My name forgot of Maiden Fair and Free;

   When in your being heart concedes to mind,
   And judgment, though you scarce its process know,
   Recalls the excellencies I once enshrined,
   And you are irked that they have withered so:

   Remembering that with me lies not the blame,
   That Sportsman Time but rears his brood to kill,
   Knowing me in my soul the very same -- 
   One who would die to spare you touch of ill! -- 
   Will you not grant to old affection's claim
   The hand of friendship down Life's sunless hill?





SHE, TO HIM
II


   PERHAPS, long hence, when I have passed away,
   Some other's feature, accent, thought like mine,
   Will carry you back to what I used to say,
   And bring some memory of your love's decline.

   Then you may pause awhile and think, "Poor jade!"
   And yield a sigh to me -- as ample due,
   Not as the tittle of a debt unpaid
   To one who could resign her all to you -- 

   And thus reflecting, you will never see
   That your thin thought, in two small words conveyed,
   Was no such fleeting phantom-thought to me,
   But the Whole Life wherein my part was played;
   And you amid its fitful masquerade
   A Thought -- as I in yours but seem to be.





SHE, TO HIM
III


   I WILL be faithful to thee; aye, I will!
   And Death shall choose me with a wondering eye
   That he did not discern and domicile
   One his by right ever since that last Good-bye!

   I have no care for friends, or kin, or prime
   Of manhood who deal gently with me here;
   Amid the happy people of my time
   Who work their love's fulfilment, I appear

   Numb as a vane that cankers on its point,
   True to the wind that kissed ere canker came;
   Despised by souls of Now, who would disjoint
   The mind from memory, and make Life all aim,

   My old dexterities of hue quite gone,
   And nothing left for Love to look upon.





SHE, TO HIM
IV


   This love puts all humanity from me;
   I can but maledict her, pray her dead,
   For giving love and getting love of thee -- 
   Feeding a heart that else mine own had fed!

   How much I love I know not, life not known,
   Save as some unit I would add love by;
   But this I know, my being is but thine own -- 
   Fused from its separateness by ecstasy.

   And thus I grasp thy amplitudes, of her
   Ungrasped, though helped by nigh-regarding eyes;
   Canst thou then hate me as an envier
   Who see unrecked what I so dearly prize?
   Believe me, Lost One, Love is lovelier
   The more it shapes its moan in selfish-wise.





DITTY

   BENEATH a knap where flown
      Nestlings play,
   Within walls of weathered stone,
      Far away
   From the files of formal houses,
   By the bough the firstling browses,
   Lives a Sweet: no merchants meet,
   No man barters, no man sells
      Where she dwells.

   Upon that fabric fair
      "Here is she!"
   Seems written everywhere
      Unto me.
   But to friends and nodding neighbours,
   Fellow-wights in lot and labours,
   Who descry the times as I,
   No such lucid legend tells
      Where she dwells.

   Should I lapse to what I was
      Ere we met;
   (Such can not be, but because
      Some forget
   Let me feign it) -- none would notice
   That where she I know by rote is
   Spread a strange and withering change,
   Like a drying of the wells
      Where she dwells.

   To feel I might have kissed -- 
      Loved as true -- 
   Otherwhere, nor Mine have missed
      My life through.
   Had I never wandered near her,
   Is a smart severe -- severer
   In the thought that she is nought,
   Even as I, beyond the dells
      Where she dwells.

   And Devotion droops her glance
      To recall
   What bond-servants of Chance
      We are all.
   I but found her in that, going
   On my errant path unknowing,
   I did not out-skirt the spot
   That no spot on earth excels,
      -- Where she dwells!


               



THE SERGEANT'S SONG

   And march his men on London town!
      Rollicum-rorum, tol-lol-lorum,

VALENCIENNES
               IN MEMORY OF S. C. (PENSIONER).  DIED
   WE trenched, we trumpeted and drummed,
   And from our mortars tons of iron hummed
      Ath'art the ditch, the month we bombed
         The Town o' Valencie n.

      'Twas in the June o' Ninety-dree
   (The Duke o' Yark our then Commander been)
      The German Legion, Guards, and we
         Laid siege to Valencie n.

      This was the first time in the war
   That French and English spilled each other's gore;
      -- Few dreamt how far would roll the roar
         Begun at Valencie n!

      'Twas said that we'd no business there
   A-topper n the French for disagre n;
      However, that's not my affair -- 
         We were at Valencie n.

      Such snocks and slats, since war began
   Never knew raw recruit or veteran:
      Stone-deaf therence went many a man
         Who served at Valencie n.

      Into the streets, ath'art the sky,
   A hundred thousand balls and bombs were fle n;
      And harmless townsfolk fell to die
         Each hour at Valencie n!

      And, sweat n wi' the bombardiers,
   A shell was slent to shards anighst my ears:
      -- 'Twas nigh the end of hopes and fears
         For me at Valencie n!

      They bore my wownded frame to camp,
   And shut my gap n skull, and washed en cle n,
      And jined en wi' a zilver clamp
         Thik night at Valencie n.

      "We've fetched en back to quick from dead;
   But never more on earth while rose is red
      Will drum rouse Corpel!" Doctor said
         O' me at Valencie n.

      'Twer true.  No voice o' friend or foe
   Can reach me now, or any liv n be n;
      And little have I power to know
         Since then at Valencie n!

      I never hear the zummer hums
   O' bees; and don' know when the cuckoo comes;
      But night and day I hear the bombs
         We threw at Valencie n . . .

      As for the Duke o' Yark in war,
   There be some volk whose judgment o' en is mean;
      But this I say -- a was not far
         From great at Valencie n.

      O' wild wet nights, when all seems sad,
   My wownds come back, as though new wownds I'd had;
      But yet -- at times I'm sort o' glad
         I fout at Valencie n.

      Well: Heaven wi' its jasper halls
   Is now the on'y Town I care to be in . . .
      Good Lord, if Nick should bomb the walls
         As we did Valencie n!






SAN SEBASTIAN


         WITH THOUGHTS OF SERGEANT M-- (PENSIONER), WHO DIED

   "WHY, Sergeant, stray on the Ivel Way,
   As though at home there were spectres rife?
   From first to last 'twas a proud career!
   And your sunny years with a gracious wife
      Have brought you a daughter dear.

   "I watched her to-day; a more comely maid,
   As she danced in her muslin bowed with blue,
   Round a Hintock maypole never gayed."
   -- "Aye, aye; I watched her this day, too,
      As it happens," the Sergeant said.

   "My daughter is now," he again began,
   "Of just such an age as one I knew
   When we of the Line and Forlorn-hope van,
   On an August morning -- a chosen few -- 
      Stormed San Sebastian.

   "She's a score less three; so about was she -- 
   The maiden I wronged in Peninsular days . . .
   You may prate of your prowess in lusty times,
   But as years gnaw inward you blink your bays,
      And see too well your crimes!

   "We'd stormed it at night, by the vlanker-light
   Of burning towers, and the mortar's boom:
   We'd topped the breach; but had failed to stay,
   For our files were misled by the baffling gloom;
      And we said we'd storm by day.

                     
   "So, out of the trenches, with features set,
   On that hot, still morning, in measured pace,
   Our column climbed; climbed higher yet,
   Past the fauss'bray, scarp, up the curtain-face,
      And along the parapet.

   "From the battened hornwork the cannoneers
   Hove crashing balls of iron fire;
   On the shaking gap mount the volunteers
   In files, and as they mount expire
      Amid curses, groans, and cheers.

   "Five hours did we storm, five hours re-form,
   As Death cooled those hot blood pricked on;
   Till our cause was helped by a woe within:
   They swayed from the summit we'd leapt upon,
      And madly we entered in.

   "On end for plunder, 'mid rain and thunder
   That burst with the lull of our cannonade,
   We vamped the streets in the stifling air -- 
   Our hunger unsoothed, our thirst unstayed -- 
      And ransacked the buildings there.

   "Down the stony steps of the house-fronts white
   We rolled rich puncheons of Spanish grape,
   Till at length, with the fire of the wine alight,
   I saw at a doorway a fair fresh shape -- 
      A woman, a sylph, or sprite.

   "Afeard she fled, and with heated head
   I pursued to the chamber she called her own;
   -- When might is right no qualms deter,
   And having her helpless and alone
      I wreaked my will on her.

   "She raised her beseeching eyes to me,
   And I heard the words of prayer she sent
   In her own soft language . . . Seemingly
   I copied those eyes for my punishment
      In begetting the girl you see!

   "So, to-day I stand with a God-set brand
   Like Cain's, when he wandered from kindred's ken . . .
   I served through the war that made Europe free;
   I wived me in peace-year.  But, hid from men,
      I bear that mark on me.

   "And I nightly stray on the Ivel Way
   As though at home there were spectres rife;
   I delight me not in my proud career;
   And 'tis coals of fire that a gracious wife
      Should have brought me a daughter dear!"




THE STRANGER'S SONG


               O MY trade it is the rarest one,
   Simple shepherds all -- 
         My trade is a sight to see;
   For my customers I tie, and take 'em up on high,
      And waft 'em to a far countree!

   My tools are but common ones,
               Simple shepherds all -- 
         My tools are no sight to see:
   A little hempen string, and a post whereon to swing,
      Are implements enough for me!

   To-morrow is my working day,
            Simple shepherds all -- 
         To-morrow is a working day for me:
   For the farmer's sheep is slain, and the lad who did it ta'en,
      And on his soul may God ha' mer-cy!


                 



THE BURGHERS


   THE sun had wheeled from Grey's to Dammer's Crest,
   And still I mused on that Thing imminent:
   At length I sought the High-street to the West.

   The level flare raked pane and pediment
   And my wrecked face, and shaped my nearing friend
   Like one of those the Furnace held unshent.

   "I've news concerning her," he said.  "Attend.
   They fly to-night at the late moon's first gleam:
   Watch with thy steel: two righteous thrusts will end

   Her shameless visions and his passioned dream.
   I'll watch with thee, to testify thy wrong -- 
   To aid, maybe. -- Law consecrates the scheme."

   I started, and we paced the flags along
   Till I replied: "Since it has come to this
   I'll do it!  But alone.  I can be strong."

   Three hours past Curfew, when the Froom's mild hiss
   Reigned sole, undulled by whirr of merchandize,
   From Pummery-Tout to where the Gibbet is,

   I crossed my pleasaunce hard by Glyd'path Rise,
   And stood beneath the wall.  Eleven strokes went,
   And to the door they came, contrariwise,

   And met in clasp so close I had but bent
   My lifted blade upon them to have let
   Their two souls loose upon the firmament.

   But something held my arm.  "A moment yet
   As pray-time ere you wantons die!" I said;
   And then they saw me.  Swift her gaze was set

   With eye and cry of love illimited
   Upon her Heart-king.  Never upon me
   Had she thrown look of love so thorough-sped! . . .

   At once she flung her faint form shieldingly
   On his, against the vengeance of my vows;
   The which o'erruling, her shape shielded he.

   Blanked by such love, I stood as in a drowse,
   And the slow moon edged from the upland nigh,
   My sad thoughts moving thuswise: "I may house

   And I may husband her, yet what am I
   But licensed tyrant to this bonded pair?
   Says Charity, Do as ye would be done by." . . .

   Hurling my iron to the bushes there,
   I bade them stay.  And, as if brain and breast
   Were passive, they walked with me to the stair.

   Inside the house none watched; and on we prest
   Before a mirror, in whose gleam I read
   Her beauty, his, -- and mine own mien unblest;

   Till at her room I turned.  "Madam," I said,
   "Have you the wherewithal for this?  Pray speak.
   Love fills no cupboard.  You'll need daily bread."

   "We've nothing, sire," said she; "and nothing seek.
   'Twere base in me to rob my lord unware;
   Our hands will earn a pittance week by week."

   And next I saw she'd piled her raiment rare
   Within the garde-robes, and her household purse,
   Her jewels, and least lace of personal wear;

   And stood in homespun.  Now grown wholly hers,
   I handed her the gold, her jewels all,
   And him the choicest of her robes diverse.

   "I'll take you to the doorway in the wall,
   And then adieu," I to them.  "Friends, withdraw."
   They did so; and she went -- beyond recall.

   And as I paused beneath the arch I saw
   Their moonlit figures -- slow, as in surprise -- 
   Descend the slope, and vanish on the haw.

   "`Fool,` some will say," I thought.  "But who is wise,
   Save God alone, to weigh my reasons why?"
   -- "Hast thou struck home?" came with the boughs' night-sighs.

   It was my friend.  "I have struck well.  They fly,
   But carry wounds that none can cicatrize."
   -- "Not mortal?" said he.  "Lingering -- worse," said I.




LEIPZIG


      Scene: The Master-tradesmen's Parlour at the Old Ship Inn,
                       Casterbridge.  Evening.

   "OLD Norbert with the flat blue cap -- 
      A German said to be -- 
   Why let your pipe die on your lap,
      Your eyes blink absently?" -- 

   -- "Ah! . . . Well, I had thought till my cheek was wet
      Of my mother -- her voice and mien
   When she used to sing and pirouette,
      And touse the tambourine

   "To the march that yon street-fiddler plies:
      She told me 'twas the same
   She'd heard from the trumpets, when the Allies
      Her city overcame.

   "My father was one of the German Hussars,
      My mother of Leipzig; but he,
   Long quartered here, fetched her at close of the wars,
      And a Wessex lad reared me.

   "And as I grew up, again and again
      She'd tell, after trilling that air,
   Of her youth, and the battles on Leipzig plain
      And of all that was suffered there! . . .

   " -- 'Twas a time of alarms.  Three Chiefs-at-arms
      Combined them to crush One,
   And by numbers' might, for in equal fight
      He stood the matched of none.

   "Carl Schwarzenberg was of the plot,
      And Bl cher, prompt and prow,
   And Jean the Crown-Prince Bernadotte:
      Buonaparte was the foe.

   "City and plain had felt his reign
      From the North to the Middle Sea,
   And he'd now sat down in the noble town
      Of the King of Saxony.

   "October's deep dew its wet gossamer threw
      Upon Leipzig's lawns, leaf-strewn,
   Where lately each fair avenue
      Wrought shade for summer noon.

   "To westward two dull rivers crept
      Through miles of marsh and slough,
   Whereover a streak of whiteness swept -- 
      The Bridge of Lindenau.

   "Hard by, in the City, the One, care-tossed,
      Gloomed over his shrunken power;
   And without the walls the hemming host
      Waxed denser every hour.

   "He had speech that night on the morrow's designs
      With his chiefs by the bivouac fire,
   While the belt of flames from the enemy's lines
      Flared nigher him yet and nigher.

   "Three sky-lights then from the girdling trine
      Told,`Ready!`  As they rose
   Their flashes seemed his Judgment-Sign
      For bleeding Europe's woes.

   "'Twas seen how the French watch-fires that night
      Glowed still and steadily;
   And the Three rejoiced, for they read in the sight
      That the One disdained to flee . . .

   " -- Five hundred guns began the affray
      On next day morn at nine;
   Such mad and mangling cannon-play
      Had never torn human line.

   "Around the town three battles beat,
      Contracting like a gin;
   As nearer marched the million feet
      Of columns closing in.

   "The first battle nighed on the low Southern side;
      The second by the Western way;
   The nearing of the third on the North was heard:
      -- The French held all at bay.

   "Against the first band did the Emperor stand;
      Against the second stood Ney;
   Marmont against the third gave the order-word:
      -- Thus raged it throughout the day.

   "Fifty thousand sturdy souls on those trampled plains and knolls,
      Who met the dawn hopefully,
   And were lotted their shares in a quarrel not theirs,
      Dropt then in their agony.

   "`O,` the old folks said,`ye Preachers stern!
      O so-called Christian time!
   When will men's swords to ploughshares turn?
      When come the promised prime?` . . .

   " -- The clash of horse and man which that day began,
      Closed not as evening wore;
   And the morrow's armies, rear and van,
      Still mustered more and more.

   "From the City towers the Confederate Powers
      Were eyed in glittering lines,
   And up from the vast a murmuring passed
      As from a wood of pines.

   "`'Tis well to cover a feeble skill
      By numbers!` scoff d He;
  `But give me a third of their strength, I'd fill
      Half Hell with their soldiery!`

               
   "All that day raged the war they waged,
      And again dumb night held reign,
   Save that ever upspread from the dark deathbed
      A miles-wide pant of pain.

   "Hard had striven brave Ney, the true Bertrand,
      Victor, and Augereau,
   Bold Poniatowski, and Lauriston,
      To stay their overthrow;

   "But, as in the dream of one sick to death
      There comes a narrowing room
   That pens him, body and limbs and breath,
      To wait a hideous doom,

   "So to Napoleon, in the hush
      That held the town and towers
   Through these dire nights, a creeping crush
      Seemed inborne with the hours.

   "One road to the rearward, and but one,
      Did fitful Chance allow;
   'Twas where the Pleiss' and Elster run -- 
      The Bridge of Lindenau.

   "The nineteenth dawned.  Down street and Platz
      The wasted French sank back,
   Stretching long lines across the Flats
      And on the bridge-way track;

   "When there surged on the sky an earthen wave,
      And stones, and men, as though
   Some rebel churchyard crew updrave
      Their sepulchres from below.

   "To Heaven is blown Bridge Lindenau;
      Wrecked regiments reel therefrom;
   And rank and file in masses plough
      The sullen Elster-Strom.

   "A gulf was Lindenau; and dead
      Were fifties, hundreds, tens;
   And every current rippled red
      With Marshal's blood and men's.

   "The smart Macdonald swam therein,
      And barely won the verge;
   Bold Poniatowski plunged him in
      Never to re-emerge.

   "Then stayed the strife.  The remnants wound
      Their Rhineward way pell-mell;
   And thus did Leipzig City sound
      An Empire's passing bell;

   "While in cavalcade, with band and blade,
      Came Marshals, Princes, Kings;
   And the town was theirs . . . Ay, as simple maid,
      My mother saw these things!

   "And whenever those notes in the street begin,
      I recall her, and that far scene,
   And her acting of how the Allies marched in,
      And her touse of the tambourine!"

  



THE PEASANT'S CONFESSION



   GOOD Father! . . . 'Twas an eve in middle June,
      And war was waged anew
   By great Napoleon, who for years had strewn
      Men's bones all Europe through.

   Three nights ere this, with columned corps he'd crossed
      The Sambre at Charleroi,
   To move on Brussels, where the English host
      Dallied in Parc and Bois.

   The yestertide we'd heard the gloomy gun
      Growl through the long-sunned day
   From Quatre-Bras and Ligny; till the dun
      Twilight suppressed the fray;

   Albeit therein -- as lated tongues bespoke -- 
      Brunswick's high heart was drained,
   And Prussia's Line and Landwehr, though unbroke,
      Stood cornered and constrained.

   And at next noon-time Grouchy slowly passed
      With thirty thousand men:
   We hoped thenceforth no army, small or vast,
      Would trouble us again.

   My hut lay deeply in a vale recessed,
      And never a soul seemed nigh
   When, reassured at length, we went to rest -- 
      My children, wife, and I.

   But what was this that broke our humble ease?
      What noise, above the rain,
   Above the dripping of the poplar trees
      That smote along the pane?

   -- A call of mastery, bidding me arise,
      Compelled me to the door,
   At which a horseman stood in martial guise -- 
      Splashed -- sweating from every pore.

   Had I seen Grouchy?  Yes?  Which track took he?
      Could I lead thither on? -- 
   Fulfilment would ensure gold pieces three,
      Perchance more gifts anon.

   "I bear the Emperor's mandate," then he said,
      "Charging the Marshal straight
   To strike between the double host ahead
      Ere they co-operate,

   "Engaging Bl cher till the Emperor put
      Lord Wellington to flight,
   And next the Prussians.  This to set afoot
      Is my emprise to-night."

   I joined him in the mist; but, pausing, sought
      To estimate his say.
   Grouchy had made for Wavre; and yet, on thought,
      I did not lead that way.

   I mused: "If Grouchy thus instructed be,
      The clash comes sheer hereon;
   My farm is stript.  While, as for pieces three,
      Money the French have none.

   "Grouchy unwarned, moreo'er, the English win,
      And mine is left to me -- 
   They buy, not borrow." -- Hence did I begin
      To lead him treacherously.

   By Joidoigne, near to east, as we ondrew,
      Dawn pierced the humid air;
   And eastward faced I with him, though I knew
      Never marched Grouchy there.

   Near Ottignies we passed, across the Dyle
      (Lim'lette left far aside),
   And thence direct toward Pervez and Noville
      Through green grain, till he cried:

   "I doubt thy conduct, man! no track is here -- 
      I doubt thy gag d word!"
   Thereat he scowled on me, and pranced me near,
      And pricked me with his sword.

   "Nay, Captain, hold!  We skirt, not trace the course
      Of Grouchy," said I then:
   "As we go, yonder went he, with his force
      Of thirty thousand men."

   -- At length noon nighed; when west, from Saint-John's-Mound,
      A hoarse artillery boomed,
   And from Saint-Lambert's upland, chapel-crowned,
      The Prussian squadrons loomed.

   Then to the wayless wet gray ground he leapt;
      "My mission fails!" he cried;
   "Too late for Grouchy now to intercept,
      For, peasant, you have lied!"

   He turned to pistol me.  I sprang, and drew
      The sabre from his flank,
   And 'twixt his nape and shoulder, ere he knew,
      I struck, and dead he sank.

                     
   I hid him deep in nodding rye and oat -- 
      His shroud green stalks and loam;
   His requiem the corn-blade's husky note -- 
      And then I hastened home, . . .

   -- Two armies writhe in coils of red and blue,
      And brass and iron clang
   From Goumont, past the front of Waterloo,
      To Pap'lotte and Smohain.

   The Guard Imperial wavered on the height;
      The Emperor's face grew glum;
   "I sent," he said, "to Grouchy yesternight,
      And yet he does not come!"

   'Twas then, Good Father, that the French espied,
      Streaking the summer land,
   The men of Bl cher.  But the Emperor cried,
      "Grouchy is now at hand!"

   And meanwhile Vand'leur, Vivian, Maitland, Kempt,
      Met d'Erlon, Friant, Ney;
   But Grouchy -- mis-sent, blamed, yet blame-exempt -- 
      Grouchy was far away.

   By even, slain or struck, Michel the strong,
      Bold Travers, Dnop, Delord,
   Smart Guyot, Reil-le, l'Heriter, Friant,
      Scattered that champaign o'er.

   Fallen likewise wronged Duhesme, and skilled Lobau
      Did that red sunset see;
   Colbert, Legros, Blancard! . . . And of the foe
      Picton and Ponsonby;

   With Gordon, Canning, Blackman, Ompteda,
      L'Estrange, Delancey, Packe,
   Grose, D'Oyly, Stables, Morice, Howard, Hay,
      Von Schwerin, Watzdorf, Boek,

   Smith, Phelips, Fuller, Lind, and Battersby,
      And hosts of ranksmen round . . .
   Memorials linger yet to speak to thee
      Of those that bit the ground!

   The Guards' last column yielded; dykes of dead
      Lay between vale and ridge,
   As, thinned yet closing, faint yet fierce, they sped
      In packs to Genappe Bridge.

   Safe was my stock; my capple cow unslain;
         Intact each cock and hen;
   But Grouchy far at Wavre all day had lain,
      And thirty thousand men.

   O Saints, had I but lost my earing corn
      And saved the cause once prized!
   O Saints, why such false witness had I borne
      When late I'd sympathized! . . .

   So now, being old, my children eye askance
      My slowly dwindling store,
   And crave my mite; till, worn with tarriance,
      I care for life no more.

   To Almighty God henceforth I stand confessed,
      And Virgin-Saint Marie;
   O Michael, John, and Holy Ones in rest,
      Entreat the Lord for me!

            



THE ALARM


                       See "The Trumpet-Major"

            IN MEMORY OF ONE OF THE WRITER'S FAMILY WHO WAS A
                  VOLUNTEER DURING THE WAR WITH NAPOLEON

         IN a ferny byway
         Near the great South-Wessex Highway,
      A homestead raised its breakfast-smoke aloft;
   The dew-damps still lay steamless, for the sun had made no sky-way,
         And twilight cloaked the croft.

         'Twas hard to realize on
         This snug side the mute horizon
      That beyond it hostile armaments might steer,
   Save from seeing in the porchway a fair woman weep with eyes on
         A harnessed Volunteer.

         In haste he'd flown there
         To his comely wife alone there,
      While marching south hard by, to still her fears,
   For she soon would be a mother, and few messengers were known there
         In these campaigning years.

         'Twas time to be Good-bying,
         Since the assembly-hour was nighing
      In royal George's town at six that morn;
   And betwixt its wharves and this retreat were ten good miles of hieing
      Ere ring of bugle-horn.

         "I've laid in food, Dear,
         And broached the spiced and brewed, Dear;
      And if our July hope should antedate,
   Let the char-wench mount and gallop by the halterpath and wood, Dear,
         And fetch assistance straight.

         "As for Buonaparte, forget him;
         He's not like to land!  But let him,
      Those strike with aim who strike for wives and sons!
   And the war-boats built to float him; 'twere but wanted to upset him
         A slat from Nelson's guns!

         "But, to assure thee,
         And of creeping fears to cure thee,
      If he should be rumoured anchoring in the Road,
   Drive with the nurse to Kingsbere; and let nothing thence allure thee
         Till we've him safe-bestowed.

         "Now, to turn to marching matters: -- 
         I've my knapsack, firelock, spatters,
      Crossbelts, priming-horn, stock, bay'net, blackball, clay,
   Pouch, magazine, flints, flint-box that at every quick-step clatters;
      . . . My heart, Dear; that must stay!"

         -- With breathings broken
         Farewell was kissed unspoken,
      And they parted there as morning stroked the panes;
   And the Volunteer went on, and turned, and twirled his glove for
   token,
      And took the coastward lanes.

         When above He'th Hills he found him,
         He saw, on gazing round him,
      The Barrow-Beacon burning -- burning low,
   As if, perhaps, uplighted ever since he'd homeward bound him;
         And it meant: Expect the Foe!

     
         Leaving the byway,
         And following swift the highway,
      Car and chariot met he, faring fast inland;
   "He's anchored, Soldier!" shouted some: "God save thee, marching thy
   way,
      Th'lt front him on the strand!"

         He slowed; he stopped; he paltered
         Awhile with self, and faltered,
      "Why courting misadventure shoreward roam?
   To Molly, surely!  Seek the woods with her till times have altered;
         Charity favours home.

         "Else, my denying
         He would come she'll read as lying -- 
      Think the Barrow-Beacon must have met my eyes -- 
   That my words were not unwareness, but deceit of her, while trying
         My life to jeopardize.

         "At home is stocked provision,
         And to-night, without suspicion,
      We might bear it with us to a covert near;
   Such sin, to save a childing wife, would earn it Christ's remission,
      Though none forgive it here!"

         While thus he, thinking,
         A little bird, quick drinking
      Among the crowfoot tufts the river bore,
   Was tangled in their stringy arms, and fluttered, well-nigh sinking,
      Near him, upon the moor.

         He stepped in, reached, and seized it,
         And, preening, had released it
      But that a thought of Holy Writ occurred,
   And Signs Divine ere battle, till it seemed him Heaven had pleased it
      As guide to send the bird.

         "O Lord, direct me! . . .
         Doth Duty now expect me
      To march a-coast, or guard my weak ones near?
   Give this bird a flight according, that I thence know to elect me
      The southward or the rear."

         He loosed his clasp; when, rising,
         The bird -- as if surmising -- 
      Bore due to southward, crossing by the Froom,
   And Durnover Great-Field and Fort, the soldier clear advising -- 
         Prompted he wist by Whom.

         Then on he panted
         By grim Mai-Don, and slanted
      Up the steep Ridge-way, hearkening betwixt whiles;
   Till, nearing coast and harbour, he beheld the shore-line planted
      With Foot and Horse for miles.

         Mistrusting not the omen,
         He gained the beach, where Yeomen,
      Militia, Fencibles, and Pikemen bold,
   With Regulars in thousands, were enmassed to meet the Foemen,
      Whose fleet had not yet shoaled.

         Captain and Colonel,
         Sere Generals, Ensigns vernal,
      Were there; of neighbour-natives, Michel, Smith,
   Meggs, Bingham, Gambier, Cunningham, roused by the hued nocturnal
      Swoop on their land and kith.

         But Buonaparte still tarried;
         His project had miscarried;
      At the last hour, equipped for victory,
   The fleet had paused; his subtle combinations had been parried
      By British strategy.

         Homeward returning
         Anon, no beacons burning,
      No alarms, the Volunteer, in modest bliss,
   Te Deum sang with wife and friends: "We praise Thee, Lord, discerning
         That Thou hast helped in this!"




HER DEATH AND AFTER


   'TWAS a death-bed summons, and forth I went
   By the way of the Western Wall, so drear
   On that winter night, and sought a gate -- 
         The home, by Fate,
      Of one I had long held dear.

   And there, as I paused by her tenement,
   And the trees shed on me their rime and hoar,
   I thought of the man who had left her lone -- 
         Him who made her his own
      When I loved her, long before.

   The rooms within had the piteous shine
   That home-things wear when there's aught amiss;
   From the stairway floated the rise and fall
         Of an infant's call,
      Whose birth had brought her to this.

   Her life was the price she would pay for that whine -- 
   For a child by the man she did not love.
   "But let that rest for ever," I said,
         And bent my tread
      To the chamber up above.

   She took my hand in her thin white own,
   And smiled her thanks -- though nigh too weak -- 
   And made them a sign to leave us there
         Then faltered, ere
      She could bring herself to speak.

   "'Twas to see you before I go -- he'll condone
   Such a natural thing now my time's not much -- 
   When Death is so near it hustles hence
         All passioned sense
      Between woman and man as such!

   "My husband is absent.  As heretofore
   The City detains him.  But, in truth,
   He has not been kind . . . I will speak no blame,
         But -- the child is lame;
      O, I pray she may reach his ruth!

   "Forgive past days -- I can say no more -- 
   Maybe if we'd wedded you'd now repine! . . .
   But I treated you ill.  I was punished.  Farewell!
         -- Truth shall I tell?
      Would the child were yours and mine!

   "As a wife I was true.  But, such my unease
   That, could I insert a deed back in Time,
   I'd make her yours, to secure your care;
         And the scandal bear,
      And the penalty for the crime!"

   -- When I had left, and the swinging trees
   Rang above me, as lauding her candid say,
   Another was I.  Her words were enough:
         Came smooth, came rough,
      I felt I could live my day.

   Next night she died; and her obsequies
   In the Field of Tombs, by the Via renowned,
   Had her husband's heed.  His tendance spent,
         I often went
      And pondered by her mound.

   All that year and the next year whiled,
   And I still went thitherward in the gloam;
   But the Town forgot her and her nook,
         And her husband took
      Another Love to his home.

   And the rumour flew that the lame lone child
   Whom she wished for its safety child of mine,
   Was treated ill when offspring came
         Of the new-made dame,
      And marked a more vigorous line.

                     
   A smarter grief within me wrought
   Than even at loss of her so dear;
   Dead the being whose soul my soul suffused,
         Her child ill-used,
      I helpless to interfere!

   One eve as I stood at my spot of thought
   In the white-stoned Garth, brooding thus her wrong,
   Her husband neared; and to shun his view
         By her hallowed mew
      I went from the tombs among

   To the Cirque of the Gladiators which faced -- 
   That haggard mark of Imperial Rome,
   Whose Pagan echoes mock the chime
         Of our Christian time:
      It was void, and I inward clomb.

   Scarce night the sun's gold touch displaced
   From the vast Rotund and the neighbouring dead
   When her husband followed; bowed; half-passed,
         With lip upcast;
      Then, halting, sullenly said:

   "It is noised that you visit my first wife's tomb.
   Now, I gave her an honoured name to bear
   While living, when dead.  So I've claim to ask
         By what right you task
      My patience by vigiling there?

   "There's decency even in death, I assume;
   Preserve it, sir, and keep away;
   For the mother of my first-born you
         Show mind undue!
      -- Sir, I've nothing more to say."

   A desperate stroke discerned I then -- 
   God pardon -- or pardon not -- the lie;
   She had sighed that she wished (lest the child should pine
         Of slights) 'twere mine,
      So I said: "But the father I.

   "That you thought it yours is the way of men;
   But I won her troth long ere your day:
   You learnt how, in dying, she summoned me?
         'Twas in fealty.
      -- Sir, I've nothing more to say,

   "Save that, if you'll hand me my little maid,
   I'll take her, and rear her, and spare you toil.
   Think it more than a friendly act none can;
         I'm a lonely man,
      While you've a large pot to boil.

   "If not, and you'll put it to ball or blade -- 
   To-night, to-morrow night, anywhen -- 
   I'll meet you here . . . But think of it,
         And in season fit
      Let me hear from you again."

   -- Well, I went away, hoping; but nought I heard
   Of my stroke for the child, till there greeted me
   A little voice that one day came
         To my window-frame
      And babbled innocently:

   "My father who's not my own, sends word
   I'm to stay here, sir, where I belong!"
   Next a writing came: "Since the child was the fruit
         Of your lawless suit,
      Pray take her, to right a wrong."

   And I did.  And I gave the child my love,
   And the child loved me, and estranged us none.
   But compunctions loomed; for I'd harmed the dead
         By what I'd said
      For the good of the living one.

   -- Yet though, God wot, I am sinner enough,
   And unworthy the woman who drew me so,
   Perhaps this wrong for her darling's good
         She forgives, or would,
      If only she could know!

                  
                                    

            



THE DANCE AT THE PHOENIX


   TO Jenny came a gentle youth
      From inland leazes lone,
   His love was fresh as apple-blooth
      By Parrett, Yeo, or Tone.
   And duly he entreated her
   To be his tender minister,
      And call him aye her own.

   Fair Jenny's life had hardly been
      A life of modesty;
   At Casterbridge experience keen
      Of many loves had she
   From scarcely sixteen years above;
   Among them sundry troopers of
      The King's-Own Cavalry.

   But each with charger, sword, and gun,
      Had bluffed the Biscay wave;
   And Jenny prized her gentle one
      For all the love he gave.
   She vowed to be, if they were wed,
   His honest wife in heart and head
      From bride-ale hour to grave.

   Wedded they were.  Her husband's trust
      In Jenny knew no bound,
   And Jenny kept her pure and just,
      Till even malice found
   No sin or sign of ill to be
   In one who walked so decently
      The duteous helpmate's round.

   Two sons were born, and bloomed to men,
      And roamed, and were as not:
   Alone was Jenny left again
      As ere her mind had sought
   A solace in domestic joys,
   And ere the vanished pair of boys
      Were sent to sun her cot.

   She numbered near on sixty years,
      And passed as elderly,
   When, in the street, with flush of fears,
      One day discovered she,
   From shine of swords and thump of drum.
   Her early loves from war had come,
      The King's-Own Cavalry.

   She turned aside, and bowed her head
      Anigh Saint Peter's door;
   "Alas for chastened thoughts!" she said;
      "I'm faded now, and hoar,
   And yet those notes -- they thrill me through,
   And those gay forms move me anew
      As in the years of yore!" . . .

   'Twas Christmas, and the Phoenix Inn
      Was lit with tapers tall,
   For thirty of the trooper men
      Had vowed to give a ball
   As "Theirs" had done ('twas handed down)
   When lying in the selfsame town
      Ere Buonapart 's fall.

   That night the throbbing "Soldier's Joy,"
      The measured tread and sway
   Of "Fancy-Lad" and "Maiden Coy,"
      Reached Jenny as she lay
   Beside her spouse; till springtide blood
   Seemed scouring through her like a flood
      That whisked the years away.

   She rose, and rayed, and decked her head
      Where the bleached hairs ran thin;
   Upon her cap two bows of red
      She fixed with hasty pin;
   Unheard descending to the street,
   She trod the flags with tune-led feet,
      And stood before the Inn.

   Save for the dancers', not a sound
      Disturbed the icy air;
   No watchman on his midnight round
      Or traveller was there;
   But over All-Saints', high and bright,
   Pulsed to the music Sirius white,
      The Wain by Bullstake Square.

   She knocked, but found her further stride
      Checked by a sergeant tall:
   "Gay Granny, whence come you?" he cried;
      "This is a private ball."
   -- "No one has more right here than me!
   Ere you were born, man," answered she,
      "I knew the regiment all!"

   "Take not the lady's visit ill!"
      Upspoke the steward free;
   "We lack sufficient partners still,
      So, prithee let her be!"
   They seized and whirled her 'mid the maze,
   And Jenny felt as in the days
      Of her immodesty.

   Hour chased each hour, and night advanced;
      She sped as shod with wings;
   Each time and every time she danced -- 
      Reels, jigs, poussettes, and flings:
   They cheered her as she soared and swooped,
   (She'd learnt ere art in dancing drooped
      From hops to slothful swings).

   The favourite Quick-step "Speed the Plough" -- 
      (Cross hands, cast off, and wheel) -- 
   "The Triumph," "Sylph," "The Row-dow-dow,"
      Famed "Major Malley's Reel,"
   "The Duke of York's," "The Fairy Dance,"
   "The Bridge of Lodi" (brought from France),
      She beat out, toe and heel.

   The "Fall of Paris" clanged its close,
      And Peter's chime told four,
   When Jenny, bosom-beating, rose
      To seek her silent door.
   They tiptoed in escorting her,
   Lest stroke of heel or clink of spur
      Should break her goodman's snore.

   The fire that late had burnt fell slack
      When lone at last stood she;
   Her nine-and-fifty years came back;
      She sank upon her knee
   Beside the durn, and like a dart
   A something arrowed through her heart
      In shoots of agony.

   Their footsteps died as she leant there,
      Lit by the morning star
   Hanging above the moorland, where
      The aged elm-rows are;
   And, as o'ernight, from Pummery Ridge
   To Maembury Ring and Standfast Bridge
      No life stirred, near or far.

   Though inner mischief worked amain,
      She reached her husband's side;
   Where, toil-weary, as he had lain
      Beneath the patchwork pied
   When yestereve she'd forthward crept,
   And as unwitting, still he slept
      Who did in her confide.

   A tear sprang as she turned and viewed
      His features free from guile;
   She kissed him long, as when, just wooed,
      She chose his domicile.
   She felt she could have given her life
   To be the single-hearted wife
      That she had been erstwhile.

   Time wore to six.  Her husband rose
      And struck the steel and stone;
   He glanced at Jenny, whose repose
      Seemed deeper than his own.
   With dumb dismay, on closer sight,
   He gathered sense that in the night,
      Or morn, her soul had flown.

   When told that some too mighty strain
      For one so many-yeared
   Had burst her bosom's master-vein,
      His doubts remained unstirred.
   His Jenny had not left his side
   Betwixt the eve and morning-tide:
      -- The King's said not a word.

   Well! times are not as times were then,
      Nor fair ones half so free;
   And truly they were martial men,
      The King's-Own Cavalry.
   And when they went from Casterbridge
   And vanished over Mellstock Ridge,
      'Twas saddest morn to see.

             
                                    

                   



THE CASTERBRIDGE CAPTAINS


              A TRADITION OF J. B. L--, T. G. B--, AND J. L--.

   THREE captains went to Indian wars,
      And only one returned:
   Their mate of yore, he singly wore
      The laurels all had earned.

   At home he sought the ancient aisle
      Wherein, untrumped of fame,
   The three had sat in pupilage,
      And each had carved his name.

   The names, rough-hewn, of equal size,
      Stood on the panel still;
   Unequal since. -- "'Twas theirs to aim,
      Mine was it to fulfil!"

   -- "Who saves his life shall lose it, friends!"
      Outspake the preacher then,
   Unweeting he his listener, who
      Looked at the names again.

   That he had come and they'd been stayed,
      'Twas but the chance of war:
   Another chance, and they'd sat here,
      And he had lain afar.

   Yet saw he something in the lives
      Of those who'd ceased to live
   That sphered them with a majesty
      Which living failed to give.

   Transcendent triumph in return
      No longer lit his brain;
   Transcendence rayed the distant urn
      Where slept the fallen twain.

                       



A SIGN-SEEKER


   I MARK the months in liveries dank and dry,
      The noontides many-shaped and hued;
      I see the nightfall shades subtrude,
   And hear the monotonous hours clang negligently by.

   I view the evening bonfires of the sun
      On hills where morning rains have hissed;
      The eyeless countenance of the mist
   Pallidly rising when the summer droughts are done.

   I have seen the lightning-blade, the leaping star,
      The cauldrons of the sea in storm,
      Have felt the earthquake's lifting arm,
   And trodden where abysmal fires and snow-cones are.

   I learn to prophesy the hid eclipse,
      The coming of eccentric orbs;
      To mete the dust the sky absorbs,
   To weigh the sun, and fix the hour each planet dips.

   I witness fellow earth-men surge and strive;
      Assemblies meet, and throb, and part;
      Death's soothing finger, sorrow's smart;
   -- All the vast various moils that mean a world alive.

   But that I fain would wot of shuns my sense -- 
      Those sights of which old prophets tell,
      Those signs the general word so well,
   Vouchsafed to their unheed, denied my long suspense.

   In graveyard green, behind his monument
      To glimpse a phantom parent, friend,
      Wearing his smile, and "Not the end!"
   Outbreathing softly: that were blest enlightenment;

   Or, if a dead Love's lips, whom dreams reveal
      When midnight imps of King Decay
      Delve sly to solve me back to clay,
   Should leave some print to prove her spirit-kisses real;

   Or, when Earth's Frail lie bleeding of her Strong,
      If some Recorder, as in Writ,
      Near to the weary scene should flit
   And drop one plume as pledge that Heaven inscrolls the wrong.

   -- There are who, rapt to heights of tranc d trust,
      These tokens claim to feel and see,
      Read radiant hints of times to be -- 
   Of heart to heart returning after dust to dust.

   Such scope is granted not to lives like mine . . .
      I have lain in dead men's beds, have walked
      The tombs of those with whom I'd talked,
   Called many a gone and goodly one to shape a sign,

   And panted for response.  But none replies;
      No warnings loom, nor whisperings
      To open out my limitings,
   And Nescience mutely muses: When a man falls he lies.

       



MY CICELY


   "ALIVE?" -- And I leapt in my wonder,
      Was faint of my joyance,
   And grasses and grove shone in garments
      Of glory to me.

   "She lives, in a plenteous well-being,
      To-day as aforehand;
   The dead bore the name -- though a rare one -- 
      The name that bore she."

   She lived . . . I, afar in the city
      Of frenzy-led factions,
   Had squandered green years and maturer
      In bowing the knee

   To Baals illusive and specious,
      Till chance had there voiced me
   That one I loved vainly in nonage
      Had ceased her to be.

   The passion the planets had scowled on,
      And change had let dwindle,
   Her death-rumour smartly relifted
      To full apogee.

   I mounted a steed in the dawning
      With acheful remembrance,
   And made for the ancient West Highway
      To far Exonb'ry.

   Passing heaths, and the House of Long Sieging,
      I neared the thin steeple
   That tops the fair fane of Poore's olden
      Episcopal see;

   And, changing anew my onbearer,
      I traversed the downland
   Whereon the bleak hill-graves of Chieftains
      Bulge barren of tree;

   And still sadly onward I followed
      That Highway the Icen,
   Which trails its pale riband down Wessex
      O'er lynchet and lea.

   Along through the Stour-bordered Forum,
      Where Legions had wayfared,
   And where the slow river upglasses
      Its green canopy,

   And by Weatherbury Castle, and thencefrom
      Through Casterbridge held I
   Still on, to entomb her my vision
      Saw stretched pallidly.

   No highwayman's trot blew the night-wind
      To me so life-weary,
   But only the creak of the gibbets
      Or waggoners' jee.

   Triple-ramparted Maidon gloomed grayly
      Above me from southward,
   And north the hill-fortress of Eggar,
      And square Pummerie.

   The Nine-Pillared Cromlech, the Bride-streams,
      The Axe, and the Otter
   I passed, to the gate of the city
      Where Exe scents the sea;

   Till, spent, in the graveacre pausing,
      I learnt 'twas not my Love
   To whom Mother Church had just murmured
      A last lullaby.

   -- "Then, where dwells the Canon's kinswoman,
      My friend of aforetime?" -- 
   ('Twas hard to repress my heart-heavings
      And new ecstasy.)

   "She wedded." -- "Ah!" -- "Wedded beneath her -- 
      She keeps the stage-hostel
   Ten miles hence, beside the great Highway -- 
      The famed Lions-Three.

   "Her spouse was her lackey -- no option
      'Twixt wedlock and worse things;
   A lapse over-sad for a lady
      Of her pedigree!"

   I shuddered, said nothing, and wandered
      To shades of green laurel:
   Too ghastly had grown those first tidings
      So brightsome of blee!

   For, on my ride hither, I'd halted
      Awhile at the Lions,
   And her -- her whose name had once opened
      My heart as a key -- 

   I'd looked on, unknowing, and witnessed
      Her jests with the tapsters,
   Her liquor-fired face, her thick accents
      In naming her fee.

   "O God, why this seeming derision!"
      I cried in my anguish:
   "O once Loved, O fair Unforgotten -- 
      That Thing -- meant it thee!

   "Inurned and at peace, lost but sainted,
      Were grief I could compass;
   Depraved -- 'tis for Christ's poor dependent
      A cruel decree!"

   I backed on the Highway; but passed not
      The hostel.  Within there
   Too mocking to Love's re-expression
      Was Time's repartee!

   Uptracking where Legions had wayfared,
      By cromlechs unstoried,
   And lynchets, and sepultured Chieftains,
      In self-colloquy,

   A feeling stirred in me and strengthened
      That she was not my Love,
   But she of the garth, who lay rapt in
      Her long reverie.

   And thence till to-day I persuade me
      That this was the true one;
   That Death stole intact her young dearness
      And innocency.

   Frail-witted, illuded they call me;
      I may be.  'Tis better
   To dream than to own the debasement
      Of sweet Cicely.

   Moreover I rate it unseemly
      To hold that kind Heaven
   Could work such device -- to her ruin
      And my misery.

   So, lest I disturb my choice vision,
      I shun the West Highway,
   Even now, when the knaps ring with rhythms
      From blackbird and bee;

   And feel that with slumber half-conscious
      She rests in the church-hay,
   Her spirit unsoiled as in youth-time
      When lovers were we.

                 
                                      

                  



HER IMMORTALITY


   UPON a noon I pilgrimed through
      A pasture, mile by mile,
   Unto the place where I last saw
      My dead Love's living smile.

   And sorrowing I lay me down
      Upon the heated sod:
   It seemed as if my body pressed
      The very ground she trod.

   I lay, and thought; and in a trance
      She came and stood me by -- 
   The same, even to the marvellous ray
      That used to light her eye.

   "You draw me, and I come to you,
      My faithful one," she said,
   In voice that had the moving tone
      It bore ere breath had fled.

   She said: "'Tis seven years since I died:
      Few now remember me;
   My husband clasps another bride;
      My children's love has she.

   "My brethren, sisters, and my friends
      Care not to meet my sprite:
   Who prized me most I did not know
      Till I passed down from sight."

   I said: "My days are lonely here;
      I need thy smile alway:
   I'll use this night my ball or blade,
      And join thee ere the day."

   A tremor stirred her tender lips,
      Which parted to dissuade:
   "That cannot be, O friend," she cried;
      "Think, I am but a Shade!

   "A Shade but in its mindful ones
      Has immortality;
   By living, me you keep alive,
      By dying you slay me.

   "In you resides my single power
      Of sweet continuance here;
   On your fidelity I count
      Through many a coming year."

   -- I started through me at her plight,
      So suddenly confessed:
   Dismissing late distaste for life,
      I craved its bleak unrest.

   "I will not die, my One of all! -- 
      To lengthen out thy days
   I'll guard me from minutest harms
      That may invest my ways!"

   She smiled and went.  Since then she comes
      Oft when her birth-moon climbs,
   Or at the seasons' ingresses
      Or anniversary times;

   But grows my grief.  When I surcease,
      Through whom alone lives she,
   Ceases my Love, her words, her ways,
      Never again to be!




THE IVY-WIFE


   I LONGED to love a full-boughed beech
      And be as high as he:
   I stretched an arm within his reach,
      And signalled unity.
   But with his drip he forced a breach,
      And tried to poison me.

   I gave the grasp of partnership
      To one of other race -- 
   A plane: he barked him strip by strip
      From upper bough to base;
   And me therewith; for gone my grip,
      My arms could not enlace.

   In new affection next I strove
      To coll an ash I saw,
   And he in trust received my love;
      Till with my soft green claw
   I cramped and bound him as I wove . . .
      Such was my love: ha-ha!

   By this I gained his strength and height
      Without his rivalry.
   But in my triumph I lost sight
      Of afterhaps.  Soon he,
   Being bark-bound, flagged, snapped, fell outright,
      And in his fall felled me!




A MEETING WITH DESPAIR


   AS evening shaped I found me on a moor
      Which sight could scarce sustain:
   The black lean land, of featureless contour,
      Was like a tract in pain.

   "This scene, like my own life," I said, "is one
      Where many glooms abide;
   Toned by its fortune to a deadly dun -- 
      Lightless on every side.

   I glanced aloft and halted, pleasure-caught
      To see the contrast there:
   The ray-lit clouds gleamed glory; and I thought,
      "There's solace everywhere!"

   Then bitter self-reproaches as I stood
      I dealt me silently
   As one perverse -- misrepresenting Good
      In graceless mutiny.

   Against the horizon's dim-discern d wheel
      A form rose, strange of mould:
   That he was hideous, hopeless, I could feel
      Rather than could behold.

   "'Tis a dead spot, where even the light lies spent
      To darkness!" croaked the Thing.
   "Not if you look aloft!" said I, intent
      On my new reasoning.

   "Yea -- but await awhile!" he cried.  "Ho-ho! -- 
      Look now aloft and see!"
   I looked.  There, too, sat night: Heaven's radiant show
      Had gone.  Then chuckled he.




UNKNOWING


   WHEN, soul in soul reflected,
   We breathed an aethered air,
      When we neglected
      All things elsewhere,
   And left the friendly friendless
   To keep our love aglow,
      We deemed it endless . . .
      -- We did not know!

   When, by mad passion goaded,
   We planned to hie away,
      But, unforeboded,
      The storm-shafts gray
   So heavily down-pattered
   That none could forthward go,
      Our lives seemed shattered . . .
      -- We did not know!

   When I found you, helpless lying,
   And you waived my deep misprise,
      And swore me, dying,
      In phantom-guise
   To wing to me when grieving,
   And touch away my woe,
      We kissed, believing . . .
      -- We did not know!

   But though, your powers outreckoning,
   You hold you dead and dumb,
      Or scorn my beckoning,
      And will not come;
   And I say, "'Twere mood ungainly
   To store her memory so:"
      I say it vainly -- 
      I feel and know!




FRIENDS BEYOND


   WILLIAM DEWY, Tranter Reuben, Farmer Ledlow late at plough,
      Robert's kin, and John's, and Ned's,
   And the Squire, and Lady Susan, lie in Mellstock churchyard now!

   "Gone," I call them, gone for good, that group of local hearts and
   heads;
      Yet at mothy curfew-tide,
   And at midnight when the noon-heat breathes it back from walls and
   leads,

   They've a way of whispering to me -- fellow-wight who yet abide -- 
      In the muted, measured note
   Of a ripple under archways, or a lone cave's stillicide:

   "We have triumphed: this achievement turns the bane to antidote,
      Unsuccesses to success,
   -- Many thought-worn eves and morrows to a morrow free of thought.

   "No more need we corn and clothing, feel of old terrestrial stress;
      Chill detraction stirs no sigh;
   Fear of death has even bygone us: death gave all that we possess."

   W. D. -- "Ye mid burn the wold bass-viol that I set such vallie by."
      Squire. -- "You may hold the manse in fee,
   You may wed my spouse, my children's memory of me may decry."

   Lady. -- "You may have my rich brocades, my laces; take each household
   key;
      Ransack coffer, desk, bureau;
   Quiz the few poor treasures hid there, con the letters kept by me."

   Far. -- "Ye mid zell my favourite heifer, ye mid let the charlock grow,
      Foul the grinterns, give up thrift."
   Wife. -- "If ye break my best blue china, children, I shan't care or
   ho."

   All. -- "We've no wish to hear the tidings, how the people's fortunes
   shift;
      What your daily doings are;
   Who are wedded, born, divided; if your lives beat slow or swift.

   "Curious not the least are we if our intents you make or mar,
      If you quire to our old tune,
   If the City stage still passes, if the weirs still roar afar."

   -- Thus, with very gods' composure, freed those crosses late and soon
      Which, in life, the Trine allow
   (Why, none witteth), and ignoring all that haps beneath the moon,

   William Dewy, Tranter Reuben, Farmer Ledlow late at plough,
      Robert's kin, and John's, and Ned's,
   And the Squire, and Lady Susan, murmur mildly to me now.

              



TO OUTER NATURE


   SHOW thee as I thought thee
   When I early sought thee,
      Omen-scouting,
      All undoubting
   Love alone had wrought thee -- 

   Wrought thee for my pleasure,
   Planned thee as a measure
      For expounding
      And resounding
   Glad things that men treasure.

   O for but a moment
   Of that old endowment -- 
      Light to gaily
      See thy daily
   Iris d embowment!

   But such re-adorning
   Time forbids with scorning -- 
      Makes me see things
      Cease to be things
   They were in my morning.

   Fad'st thou, glow-forsaken,
   Darkness-overtaken!
      Thy first sweetness,
      Radiance, meetness,
   None shall re-awaken.

   Why not sempiternal
   Thou and I?  Our vernal
      Brightness keeping,
      Time outleaping;
   Passed the hodiernal!




THOUGHTS OF PHENA
AT NEWS OF HER DEATH


         NOT a line of her writing have I,
            Not a thread of her hair,
   No mark of her late time as dame in her dwelling, whereby
         I may picture her there;
      And in vain do I urge my unsight
         To conceive my lost prize
   At her close, whom I knew when her dreams were upbrimming with light,
         And with laughter her eyes.

         What scenes spread around her last days,
            Sad, shining, or dim?
   Did her gifts and compassions enray and enarch her sweet ways
         With an aureate nimb?
      Or did life-light decline from her years,
         And mischances control
   Her full day-star; unease, or regret, or forebodings, or fears
         Disennoble her soul?

         Thus I do but the phantom retain
            Of the maiden of yore
   As my relic; yet haply the best of her -- fined in my brain
         It maybe the more
      That no line of her writing have I,
         Nor a thread of her hair,
   No mark of her late time as dame in her dwelling, whereby
         I may picture her there.


        



MIDDLE-AGE ENTHUSIASMS
To M. H.


      WE passed where flag and flower
      Signalled a jocund throng;
      We said: "Go to, the hour
      Is apt!" -- and joined the song;
   And, kindling, laughed at life and care,
   Although we knew no laugh lay there.

      We walked where shy birds stood
      Watching us, wonder-dumb;
      Their friendship met our mood;
      We cried: "We'll often come:
   We'll come morn, noon, eve, everywhen!"
   -- We doubted we should come again.

      We joyed to see strange sheens
      Leap from quaint leaves in shade;
      A secret light of greens
      They'd for their pleasure made.
   We said: "We'll set such sorts as these!"
   -- We knew with night the wish would cease.

      "So sweet the place," we said,
      "Its tacit tales so dear,
      Our thoughts, when breath has sped,
      Will meet and mingle here!" . . .
   "Words!" mused we.  "Passed the mortal door,
   Our thoughts will reach this nook no more."




IN A WOOD
See "THE WOODLANDERS"


   PALE beech and pine-tree blue,
      Set in one clay,
   Bough to bough cannot you
      Bide out your day?
   When the rains skim and skip,
   Why mar sweet comradeship,
   Blighting with poison-drip
      Neighbourly spray?

   Heart-halt and spirit-lame,
      City-opprest,
   Unto this wood I came
      As to a nest;
   Dreaming that sylvan peace
   Offered the harrowed ease -- 
   Nature a soft release
      From men's unrest.

   But, having entered in,
      Great growths and small
   Show them to men akin -- 
      Combatants all!
   Sycamore shoulders oak,
   Bines the slim sapling yoke,
   Ivy-spun halters choke
      Elms stout and tall.

   Touches from ash, O wych,
      Sting you like scorn!
   You, too, brave hollies, twitch
      Sidelong from thorn.
   Even the rank poplars bear
   Illy a rival's air,
   Cankering in black despair
      If overborne.

   Since, then, no grace I find
      Taught me of trees,
   Turn I back to my kind,
      Worthy as these.
   There at least smiles abound,
   There discourse trills around,
   There, now and then, are found
      Life-loyalties.





TO A LADY
OFFENDED BY A BOOK OF THE WRITER'S


   NOW that my page upcloses, doomed, maybe,
   Never to press thy cosy cushions more,
   Or wake thy ready Yeas as heretofore,
   Or stir thy gentle vows of faith in me:

   Knowing thy natural receptivity,
   I figure that, as flambeaux banish eve,
   My sombre image, warped by insidious heave
   Of those less forthright, must lose place in thee.

   So be it.  I have borne such.  Let thy dreams
   Of me and mine diminish day by day,
   And yield their space to shine of smugger things;
   Till I shape to thee but in fitful gleams,
   And then in far and feeble visitings,
   And then surcease.  Truth will be truth alway.




TO AN ORPHAN CHILD
A WHIMSEY


   AH, child, thou art but half thy darling mother's;
      Hers couldst thou wholly be,
   My light in thee would outglow all in others;
      She would relive to me.
   But niggard Nature's trick of birth
      Bars, lest she overjoy,
   Renewal of the loved on earth
         Save with alloy.

   The Dame has no regard, alas, my maiden,
      For love and loss like mine -- 
   No sympathy with mind-sight memory-laden;
      Only with fickle eyne.
   To her mechanic artistry
      My dreams are all unknown,
   And why I wish that thou couldst be
         But One's alone!

                    



NATURE'S QUESTIONING


      WHEN I look forth at dawning, pool,
         Field, flock, and lonely tree,
         All seem to gaze at me
   Like chastened children sitting silent in a school;

      Their faces dulled, constrained, and worn,
         As though the master's ways
         Through the long teaching days
   Their first terrestrial zest had chilled and overborne.

      And on them stirs, in lippings mere
         (As if once clear in call,
         But now scarce breathed at all) -- 
   "We wonder, ever wonder, why we find us here!

      "Has some Vast Imbecility,
         Mighty to build and blend,
         But impotent to tend,
   Framed us in jest, and left us now to hazardry?

      "Or come we of an Automaton
         Unconscious of our pains? . . .
         Or are we live remains
   Of Godhead dying downwards, brain and eye now gone?

      "Or is it that some high Plan betides,
         As yet not understood,
         Of Evil stormed by Good,
   We the Forlorn Hope over which Achievement strides?"

      Thus things around.  No answerer I . . .
         Meanwhile the winds, and rains,
         And Earth's old glooms and pains
   Are still the same, and gladdest Life Death neighbours nigh.




THE IMPERCIPIENT
(AT A CATHEDRAL SERVICE)


   THAT from this bright believing band
      An outcast I should be,
   That faiths by which my comrades stand
      Seem fantasies to me,
   And mirage-mists their Shining Land,
      Is a drear destiny.

   Why thus my soul should be consigned
      To infelicity,
   Why always I must feel as blind
      To sights my brethren see,
   Why joys they've found I cannot find,
      Abides a mystery.

   Since heart of mine knows not that ease
      Which they know; since it be
   That He who breathes All's Well to these
      Breathes no All's-Well to me,
   My lack might move their sympathies
      And Christian charity!

   I am like a gazer who should mark
      An inland company
   Standing upfingered, with, "Hark! hark!
      The glorious distant sea!"
   And feel, "Alas, 'tis but yon dark
      And wind-swept pine to me!"

   Yet I would bear my shortcomings
      With meet tranquillity,
   But for the charge that blessed things
      I'd liefer have unbe.
   O, doth a bird deprived of wings
      Go earth-bound wilfully!

                                    

   Enough.  As yet disquiet clings
      About us.  Rest shall we.

                 


AT AN INN


   WHEN we as strangers sought
      Their catering care,
   Veiled smiles bespoke their thought
      Of what we were.
   They warmed as they opined
      Us more than friends -- 
   That we had all resigned
      For love's dear ends.

   And that swift sympathy
      With living love
   Which quicks the world -- maybe
      The spheres above,
   Made them our ministers,
      Moved them to say,
   "Ah, God, that bliss like theirs
      Would flush our day!"

   And we were left alone
      As Love's own pair;
   Yet never the love-light shone
      Between us there!
   But that which chilled the breath
      Of afternoon,
   And palsied unto death
      The pane-fly's tune.

   The kiss their zeal foretold,
      And now deemed come,
   Came not: within his hold
      Love lingered-numb.
   Why cast he on our port
      A bloom not ours?
   Why shaped us for his sport
      In after-hours?

   As we seemed we were not
      That day afar,
   And now we seem not what
      We aching are.
   O severing sea and land,
      O laws of men,
   Ere death, once let us stand
      As we stood then!




THE SLOW NATURE
(AN INCIDENT OF FROOM VALLEY)


   "THY husband -- poor, poor Heart! -- is dead -- 
      Dead, out by Moreford Rise;
   A bull escaped the barton-shed,
      Gored him, and there he lies!"

   -- "Ha, ha -- go away!  'Tis a tale, methink,
      Thou joker Kit!" laughed she.
   "I've known thee many a year, Kit Twink,
      And ever hast thou fooled me!"

   -- "But, Mistress Damon -- I can swear
      Thy goodman John is dead!
   And soon th'lt hear their feet who bear
      His body to his bed."

   So unwontedly sad was the merry man's face -- 
      That face which had long deceived -- 
   That she gazed and gazed; and then could trace
      The truth there; and she believed.

   She laid a hand on the dresser-ledge,
      And scanned far Egdon-side;
   And stood; and you heard the wind-swept sedge
      And the rippling Froom; till she cried:

   "O my chamber's untidied, unmade my bed
      Though the day has begun to wear!
  `What a slovenly hussif!` it will be said,
      When they all go up my stair!"

   She disappeared; and the joker stood
      Depressed by his neighbour's doom,
   And amazed that a wife struck to widowhood
      Thought first of her unkempt room.

   But a fortnight thence she could take no food,
      And she pined in a slow decay;
   While Kit soon lost his mournful mood
      And laughed in his ancient way.





IN A EWELEAZE NEAR WEATHERBURY


   THE years have gathered grayly
      Since I danced upon this leaze
   With one who kindled gaily
      Love's fitful ecstasies!
   But despite the term as teacher,
      I remain what I was then
   In each essential feature
      Of the fantasies of men.

   Yet I note the little chisel
      Of never-napping Time,
   Defacing ghast and grizzel
      The blazon of my prime.
   When at night he thinks me sleeping,
      I feel him boring sly
   Within my bones, and heaping
      Quaintest pains for by-and-by.

   Still, I'd go the world with Beauty,
      I would laugh with her and sing,
   I would shun divinest duty
      To resume her worshipping.
   But she'd scorn my brave endeavour,
      She would not balm the breeze
   By murmuring "Thine for ever!"
      As she did upon this leaze.


      



ADDITIONS


THE FIRE AT TRANTER SWEATLEY'S


   THEY had long met o' Zundays -- her true love and she -- 
      And at junketings, maypoles, and flings;
   But she bode wi' a thirtover uncle, and he
   Swore by noon and by night that her goodman should be
   Naibour Sweatley -- a gaffer oft weak at the knee
   From taking o' sommat more cheerful than tea -- 
      Who tranted, and moved people's things.

   She cried, "O pray pity me!"  Nought would he hear;
      Then with wild rainy eyes she obeyed.
   She chid when her Love was for clinking off wi' her.
   The pa'son was told, as the season drew near
   To throw over pu'pit the names of the pe ir
      As fitting one flesh to be made.

   The wedding-day dawned and the morning drew on;
      The couple stood bridegroom and bride;
   The evening was passed, and when midnight had gone
   The folks horned out, "God save the King," and anon
      The two home-along gloomily hied.

   The lover Tim Tankens mourned heart-sick and drear
      To be thus of his darling deprived:
   He roamed in the dark ath'art field, mound, and mere,
   And, a'most without knowing it, found himself near
   The house of the tranter, and now of his Dear,
      Where the lantern-light showed 'em arrived.

   The bride sought her cham'er so calm and so pale
      That a Northern had thought her resigned;
   But to eyes that had seen her in tide-times of weal,
   Like the white cloud o' smoke, the red battle-field's vail,
      That look spak' of havoc behind.

   The bridegroom yet laitered a beaker to drain,
      Then reeled to the linhay for more,
   When the candle-snoff kindled some chaff from his grain -- 
   Flames spread, and red vlankers, wi' might and wi' main,
      And round beams, thatch, and chimley-tun roar.

   Young Tim away yond, rafted up by the light,
      Through brimble and underwood tears,
   Till he comes to the orchet, when crooping thereright
   In the lewth of a codlin-tree, bivering wi' fright,
   Wi' on'y her night-rail to screen her from sight,
      His lonesome young Barbree appears.

   Her cwold little figure half-naked he views
      Played about by the frolicsome breeze,
   Her light-tripping totties, her ten little tooes,
   All bare and besprinkled wi' Fall's chilly dews,
   While her great gallied eyes, through her hair hanging loose,
      Sheened as stars through a tardle o' trees.

   She eyed en; and, as when a weir-hatch is drawn,
      Her tears, penned by terror afore,
   With a rushing of sobs in a shower were strawn,
   Till her power to pour 'em seemed wasted and gone
      From the heft o' misfortune she bore.

   "O Tim, my own Tim I must call 'ee -- I will!
      All the world ha' turned round on me so!
   Can you help her who loved 'ee, though acting so ill?
   Can you pity her misery -- feel for her still?
   When worse than her body so quivering and chill
      Is her heart in its winter o' woe!

   "I think I mid almost ha' borne it," she said,
      "Had my griefs one by one come to hand;
   But O, to be slave to thik husbird for bread,
   And then, upon top o' that, driven to wed,
   And then, upon top o' that, burnt out o' bed,
      Is more than my nater can stand!"

   Tim's soul like a lion 'ithin en outsprung -- 
   (Tim had a great soul when his feelings were wrung) -- 
      "Feel for 'ee, dear Barbree?" he cried;
   And his warm working-jacket about her he flung,
   Made a back, horsed her up, till behind him she clung
   Like a chiel on a gipsy, her figure uphung
      By the sleeves that around her he tied.

   Over piggeries, and mixens, and apples, and hay,
      They lumpered straight into the night;
   And finding bylong where a halter-path lay,
   At dawn reached Tim's house, on'y seen on their way
   By a naibour or two who were up wi' the day;
      But they gathered no clue to the sight.

   Then tender Tim Tankens he searched here and there
      For some garment to clothe her fair skin;
   But though he had breeches and waistcoats to spare,
   He had nothing quite seemly for Barbree to wear,
   Who, half shrammed to death, stood and cried on a chair
      At the caddle she found herself in.

   There was one thing to do, and that one thing he did,
      He lent her some clouts of his own,
   And she took 'em perforce; and while in 'em she slid,
   Tim turned to the winder, as modesty bid,
   Thinking, "O that the picter my duty keeps hid
      To the sight o' my eyes mid be shown!"

   In the tallet he stowed her; there huddied she lay,
      Shortening sleeves, legs, and tails to her limbs;
   But most o' the time in a mortal bad way,
   Well knowing that there'd be the divel to pay
   If 'twere found that, instead o' the elements' prey,
      She was living in lodgings at Tim's.

   "Where's the tranter?" said men and boys; "where can er be?"
      "Where's the tranter?" said Barbree alone.
   "Where on e'th is the tranter?" said everybod-y:
   They sifted the dust of his perished roof-tree,
      And all they could find was a bone.

   Then the uncle cried, "Lord, pray have mercy on me!"
      And in terror began to repent.
   But before 'twas complete, and till sure she was free,
   Barbree drew up her loft-ladder, tight turned her key -- 
   Tim bringing up breakfast and dinner and tea -- 
      Till the news of her hiding got vent.

   Then followed the custom-kept rout, shout, and flare
   Of a skimmington-ride through the naibourhood, ere
      Folk had proof o' wold Sweatley's decay.
   Whereupon decent people all stood in a stare,
   Saying Tim and his lodger should risk it, and pair:
   So he took her to church.  An' some laughing lads there
   Cried to Tim, "After Sweatley!"  She said, "I declare
      I stand as a maiden to-day!"




HEIRESS AND ARCHITECT
FOR A. W. B.


   SHE sought the Studios, beckoning to her side
   An arch-designer, for she planned to build.
   He was of wise contrivance, deeply skilled
   In every intervolve of high and wide -- 
      Well fit to be her guide.

         "Whatever it be,"
         Responded he,
   With cold, clear voice, and cold, clear view,
   "In true accord with prudent fashionings
   For such vicissitudes as living brings,
   And thwarting not the law of stable things,
      That will I do."

   "Shape me," she said, "high halls with tracery
   And open ogive-work, that scent and hue
   Of buds, and travelling bees, may come in through,
   The note of birds, and singings of the sea,
      For these are much to me."

      "An idle whim!"
      Broke forth from him
   Whom nought could warm to gallantries:
   "Cede all these buds and birds, the zephyr's call,
   And scents, and hues, and things that falter all,
   And choose as best the close and surly wall,
      For winters freeze."

     
   "Then frame," she cried, "wide fronts of crystal glass,
   That I may show my laughter and my light -- 
   Light like the sun's by day, the stars' by night -- 
   Till rival heart-queens, envying, wail,`Alas,
      Her glory!` as they pass."

      "O maid misled!"
      He sternly said,
   Whose facile foresight pierced her dire;
   "Where shall abide the soul when, sick of glee,
   It shrinks, and hides, and prays no eye may see?
   Those house them best who house for secrecy,
      For you will tire."

   "A little chamber, then, with swan and dove
   Ranged thickly, and engrailed with rare device
   Of reds and purples, for a Paradise
   Wherein my Love may greet me, I my Love,
      When he shall know thereof?"

      "This, too, is ill,"
      He answered still,
   The man who swayed her like a shade.
   "An hour will come when sight of such sweet nook
   Would bring a bitterness too sharp to brook,
   When brighter eyes have won away his look;
      For you will fade."

   Then said she faintly: "O, contrive some way -- 
   Some narrow winding turret, quite mine own,
   To reach a loft where I may grieve alone!
   It is a slight thing; hence do not, I pray,
      This last dear fancy slay!"

      "Such winding ways
      Fit not your days,"
   Said he, the man of measuring eye;
   "I must even fashion as my rule declares,
   To wit: Give space (since life ends unawares)
   To hale a coffined corpse adown the stairs;
      For you will die."




THE TWO MEN


   THERE were two youths of equal age,
   Wit, station, strength, and parentage;
   They studied at the selfsame schools,
   And shaped their thoughts by common rules.

   One pondered on the life of man,
   His hopes, his ending, and began
   To rate the Market's sordid war
   As something scarce worth living for.

   "I'll brace to higher aims," said he,
   "I'll further Truth and Purity;
   Thereby to mend the mortal lot
   And sweeten sorrow.  Thrive I not,

   "Winning their hearts, my kind will give
   Enough that I may lowly live,
   And house my Love in some dim dell,
   For pleasing them and theirs so well."

   Idly attired, with features wan,
   In secret swift he laboured on:
   Such press of power had brought much gold
   Applied to things of meaner mould.

   Sometimes he wished his aims had been
   To gather gains like other men;
   Then thanked his God he'd traced his track
   Too far for wish to drag him back.

   He look d from his loft one day
   To where his slighted garden lay;
   Nettles and hemlock hid each lawn,
   And every flower was starved and gone.

   He fainted in his heart, whereon
   He rose, and sought his plighted one,
   Resolved to loose her bond withal,
   Lest she should perish in his fall.

   He met her with a careless air,
   As though he'd ceased to find her fair,
   And said: "True love is dust to me;
   I cannot kiss: I tire of thee!"

   (That she might scorn him was he fain,
   To put her sooner out of pain;
   For incensed love breathes quick and dies,
   When famished love a-lingering lies.)

   Once done, his soul was so betossed,
   It found no more the force it lost:
   Hope was his only drink and food,
   And hope extinct, decay ensued.

   And, living long so closely penned,
   He had not kept a single friend;
   He dwindled thin as phantoms be,
   And drooped to death in poverty . . .

   Meantime his schoolmate had gone out
   To join the fortune-finding rout;
   He liked the winnings of the mart,
   But wearied of the working part.

   He turned to seek a privy lair,
   Neglecting note of garb and hair,
   And day by day reclined and thought
   How he might live by doing nought.

   "I plan a valued scheme," he said
   To some.  "But lend me of your bread,
   And when the vast result looms nigh,
   In profit you shall stand as I."

   Yet they took counsel to restrain
   Their kindness till they saw the gain;
   And, since his substance now had run,
   He rose to do what might be done.

   He went unto his Love by night,
   And said: "My Love, I faint in fight:
   Deserving as thou dost a crown,
   My cares shall never drag thee down."

   (He had descried a maid whose line
   Would hand her on much corn and wine,
   And held her far in worth above
   One who could only pray and love.)

   But this Fair read him; whence he failed
   To do the deed so blithely hailed;
   He saw his projects wholly marred,
   And gloom and want oppressed him hard;

   Till, living to so mean an end,
   Whereby he'd lost his every friend,
   He perished in a pauper sty,
   His mate the dying pauper nigh.

   And moralists, reflecting, said,
   As "dust to dust" in burial read
   Was echoed from each coffin-lid,
   "These men were like in all they did."




LINES


   BEFORE we part to alien thoughts and aims,
   Permit the one brief word the occasion claims:
   -- When mumming and grave projects are allied,
   Perhaps an Epilogue is justified.

   Our under-purpose has, in truth, to-day
   Commanded most our musings; least the play:
   A purpose futile but for your good-will
   Swiftly responsive to the cry of ill:
   A purpose all too limited! -- to aid
   Frail human flowerets, sicklied by the shade,
   In winning some short spell of upland breeze,
   Or strengthening sunlight on the level leas.

   Who has not marked, where the full cheek should be,
   Incipient lines of lank flaccidity,
   Lymphatic pallor where the pink should glow,
   And where the throb of transport, pulses low? -- 
   Most tragical of shapes from Pole to Line,
   O wondering child, unwitting Time's design,
   Why should Art add to Nature's quandary,
   And worsen ill by thus immuring thee?
   -- That races do despite unto their own,
   That Might supernal do indeed condone
   Wrongs individual for the general ease,
   Instance the proof in victims such as these.

   Launched into thoroughfares too thronged before,
   Mothered by those whose protest is "No more!"
   Vitalized without option: who shall say
   That did Life hang on choosing -- Yea or Nay -- 
   They had not scorned it with such penalty,
   And nothingness implored of Destiny?

   And yet behind the horizon smile serene
   The down, the cornland, and the stretching green -- 
   Space -- the child's heaven: scenes which at least ensure
   Some palliative for ill they cannot cure.

   Dear friends -- now moved by this poor show of ours
   To make your own long joy in buds and bowers
   For one brief while the joy of infant eyes,
   Changing their urban murk to paradise -- 
   You have our thanks! -- may your reward include
   More than our thanks, far more: their gratitude.



"I LOOK INTO MY GLASS"


   I LOOK into my glass,
   And view my wasting skin,
   And say, "Would God it came to pass
   My heart had shrunk as thin!"

   For then, I, undistrest
   By hearts grown cold to me,
   Could lonely wait my endless rest
   With equanimity.

   But Time, to make me grieve;
   Part steals, lets part abide;
   And shakes this fragile frame at eve
   With throbbings of noontide.

Responsibilities and other poems
W.B. Yeats

RESPONSIBILITIES

  _Pardon, old fathers, if you still remain_
  _Somewhere in ear-shot for the story's end,_
  _Old Dublin merchant `free of ten and four`_
  _Or trading out of Galway into Spain;_
  _And country scholar, Robert Emmet's friend,_
  _A hundred-year-old memory to the poor;_
  _Traders or soldiers who have left me blood_
  _That has not passed through any huxter's loin,_
  _Pardon, and you that did not weigh the cost,_
  _Old Butlers when you took to horse and stood_
  _Beside the brackish waters of the Boyne_
  _Till your bad master blenched and all was lost;_
  _You merchant skipper that leaped overboard_
  _After a ragged hat in Biscay Bay,_
  _You most of all, silent and fierce old man_
  _Because you were the spectacle that stirred_
  _My fancy, and set my boyish lips to say_
  _`Only the wasteful virtues earn the sun`;_
  _Pardon that for a barren passion's sake,_
  _Although I have come close on forty-nine_
  _I have no child, I have nothing but a book,_
  _Nothing but that to prove your blood and mine._


THE GREY ROCK


  _Poets with whom I learned my trade,_
  _Companions of the Cheshire Cheese,_
  _Here's an old story I've re-made,_
  _Imagining 'twould better please_
  _Your ears than stories now in fashion,_
  _Though you may think I waste my breath_
  _Pretending that there can be passion_
  _That has more life in it than death,_
  _And though at bottling of your wine_
  _The bow-legged Goban had no say;_
  _The moral's yours because it's mine._

  When cups went round at close of day -- 
  Is not that how good stories run? -- 
  Somewhere within some hollow hill,
  If books speak truth in Slievenamon,
  But let that be, the gods were still
  And sleepy, having had their meal,
  And smoky torches made a glare
  On painted pillars, on a deal
  Of fiddles and of flutes hung there
  By the ancient holy hands that brought them
  From murmuring Murias, on cups -- 
  Old Goban hammered them and wrought them,
  And put his pattern round their tops
  To hold the wine they buy of him.
  But from the juice that made them wise
  All those had lifted up the dim
  Imaginations of their eyes,
  For one that was like woman made
  Before their sleepy eyelids ran
  And trembling with her passion said,
  `Come out and dig for a dead man,
  Who's burrowing somewhere in the ground,
  And mock him to his face and then
  Hollo him on with horse and hound,
  For he is the worst of all dead men.`

  _We should be dazed and terror struck,_
  _If we but saw in dreams that room,_
  _Those wine-drenched eyes, and curse our luck_
  _That emptied all our days to come._
  _I knew a woman none could please,_
  _Because she dreamed when but a child_
  _Of men and women made like these;_
  _And after, when her blood ran wild,_
  _Had ravelled her own story out,_
  _And said, `In two or in three years_
  _I need must marry some poor lout,`_
  _And having said it burst in tears._
  _Since, tavern comrades, you have died,_
  _Maybe your images have stood,_
  _Mere bone and muscle thrown aside,_
  _Before that roomful or as good._
  _You had to face your ends when young -- _
  _'Twas wine or women, or some curse -- _
  _But never made a poorer song_
  _That you might have a heavier purse,_
  _Nor gave loud service to a cause_
  _That you might have a troop of friends._
  _You kept the Muses' sterner laws,_
  _And unrepenting faced your ends,_
  _And therefore earned the right -- and yet_
  _Dowson and Johnson most I praise -- _
  _To troop with those the world's forgot,_
  _And copy their proud steady gaze._

  `The Danish troop was driven out
  Between the dawn and dusk,` she said;
  `Although the event was long in doubt,
  Although the King of Ireland's dead
  And half the kings, before sundown
  All was accomplished.`

                        `When this day
  Murrough, the King of Ireland's son,
  Foot after foot was giving way,
  He and his best troops back to back
  Had perished there, but the Danes ran,
  Stricken with panic from the attack,
  The shouting of an unseen man;
  And being thankful Murrough found,
  Led by a footsole dipped in blood
  That had made prints upon the ground,
  Where by old thorn trees that man stood;
  And though when he gazed here and there,
  He had but gazed on thorn trees, spoke,
  Who is the friend that seems but air
  And yet could give so fine a stroke?
  Thereon a young man met his eye,
  Who said, Because she held me in
  Her love, and would not have me die,
  Rock-nurtured Aoife took a pin,
  And pushing it into my shirt,
  Promised that for a pin's sake,
  No man should see to do me hurt;
  But there it's gone; I will not take
  The fortune that had been my shame
  Seeing, King's son, what wounds you have.
  'Twas roundly spoke, but when night came
  He had betrayed me to his grave,
  For he and the King's son were dead.
  I'd promised him two hundred years,
  And when for all I'd done or said -- 
  And these immortal eyes shed tears -- 
  He claimed his country's need was most,
  I'd save his life, yet for the sake
  Of a new friend he has turned a ghost.
  What does he care if my heart break?
  I call for spade and horse and hound
  That we may harry him.` Thereon
  She cast herself upon the ground
  And rent her clothes and made her moan:
  `Why are they faithless when their might
  Is from the holy shades that rove
  The grey rock and the windy light?
  Why should the faithfullest heart most love
  The bitter sweetness of false faces?
  Why must the lasting love what passes,
  Why are the gods by men betrayed!`

  But thereon every god stood up
  With a slow smile and without sound,
  And stretching forth his arm and cup
  To where she moaned upon the ground,
  Suddenly drenched her to the skin;
  And she with Goban's wine adrip,
  No more remembering what had been,
  Stared at the gods with laughing lip.

  _I have kept my faith, though faith was tried,_
  _To that rock-born, rock-wandering foot,_
  _And the world's altered since you died,_
  _And I am in no good repute_
  _With the loud host before the sea,_
  _That think sword strokes were better meant_
  _Than lover's music -- let that be,_
  _So that the wandering foot's content._




THE TWO KINGS


  King Eochaid came at sundown to a wood
  Westward of Tara. Hurrying to his queen
  He had out-ridden his war-wasted men
  That with empounded cattle trod the mire;
  And where beech trees had mixed a pale green light
  With the ground-ivy's blue, he saw a stag
  Whiter than curds, its eyes the tint of the sea.
  Because it stood upon his path and seemed
  More hands in height than any stag in the world
  He sat with tightened rein and loosened mouth
  Upon his trembling horse, then drove the spur;
  But the stag stooped and ran at him, and passed,
  Rending the horse's flank. King Eochaid reeled
  Then drew his sword to hold its levelled point
  Against the stag. When horn and steel were met
  The horn resounded as though it had been silver,
  A sweet, miraculous, terrifying sound.
  Horn locked in sword, they tugged and struggled there
  As though a stag and unicorn were met
  In Africa on Mountain of the Moon,
  Until at last the double horns, drawn backward,
  Butted below the single and so pierced
  The entrails of the horse. Dropping his sword
  King Eochaid seized the horns in his strong hands
  And stared into the sea-green eye, and so
  Hither and thither to and fro they trod
  Till all the place was beaten into mire.
  The strong thigh and the agile thigh were met,
  The hands that gathered up the might of the world,
  And hoof and horn that had sucked in their speed
  Amid the elaborate wilderness of the air.
  Through bush they plunged and over ivied root,
  And where the stone struck fire, while in the leaves
  A squirrel whinnied and a bird screamed out;
  But when at last he forced those sinewy flanks
  Against a beech bole, he threw down the beast
  And knelt above it with drawn knife. On the instant
  It vanished like a shadow, and a cry
  So mournful that it seemed the cry of one
  Who had lost some unimaginable treasure
  Wandered between the blue and the green leaf
  And climbed into the air, crumbling away,
  Till all had seemed a shadow or a vision
  But for the trodden mire, the pool of blood,
  The disembowelled horse.

                    King Eochaid ran,
  Toward peopled Tara, nor stood to draw his breath
  Until he came before the painted wall,
  The posts of polished yew, circled with bronze,
  Of the great door; but though the hanging lamps
  Showed their faint light through the unshuttered windows,
  Nor door, nor mouth, nor slipper made a noise,
  Nor on the ancient beaten paths, that wound
  From well-side or from plough-land, was there noise;
  And there had been no sound of living thing
  Before him or behind, but that far-off
  On the horizon edge bellowed the herds.
  Knowing that silence brings no good to kings,
  And mocks returning victory, he passed
  Between the pillars with a beating heart
  And saw where in the midst of the great hall
  Pale-faced, alone upon a bench, Edain
  Sat upright with a sword before her feet.
  Her hands on either side had gripped the bench,
  Her eyes were cold and steady, her lips tight.
  Some passion had made her stone. Hearing a foot
  She started and then knew whose foot it was;
  But when he thought to take her in his arms
  She motioned him afar, and rose and spoke:
  `I have sent among the fields or to the woods
  The fighting men and servants of this house,
  For I would have your judgment upon one
  Who is self-accused. If she be innocent
  She would not look in any known man's face
  Till judgment has been given, and if guilty,
  Will never look again on known man's face.`
  And at these words he paled, as she had paled,
  Knowing that he should find upon her lips
  The meaning of that monstrous day.

                                     Then she:
  `You brought me where your brother Ardan sat
  Always in his one seat, and bid me care him
  Through that strange illness that had fixed him there,
  And should he die to heap his burial mound
  And carve his name in Ogham.` Eochaid said,
  `He lives?` `He lives and is a healthy man.`
  `While I have him and you it matters little
  What man you have lost, what evil you have found.`
  `I bid them make his bed under this roof
  And carried him his food with my own hands,
  And so the weeks passed by. But when I said
  What is this trouble? he would answer nothing,
  Though always at my words his trouble grew;
  And I but asked the more, till he cried out,
  Weary of many questions: There are things
  That make the heart akin to the dumb stone.
  Then I replied: Although you hide a secret,
  Hopeless and dear, or terrible to think on,
  Speak it, that I may send through the wide world
  For medicine. Thereon he cried aloud:
  Day after day you question me, and I,
  Because there is such a storm amid my thoughts
  I shall be carried in the gust, command,
  Forbid, beseech and waste my breath. Then I,
  Although the thing that you have hid were evil,
  The speaking of it could be no great wrong,
  And evil must it be, if done 'twere worse
  Than mound and stone that keep all virtue in,
  And loosen on us dreams that waste our life,
  Shadows and shows that can but turn the brain.
  But finding him still silent I stooped down
  And whispering that none but he should hear,
  Said: If a woman has put this on you,
  My men, whether it please her or displease,
  And though they have to cross the Loughlan waters
  And take her in the middle of armed men,
  Shall make her look upon her handiwork,
  That she may quench the rick she has fired; and though
  She may have worn silk clothes, or worn a crown,
  She'll not be proud, knowing within her heart
  That our sufficient portion of the world
  Is that we give, although it be brief giving,
  Happiness to children and to men.
  Then he, driven by his thought beyond his thought,
  And speaking what he would not though he would,
  Sighed: You, even you yourself, could work the cure!
  And at those words I rose and I went out
  And for nine days he had food from other hands,
  And for nine days my mind went whirling round
  The one disastrous zodiac, muttering
  That the immedicable mound's beyond
  Our questioning, beyond our pity even.
  But when nine days had gone I stood again
  Before his chair and bending down my head
  Told him, that when Orion rose, and all
  The women of his household were asleep,
  To go -- for hope would give his limbs the power -- 
  To an old empty woodman's house that's hidden
  Close to a clump of beech trees in the wood
  Westward of Tara, there to await a friend
  That could, as he had told her, work his cure
  And would be no harsh friend.

                         When night had deepened,
  I groped my way through boughs, and over roots,
  Till oak and hazel ceased and beech began,
  And found the house, a sputtering torch within,
  And stretched out sleeping on a pile of skins
  Ardan, and though I called to him and tried
  To shake him out of sleep, I could not rouse him.
  I waited till the night was on the turn,
  Then fearing that some labourer, on his way
  To plough or pasture-land, might see me there,
  Went out.

            Among the ivy-covered rocks,
  As on the blue light of a sword, a man
  Who had unnatural majesty, and eyes
  Like the eyes of some great kite scouring the woods,
  Stood on my path. Trembling from head to foot
  I gazed at him like grouse upon a kite;
  But with a voice that had unnatural music,
  A weary wooing and a long, he said,
  Speaking of love through other lips and looking
  Under the eyelids of another, for it was my craft
  That put a passion in the sleeper there,
  And when I had got my will and drawn you here,
  Where I may speak to you alone, my craft
  Sucked up the passion out of him again
  And left mere sleep. He'll wake when the sun wakes,
  Push out his vigorous limbs and rub his eyes,
  And wonder what has ailed him these twelve months.
  I cowered back upon the wall in terror,
  But that sweet-sounding voice ran on: Woman,
  I was your husband when you rode the air,
  Danced in the whirling foam and in the dust,
  In days you have not kept in memory,
  Being betrayed into a cradle, and I come
  That I may claim you as my wife again.
  I was no longer terrified, his voice
  Had half awakened some old memory,
  Yet answered him: I am King Eochaid's wife
  And with him have found every happiness
  Women can find. With a most masterful voice,
  That made the body seem as it were a string
  Under a bow, he cried: What happiness
  Can lovers have that know their happiness
  Must end at the dumb stone? But where we build
  Our sudden palaces in the still air
  Pleasure itself can bring no weariness,
  Nor can time waste the cheek, nor is there foot
  That has grown weary of the whirling dance,
  Nor an unlaughing mouth, but mine that mourns,
  Among those mouths that sing their sweethearts' praise,
  Your empty bed. How should I love, I answered,
  Were it not that when the dawn has lit my bed
  And shown my husband sleeping there, I have sighed,
  `Your strength and nobleness will pass away.`
  Or how should love be worth its pains were it not
  That when he has fallen asleep within my arms,
  Being wearied out, I love in man the child?
  What can they know of love that do not know
  She builds her nest upon a narrow ledge
  Above a windy precipice? Then he:
  Seeing that when you come to the death-bed
  You must return, whether you would or no,
  This human life blotted from memory,
  Why must I live some thirty, forty years,
  Alone with all this useless happiness?
  Thereon he seized me in his arms, but I
  Thrust him away with both my hands and cried,
  Never will I believe there is any change
  Can blot out of my memory this life
  Sweetened by death, but if I could believe
  That were a double hunger in my lips
  For what is doubly brief.

                            And now the shape,
  My hands were pressed to, vanished suddenly.
  I staggered, but a beech tree stayed my fall,
  And clinging to it I could hear the cocks
  Crow upon Tara.`

                   King Eochaid bowed his head
  And thanked her for her kindness to his brother,
  For that she promised, and for that refused.

  Thereon the bellowing of the empounded herds
  Rose round the walls, and through the bronze-ringed door
  Jostled and shouted those war-wasted men,
  And in the midst King Eochaid's brother stood.
  He'd heard that din on the horizon's edge
  And ridden towards it, being ignorant.




TO A WEALTHY MAN WHO PROMISED A SECOND SUBSCRIPTION TO THE DUBLIN
MUNICIPAL GALLERY IF IT WERE PROVED THE PEOPLE WANTED PICTURES


  You gave but will not give again
  Until enough of Paudeen's pence
  By Biddy's halfpennies have lain
  To be `some sort of evidence,`
  Before you'll put your guineas down,
  That things it were a pride to give
  Are what the blind and ignorant town
  Imagines best to make it thrive.
  What cared Duke Ercole, that bid
  His mummers to the market place,
  What th' onion-sellers thought or did
  So that his Plautus set the pace
  For the Italian comedies?
  And Guidobaldo, when he made
  That grammar school of courtesies
  Where wit and beauty learned their trade
  Upon Urbino's windy hill,
  Had sent no runners to and fro
  That he might learn the shepherds' will.
  And when they drove out Cosimo,
  Indifferent how the rancour ran,
  He gave the hours they had set free
  To Michelozzo's latest plan
  For the San Marco Library,
  Whence turbulent Italy should draw
  Delight in Art whose end is peace,
  In logic and in natural law
  By sucking at the dugs of Greece.

  Your open hand but shows our loss,
  For he knew better how to live.
  Let Paudeens play at pitch and toss,
  Look up in the sun's eye and give
  What the exultant heart calls good
  That some new day may breed the best
  Because you gave, not what they would
  But the right twigs for an eagle's nest!




SEPTEMBER 1913


  What need you, being come to sense,
  But fumble in a greasy till
  And add the halfpence to the pence
  And prayer to shivering prayer, until
  You have dried the marrow from the bone;
  For men were born to pray and save:
  Romantic Ireland's dead and gone,
  It's with O'Leary in the grave.

  Yet they were of a different kind
  The names that stilled your childish play,
  They have gone about the world like wind,
  But little time had they to pray
  For whom the hangman's rope was spun,
  And what, God help us, could they save:
  Romantic Ireland's dead and gone,
  It's with O'Leary in the grave.

  Was it for this the wild geese spread
  The grey wing upon every tide;
  For this that all that blood was shed,
  For this Edward Fitzgerald died,
  And Robert Emmet and Wolfe Tone,
  All that delirium of the brave;
  Romantic Ireland's dead and gone,
  It's with O'Leary in the grave.

  Yet could we turn the years again,
  And call those exiles as they were,
  In all their loneliness and pain
  You'd cry `some woman's yellow hair
  Has maddened every mother's son`:
  They weighed so lightly what they gave,
  But let them be, they're dead and gone,
  They're with O'Leary in the grave.




TO A FRIEND WHOSE WORK HAS COME TO NOTHING


  Now all the truth is out,
  Be secret and take defeat
  From any brazen throat,
  For how can you compete,
  Being honour bred, with one
  Who, were it proved he lies,
  Were neither shamed in his own
  Nor in his neighbours' eyes?
  Bred to a harder thing
  Than Triumph, turn away
  And like a laughing string
  Whereon mad fingers play
  Amid a place of stone,
  Be secret and exult,
  Because of all things known
  That is most difficult.




PAUDEEN


  Indignant at the fumbling wits, the obscure spite
  Of our old Paudeen in his shop, I stumbled blind
  Among the stones and thorn trees, under morning light;
  Until a curlew cried and in the luminous wind
  A curlew answered; and suddenly thereupon I thought
  That on the lonely height where all are in God's eye,
  There cannot be, confusion of our sound forgot,
  A single soul that lacks a sweet crystaline cry.




TO A SHADE


  If you have revisited the town, thin Shade,
  Whether to look upon your monument
  (I wonder if the builder has been paid)
  Or happier thoughted when the day is spent
  To drink of that salt breath out of the sea
  When grey gulls flit about instead of men,
  And the gaunt houses put on majesty:
  Let these content you and be gone again;
  For they are at their old tricks yet.

                                        A man
  Of your own passionate serving kind who had brought
  In his full hands what, had they only known,
  Had given their children's children loftier thought,
  Sweeter emotion, working in their veins
  Like gentle blood, has been driven from the place,
  And insult heaped upon him for his pains
  And for his open-handedness, disgrace;
  An old foul mouth that slandered you had set
  The pack upon him.

                     Go, unquiet wanderer,
  And gather the Glasnevin coverlet
  About your head till the dust stops your ear,
  The time for you to taste of that salt breath
  And listen at the corners has not come;
  You had enough of sorrow before death -- 
  Away, away! You are safer in the tomb.





WHEN HELEN LIVED

  We have cried in our despair
  That men desert,
  For some trivial affair
  Or noisy, insolent sport,
  Beauty that we have won
  From bitterest hours;
  Yet we, had we walked within
  Those topless towers
  Where Helen walked with her boy,
  Had given but as the rest
  Of the men and women of Troy,
  A word and a jest.




THE ATTACK ON `THE PLAYBOY OF THE WESTERN WORLD,` 1907

  Once, when midnight smote the air,
  Eunuchs ran through Hell and met
  From thoroughfare to thoroughfare,
  While that great Juan galloped by;
  And like these to rail and sweat
  Staring upon his sinewy thigh.


THE THREE BEGGARS

  _`Though to my feathers in the wet,_
  _I have stood here from break of day,_
  _I have not found a thing to eat_
  _For only rubbish comes my way._
  _Am I to live on lebeen-lone?`_
  _Muttered the old crane of Gort._
  _`For all my pains on lebeen-lone.`_

  King Guari walked amid his court
  The palace-yard and river-side
  And there to three old beggars said:
  `You that have wandered far and wide
  Can ravel out what's in my head.
  Do men who least desire get most,
  Or get the most who most desire?`
  A beggar said: `They get the most
  Whom man or devil cannot tire,
  And what could make their muscles taut
  Unless desire had made them so.`
  But Guari laughed with secret thought,
  `If that be true as it seems true,
  One of you three is a rich man,
  For he shall have a thousand pounds
  Who is first asleep, if but he can
  Sleep before the third noon sounds.`
  And thereon merry as a bird,
  With his old thoughts King Guari went
  From river-side and palace-yard
  And left them to their argument.
  `And if I win,` one beggar said,
  `Though I am old I shall persuade
  A pretty girl to share my bed`;
  The second: `I shall learn a trade`;
  The third: `I'll hurry to the course
  Among the other gentlemen,
  And lay it all upon a horse`;
  The second: `I have thought again:
  A farmer has more dignity.`
  One to another sighed and cried:
  The exorbitant dreams of beggary,
  That idleness had borne to pride,
  Sang through their teeth from noon to noon;
  And when the second twilight brought
  The frenzy of the beggars' moon
  They closed their blood-shot eyes for naught.
  One beggar cried: `You're shamming sleep.`
  And thereupon their anger grew
  Till they were whirling in a heap.

  They'd mauled and bitten the night through
  Or sat upon their heels to rail,
  And when old Guari came and stood
  Before the three to end this tale,
  They were commingling lice and blood.
  `Time's up,` he cried, and all the three
  With blood-shot eyes upon him stared.
  `Time's up,` he cried, and all the three
  Fell down upon the dust and snored.

  _`Maybe I shall be lucky yet,_
  _Now they are silent,` said the crane._
  _`Though to my feathers in the wet_
  _I've stood as I were made of stone_
  _And seen the rubbish run about,_
  _It's certain there are trout somewhere_
  _And maybe I shall take a trout_
  _If but I do not seem to care.`_



THE THREE HERMITS

  Three old hermits took the air
  By a cold and desolate sea,
  First was muttering a prayer,
  Second rummaged for a flea;
  On a windy stone, the third,
  Giddy with his hundredth year,
  Sang unnoticed like a bird.
  `Though the Door of Death is near
  And what waits behind the door,
  Three times in a single day
  I, though upright on the shore,
  Fall asleep when I should pray.`
  So the first but now the second,
  `We're but given what we have earned
  When all thoughts and deeds are reckoned,
  So it's plain to be discerned
  That the shades of holy men,
  Who have failed being weak of will,
  Pass the Door of Birth again,
  And are plagued by crowds, until
  They've the passion to escape.`
  Moaned the other, `They are thrown
  Into some most fearful shape.`
  But the second mocked his moan:
  `They are not changed to anything,
  Having loved God once, but maybe,
  To a poet or a king
  Or a witty lovely lady.`
  While he'd rummaged rags and hair,
  Caught and cracked his flea, the third,
  Giddy with his hundredth year
  Sang unnoticed like a bird.



BEGGAR TO BEGGAR CRIED


  `Time to put off the world and go somewhere
  And find my health again in the sea air,`
  Beggar to beggar cried, being frenzy-struck,
  `And make my soul before my pate is bare.`

  `And get a comfortable wife and house
  To rid me of the devil in my shoes,`
  Beggar to beggar cried, being frenzy-struck,
  `And the worse devil that is between my thighs.`

  `And though I'd marry with a comely lass,
  She need not be too comely -- let it pass,`
  Beggar to beggar cried, being frenzy-struck,
  `But there's a devil in a looking-glass.`

  `Nor should she be too rich, because the rich
  Are driven by wealth as beggars by the itch,`
  Beggar to beggar cried, being frenzy-struck,
  `And cannot have a humorous happy speech.`

  `And there I'll grow respected at my ease,
  And hear amid the garden's nightly peace,`
  Beggar to beggar cried, being frenzy-struck,
  `The wind-blown clamor of the barnacle-geese.`




THE WELL AND THE TREE


  `The Man that I praise,`
  Cries out the empty well,
  `Lives all his days
  Where a hand on the bell
  Can call the milch-cows
  To the comfortable door of his house.
  Who but an idiot would praise
  Dry stones in a well?`

  `The Man that I praise,`
  Cries out the leafless tree,
  `Has married and stays
  By an old hearth, and he
  On naught has set store
  But children and dogs on the floor.
  Who but an idiot would praise
  A withered tree?`



RUNNING TO PARADISE

  As I came over Windy Gap
  They threw a halfpenny into my cap,
  For I am running to Paradise;
  And all that I need do is to wish
  And somebody puts his hand in the dish
  To throw me a bit of salted fish:
  And there the king _is_ but as the beggar.

  My brother Mourteen is worn out
  With skelping his big brawling lout,
  And I am running to Paradise;
  A poor life do what he can,
  And though he keep a dog and a gun,
  A serving maid and a serving man:
  And there the king _is_ but as the beggar.

  Poor men have grown to be rich men,
  And rich men grown to be poor again,
  And I am running to Paradise;
  And many a darling wit's grown dull
  That tossed a bare heel when at school,
  Now it has filled an old sock full:
  And there the king _is_ but as the beggar.

  The wind is old and still at play
  While I must hurry upon my way,
  For I am running to Paradise;
  Yet never have I lit on a friend
  To take my fancy like the wind
  That nobody can buy or bind:
  And there the king _is_ but as the beggar.



THE HOUR BEFORE DAWN


  A one-legged, one-armed, one-eyed man,
  A bundle of rags upon a crutch,
  Stumbled on windy Cruachan
  Cursing the wind. It was as much
  As the one sturdy leg could do
  To keep him upright while he cursed.
  He had counted, where long years ago
  Queen Maeve's nine Maines had been nursed,
  A pair of lapwings, one old sheep
  And not a house to the plain's edge,
  When close to his right hand a heap
  Of grey stones and a rocky ledge
  Reminded him that he could make,
  If he but shifted a few stones,
  A shelter till the daylight broke.
  But while he fumbled with the stones
  They toppled over; `Were it not
  I have a lucky wooden shin
  I had been hurt`; and toppling brought
  Before his eyes, where stones had been,
  A dark deep hole in the rock's face.
  He gave a gasp and thought to run,
  Being certain it was no right place
  But the Hell Mouth at Cruachan
  That's stuffed with all that's old and bad,
  And yet stood still, because inside
  He had seen a red-haired jolly lad
  In some outlandish coat beside
  A ladle and a tub of beer,
  Plainly no phantom by his look.
  So with a laugh at his own fear
  He crawled into that pleasant nook.
  Young Red-head stretched himself to yawn
  And murmured, `May God curse the night
  That's grown uneasy near the dawn
  So that it seems even I sleep light;
  And who are you that wakens me?
  Has one of Maeve's nine brawling sons
  Grown tired of his own company?
  But let him keep his grave for once
  I have to find the sleep I have lost.`
  And then at last being wide awake,
  `I took you for a brawling ghost,
  Say what you please, but from day-break
  I'll sleep another century.`
  The beggar deaf to all but hope
  Went down upon a hand and knee
  And took the wooden ladle up
  And would have dipped it in the beer
  But the other pushed his hand aside,
  `Before you have dipped it in the beer
  That sacred Goban brewed,` he cried,
  `I'd have assurance that you are able
  To value beer -- I will have no fool
  Dipping his nose into my ladle
  Because he has stumbled on this hole
  In the bad hour before the dawn.
  If you but drink that beer and say
  I will sleep until the winter's gone,
  Or maybe, to Midsummer Day
  You will sleep that length; and at the first
  I waited so for that or this -- 
  Because the weather was a-cursed
  Or I had no woman there to kiss,
  And slept for half a year or so;
  But year by year I found that less
  Gave me such pleasure I'd forgo
  Even a half hour's nothingness,
  And when at one year's end I found
  I had not waked a single minute,
  I chose this burrow under ground.
  I will sleep away all Time within it:
  My sleep were now nine centuries
  But for those mornings when I find
  The lapwing at their foolish cries
  And the sheep bleating at the wind
  As when I also played the fool.`
  The beggar in a rage began
  Upon his hunkers in the hole,
  `It's plain that you are no right man
  To mock at everything I love
  As if it were not worth the doing.
  I'd have a merry life enough
  If a good Easter wind were blowing,
  And though the winter wind is bad
  I should not be too down in the mouth
  For anything you did or said
  If but this wind were in the south.`
  But the other cried, `You long for spring
  Or that the wind would shift a point
  And do not know that you would bring,
  If time were suppler in the joint,
  Neither the spring nor the south wind
  But the hour when you shall pass away
  And leave no smoking wick behind,
  For all life longs for the Last Day
  And there's no man but cocks his ear
  To know when Michael's trumpet cries
  That flesh and bone may disappear,
  And souls as if they were but sighs,
  And there be nothing but God left;
  But I alone being blessed keep
  Like some old rabbit to my cleft
  And wait Him in a drunken sleep.`

  He dipped his ladle in the tub
  And drank and yawned and stretched him out.
  The other shouted, `You would rob
  My life of every pleasant thought
  And every comfortable thing
  And so take that and that.` Thereon
  He gave him a great pummelling,
  But might have pummelled at a stone
  For all the sleeper knew or cared;
  And after heaped the stones again
  And cursed and prayed, and prayed and cursed:
  `Oh God if he got loose!` And then
  In fury and in panic fled
  From the Hell Mouth at Cruachan
  And gave God thanks that overhead
  The clouds were brightening with the dawn.




THE PLAYER QUEEN


  My mother dandled me and sang,
  `How young it is, how young!`
  And made a golden cradle
  That on a willow swung.

  `He went away,` my mother sang,
  `When I was brought to bed,`
  And all the while her needle pulled
  The gold and silver thread.

  She pulled the thread and bit the thread
  And made a golden gown,
  And wept because she had dreamt that I
  Was born to wear a crown.

  `When she was got,` my mother sang,
  `I heard a sea-mew cry,
  And saw a flake of the yellow foam
  That dropped upon my thigh.`

  How therefore could she help but braid
  The gold into my hair,
  And dream that I should carry
  The golden top of care?




THE REALISTS


  Hope that you may understand!
  What can books of men that wive
  In a dragon-guarded land,
  Paintings of the dolphin-drawn
  Sea-nymphs in their pearly waggons
  Do, but awake a hope to live
  That had gone
  With the dragons?






THE WITCH


  Toil, and grow rich,
  What's that but to lie
  With a foul witch
  And after, drained dry,
  To be brought
  To the chamber where
  Lies one long sought
  With despair.






THE PEACOCK


  What's riches to him
  That has made a great peacock
  With the pride of his eye?
  The wind-beaten, stone-grey,
  And desolate Three-rock
  Would nourish his whim.
  Live he or die
  Amid wet rocks and heather,
  His ghost will be gay
  Adding feather to feather
  For the pride of his eye.




THE MOUNTAIN TOMB


  Pour wine and dance if Manhood still have pride,
  Bring roses if the rose be yet in bloom;
  The cataract smokes upon the mountain side,
  Our Father Rosicross is in his tomb.

  Pull down the blinds, bring fiddle and clarionet
  That there be no foot silent in the room
  Nor mouth from kissing, nor from wine unwet;
  Our Father Rosicross is in his tomb.

  In vain, in vain; the cataract still cries
  The everlasting taper lights the gloom;
  All wisdom shut into his onyx eyes
  Our Father Rosicross sleeps in his tomb.




TO A CHILD DANCING IN THE WIND



  Dance there upon the shore;
  What need have you to care
  For wind or water's roar?
  And tumble out your hair
  That the salt drops have wet;
  Being young you have not known
  The fool's triumph, nor yet
  Love lost as soon as won,
  Nor the best labourer dead
  And all the sheaves to bind.
  What need have you to dread
  The monstrous crying of wind?



  Has no one said those daring
  Kind eyes should be more learn'd?
  Or warned you how despairing
  The moths are when they are burned,
  I could have warned you, but you are young,
  So we speak a different tongue.

  O you will take whatever's offered
  And dream that all the world's a friend,
  Suffer as your mother suffered,
  Be as broken in the end.
  But I am old and you are young,
  And I speak a barbarous tongue.




A MEMORY OF YOUTH


  The moments passed as at a play,
  I had the wisdom love brings forth;
  I had my share of mother wit
  And yet for all that I could say,
  And though I had her praise for it,
  A cloud blown from the cut-throat north
  Suddenly hid love's moon away.

  Believing every word I said
  I praised her body and her mind
  Till pride had made her eyes grow bright,
  And pleasure made her cheeks grow red,
  And vanity her footfall light,
  Yet we, for all that praise, could find
  Nothing but darkness overhead.

  We sat as silent as a stone,
  We knew, though she'd not said a word,
  That even the best of love must die,
  And had been savagely undone
  Were it not that love upon the cry
  Of a most ridiculous little bird
  Tore from the clouds his marvellous moon.




FALLEN MAJESTY


  Although crowds gathered once if she but showed her face,
  And even old men's eyes grew dim, this hand alone,
  Like some last courtier at a gypsy camping place,
  Babbling of fallen majesty, records what's gone.

  The lineaments, a heart that laughter has made sweet,
  These, these remain, but I record what's gone. A crowd
  Will gather, and not know it walks the very street
  Whereon a thing once walked that seemed a burning cloud.




FRIENDS


  Now must I these three praise -- 
  Three women that have wrought
  What joy is in my days;
  One that no passing thought,
  Nor those unpassing cares,
  No, not in these fifteen
  Many times troubled years,
  Could ever come between
  Heart and delighted heart;
  And one because her hand
  Had strength that could unbind
  What none can understand,
  What none can have and thrive,
  Youth's dreamy load, till she
  So changed me that I live
  Labouring in ecstasy.
  And what of her that took
  All till my youth was gone
  With scarce a pitying look?
  How should I praise that one?
  When day begins to break
  I count my good and bad,
  Being wakeful for her sake,
  Remembering what she had,
  What eagle look still shows,
  While up from my heart's root
  So great a sweetness flows
  I shake from head to foot.




THE COLD HEAVEN


  Suddenly I saw the cold and rook-delighting Heaven
  That seemed as though ice burned and was but the more ice,
  And thereupon imagination and heart were driven
  So wild that every casual thought of that and this
  Vanished, and left but memories, that should be out of season
  With the hot blood of youth, of love crossed long ago;
  And I took all the blame out of all sense and reason,
  Until I cried and trembled and rocked to and fro,
  Riddled with light. Ah! when the ghost begins to quicken,
  Confusion of the death-bed over, is it sent
  Out naked on the roads, as the books say, and stricken
  By the injustice of the skies for punishment?




THAT THE NIGHT COME


  She lived in storm and strife,
  Her soul had such desire
  For what proud death may bring
  That it could not endure
  The common good of life,
  But lived as 'twere a king
  That packed his marriage day
  With banneret and pennon,
  Trumpet and kettledrum,
  And the outrageous cannon,
  To bundle time away
  That the night come.




AN APPOINTMENT


  Being out of heart with government
  I took a broken root to fling
  Where the proud, wayward squirrel went,
  Taking delight that he could spring;
  And he, with that low whinnying sound
  That is like laughter, sprang again
  And so to the other tree at a bound.
  Nor the tame will, nor timid brain,
  Bred that fierce tooth and cleanly limb
  And threw him up to laugh on the bough;
  No government appointed him.




THE MAGI


  Now as at all times I can see in the mind's eye,
  In their stiff, painted clothes, the pale unsatisfied ones
  Appear and disappear in the blue depth of the sky
  With all their ancient faces like rain-beaten stones,
  And all their helms of silver hovering side by side,
  And all their eyes still fixed, hoping to find once more,
  Being by Calvary's turbulence unsatisfied,
  The uncontrollable mystery on the bestial floor.





THE DOLLS


  A doll in the doll-maker's house
  Looks at the cradle and balls:
  `That is an insult to us.`
  But the oldest of all the dolls
  Who had seen, being kept for show,
  Generations of his sort,
  Out-screams the whole shelf: `Although
  There's not a man can report
  Evil of this place,
  The man and the woman bring
  Hither to our disgrace,
  A noisy and filthy thing.`
  Hearing him groan and stretch
  The doll-maker's wife is aware
  Her husband has heard the wretch,
  And crouched by the arm of his chair,
  She murmurs into his ear,
  Head upon shoulder leant:
  `My dear, my dear, oh dear,
  It was an accident.`




A COAT


  I made my song a coat
  Covered with embroideries
  Out of old mythologies
  From heel to throat;
  But the fools caught it,
  Wore it in the world's eye
  As though they'd wrought it.
  Song, let them take it
  For there's more enterprise
  In walking naked.




       *       *       *       *       *


  _While I, from that reed-throated whisperer_
  _Who comes at need, although not now as once_
  _A clear articulation in the air_
  _But inwardly, surmise companions_
  _Beyond the fling of the dull ass's hoof,_
  _ -- Ben Jonson's phrase -- and find when June is come_
  _At Kyle-na-no under that ancient roof_
  _A sterner conscience and a friendlier home,_
  _I can forgive even that wrong of wrongs,_
  _Those undreamt accidents that have made me_
  _ -- Seeing that Fame has perished this long while_
  _Being but a part of ancient ceremony -- _
  _Notorious, till all my priceless things_
  _Are but a post the passing dogs defile._




FROM THE GREEN HELMET AND OTHER POEMS




HIS DREAM


  I swayed upon the gaudy stern
  The butt end of a steering oar,
  And everywhere that I could turn
  Men ran upon the shore.

  And though I would have hushed the crowd
  There was no mother's son but said,
  `What is the figure in a shroud
  Upon a gaudy bed?`

  And fishes bubbling to the brim
  Cried out upon that thing beneath,
  -- It had such dignity of limb -- 
  By the sweet name of Death.

  Though I'd my finger on my lip,
  What could I but take up the song?
  And fish and crowd and gaudy ship
  Cried out the whole night long,

  Crying amid the glittering sea,
  Naming it with ecstatic breath,
  Because it had such dignity
  By the sweet name of Death.




A WOMAN HOMER SUNG


  If any man drew near
  When I was young,
  I thought, `He holds her dear,`
  And shook with hate and fear.
  But oh, 'twas bitter wrong
  If he could pass her by
  With an indifferent eye.

  Whereon I wrote and wrought,
  And now, being grey,
  I dream that I have brought
  To such a pitch my thought
  That coming time can say,
  `He shadowed in a glass
  What thing her body was.`

  For she had fiery blood
  When I was young,
  And trod so sweetly proud
  As 'twere upon a cloud,
  A woman Homer sung,
  That life and letters seem
  But an heroic dream.




THE CONSOLATION


  I had this thought awhile ago,
  `My darling cannot understand
  What I have done, or what would do
  In this blind bitter land.`

  And I grew weary of the sun
  Until my thoughts cleared up again,
  Remembering that the best I have done
  Was done to make it plain;

  That every year I have cried, `At length
  My darling understands it all,
  Because I have come into my strength,
  And words obey my call.`

  That had she done so who can say
  What would have shaken from the sieve?
  I might have thrown poor words away
  And been content to live.




NO SECOND TROY


  Why should I blame her that she filled my days
  With misery, or that she would of late
  Have taught to ignorant men most violent ways,
  Or hurled the little streets upon the great,
  Had they but courage equal to desire?
  What could have made her peaceful with a mind
  That nobleness made simple as a fire,
  With beauty like a tightened bow, a kind
  That is not natural in an age like this,
  Being high and solitary and most stern?
  Why, what could she have done being what she is?
  Was there another Troy for her to burn?




RECONCILIATION


  Some may have blamed you that you took away
  The verses that could move them on the day
  When, the ears being deafened, the sight of the eyes blind
  With lightning you went from me, and I could find
  Nothing to make a song about but kings,
  Helmets, and swords, and half-forgotten things
  That were like memories of you -- but now
  We'll out, for the world lives as long ago;
  And while we're in our laughing, weeping fit,
  Hurl helmets, crowns, and swords into the pit.
  But, dear, cling close to me; since you were gone,
  My barren thoughts have chilled me to the bone.




KING AND NO KING


  `Would it were anything but merely voice!`
  The No King cried who after that was King,
  Because he had not heard of anything
  That balanced with a word is more than noise;
  Yet Old Romance being kind, let him prevail
  Somewhere or somehow that I have forgot,
  Though he'd but cannon -- Whereas we that had thought
  To have lit upon as clean and sweet a tale
  Have been defeated by that pledge you gave
  In momentary anger long ago;
  And I that have not your faith, how shall I know
  That in the blinding light beyond the grave
  We'll find so good a thing as that we have lost?
  The hourly kindness, the day's common speech,
  The habitual content of each with each
  When neither soul nor body has been crossed.




PEACE


  Ah, that Time could touch a form
  That could show what Homer's age
  Bred to be a hero's wage.
  `Were not all her life but storm,
  Would not painters paint a form
  Of such noble lines,` I said,
  `Such a delicate high head,
  All that sternness amid charm,
  All that sweetness amid strength?`
  Ah, but peace that comes at length,
  Came when Time had touched her form.




AGAINST UNWORTHY PRAISE


  O heart, be at peace, because
  Nor knave nor dolt can break
  What's not for their applause,
  Being for a woman's sake.
  Enough if the work has seemed,
  So did she your strength renew,
  A dream that a lion had dreamed
  Till the wilderness cried aloud,
  A secret between you two,
  Between the proud and the proud.

  What, still you would have their praise!
  But here's a haughtier text,
  The labyrinth of her days
  That her own strangeness perplexed;
  And how what her dreaming gave
  Earned slander, ingratitude,
  From self-same dolt and knave;
  Aye, and worse wrong than these,
  Yet she, singing upon her road,
  Half lion, half child, is at peace.




THE FASCINATION OF WHAT'S DIFFICULT


  The fascination of what's difficult
  Has dried the sap out of my veins, and rent
  Spontaneous joy and natural content
  Out of my heart. There's something ails our colt
  That must, as if it had not holy blood,
  Nor on an Olympus leaped from cloud to cloud,
  Shiver under the lash, strain, sweat and jolt
  As though it dragged road metal. My curse on plays
  That have to be set up in fifty ways,
  On the day's war with every knave and dolt,
  Theatre business, management of men.
  I swear before the dawn comes round again
  I'll find the stable and pull out the bolt.




A DRINKING SONG


  Wine comes in at the mouth
  And love comes in at the eye;
  That's all we shall know for truth
  Before we grow old and die.
  I lift the glass to my mouth,
  I look at you, and I sigh.




THE COMING OF WISDOM WITH TIME


  Though leaves are many, the root is one;
  Through all the lying days of my youth
  I swayed my leaves and flowers in the sun;
  Now I may wither into the truth.




ON HEARING THAT THE STUDENTS OF OUR NEW UNIVERSITY HAVE JOINED THE
ANCIENT ORDER OF HIBERNIANS AND THE AGITATION AGAINST IMMORAL
LITERATURE


  Where, where but here have Pride and Truth,
  That long to give themselves for wage,
  To shake their wicked sides at youth
  Restraining reckless middle-age.




TO A POET, WHO WOULD HAVE ME PRAISE CERTAIN BAD POETS, IMITATORS OF
HIS
AND MINE


  You say, as I have often given tongue
  In praise of what another's said or sung,
  'Twere politic to do the like by these;
  But have you known a dog to praise his fleas?




THE MASK


  `Put off that mask of burning gold
  With emerald eyes.`
  `O no, my dear, you make so bold
  To find if hearts be wild and wise,
  And yet not cold.`

  `I would but find what's there to find,
  Love or deceit.`
  `It was the mask engaged your mind,
  And after set your heart to beat,
  Not what's behind.`

  `But lest you are my enemy,
  I must enquire.`
  `O no, my dear, let all that be,
  What matter, so there is but fire
  In you, in me?`




UPON A HOUSE SHAKEN BY THE LAND AGITATION


  How should the world be luckier if this house,
  Where passion and precision have been one
  Time out of mind, became too ruinous
  To breed the lidless eye that loves the sun?
  And the sweet laughing eagle thoughts that grow
  Where wings have memory of wings, and all
  That comes of the best knit to the best? Although
  Mean roof-trees were the sturdier for its fall,
  How should their luck run high enough to reach
  The gifts that govern men, and after these
  To gradual Time's last gift, a written speech
  Wrought of high laughter, loveliness and ease?




AT THE ABBEY THEATRE


  Dear Craoibhin Aoibhin, look into our case.
  When we are high and airy hundreds say
  That if we hold that flight they'll leave the place,
  While those same hundreds mock another day
  Because we have made our art of common things,
  So bitterly, you'd dream they longed to look
  All their lives through into some drift of wings.
  You've dandled them and fed them from the book
  And know them to the bone; impart to us -- 
  We'll keep the secret -- a new trick to please.
  Is there a bridle for this Proteus
  That turns and changes like his draughty seas?
  Or is there none, most popular of men,
  But when they mock us that we mock again?




THESE ARE THE CLOUDS


  These are the clouds about the fallen sun,
  The majesty that shuts his burning eye;
  The weak lay hand on what the strong has done,
  Till that be tumbled that was lifted high
  And discord follow upon unison,
  And all things at one common level lie.
  And therefore, friend, if your great race were run
  And these things came, so much the more thereby
  Have you made greatness your companion,
  Although it be for children that you sigh:
  These are the clouds about the fallen sun,
  The majesty that shuts his burning eye.




AT GALWAY RACES


  There where the course is,
  Delight makes all of the one mind,
  The riders upon the galloping horses,
  The crowd that closes in behind:
  We, too, had good attendance once,
  Hearers and hearteners of the work;
  Aye, horsemen for companions,
  Before the merchant and the clerk
  Breathed on the world with timid breath.
  Sing on: sometime, and at some new moon,
  We'll learn that sleeping is not death,
  Hearing the whole earth change its tune,
  Its flesh being wild, and it again
  Crying aloud as the race course is,
  And we find hearteners among men
  That ride upon horses.




A FRIEND'S ILLNESS


  Sickness brought me this
  Thought, in that scale of his:
  Why should I be dismayed
  Though flame had burned the whole
  World, as it were a coal,
  Now I have seen it weighed
  Against a soul?




ALL THINGS CAN TEMPT ME


  All things can tempt me from this craft of verse:
  One time it was a woman's face, or worse -- 
  The seeming needs of my fool-driven land;
  Now nothing but comes readier to the hand
  Than this accustomed toil. When I was young,
  I had not given a penny for a song
  Did not the poet sing it with such airs
  That one believed he had a sword upstairs;
  Yet would be now, could I but have my wish,
  Colder and dumber and deafer than a fish.




THE YOUNG MAN'S SONG


  I whispered, `I am too young,`
  And then, `I am old enough;`
  Wherefore I threw a penny
  To find out if I might love.
  `Go and love, go and love, young man,
  If the lady be young and fair.`
  Ah, penny, brown penny, brown penny,
  I am looped in the loops of her hair.

  Oh, love is the crooked thing,
  There is nobody wise enough
  To find out all that is in it,
  For he would be thinking of love
  Till the stars had run away,
  And the shadows eaten the moon.
  Ah, penny, brown penny, brown penny,
  One cannot begin it too soon.

THE PERSONS OF THE PLAY


  WISE MAN.
  BRIDGET, his wife.
  TEIGUE, a fool.
  ANGEL.
  Children and Pupils.


_Pupils come in and stand before the stage curtain, which is still
closed. One pupil carries a book._

FIRST PUPIL

He said we might choose the subject for the lesson.

SECOND PUPIL

There is none of us wise enough to do that.

THIRD PUPIL

It would need a great deal of wisdom to know what it is we want to know.

FOURTH PUPIL

I will question him.

FIFTH PUPIL

You?

FOURTH PUPIL

Last night I dreamt that some one came and told me to question him.
I was to say to him, `You were wrong to say there is no God and no
soul -- maybe, if there is not much of either, there is yet some tatters,
some tag on the wind -- so to speak -- some rag upon a bush, some bob-tail
of a god.` I will argue with him, -- nonsense though it be -- according to
my dream, and you will see how well I can argue, and what thoughts I have.


FIRST PUPIL

I'd as soon listen to dried peas in a bladder, as listen to your thoughts.

                                                      _Fool comes in._

FOOL

Give me a penny.

SECOND PUPIL

Let us choose a subject by chance. Here is his big book. Let us turn
over the pages slowly. Let one of us put down his finger without looking.
The passage his finger lights on will be the subject for the lesson.

FOOL

Give me a penny.

THIRD PUPIL

(_Taking up book_) How heavy it is.

FOURTH PUPIL

Spread it on Teigue's back, and then we can all stand round and see the
choice.

SECOND PUPIL

Make him spread out his arms.

FOURTH PUPIL

Down on your knees. Hunch up your back. Spread your arms out now, and
look like a golden eagle in a church. Keep still, keep still.

FOOL

Give me a penny.

THIRD PUPIL

Is that the right cry for an eagle cock?

SECOND PUPIL

I'll turn the pages -- you close your eyes and put your finger down.

THIRD PUPIL

That's it, and then he cannot blame us for the choice.

FIRST PUPIL

There, I have chosen. Fool, keep still -- and if what's wise is strange
and sounds like nonsense, we've made a good choice.

FIFTH PUPIL

The Master has come.

FOOL

Will anybody give a penny to a fool?

    _One of the pupils draws back the stage curtain showing the Master
        sitting at his desk. There is an hour-glass upon his desk or in
            a bracket on the wall. One pupil puts the book before him._

FIRST PUPIL

We have chosen the passage for the lesson, Master. `There are two
living countries, one visible and one invisible, and when it is summer
there, it is winter here, and when it is November with us, it is
lambing-time there.`

WISE MAN

That passage, that passage! what mischief has there been since yesterday?

FIRST PUPIL

None, Master.

WISE MAN

Oh yes, there has; some craziness has fallen from the wind, or risen
from the graves of old men, and made you choose that subject.

FOURTH PUPIL

I knew that it was folly, but they would have it.

THIRD PUPIL

Had we not better say we picked it by chance?

SECOND PUPIL

No; he would say we were children still.

FIRST PUPIL

I have found a sentence under that one that says -- as though to show it
had a hidden meaning -- a beggar wrote it upon the walls of Babylon.

WISE MAN

Then find some beggar and ask him what it means, for I will have nothing
to do with it.

FOURTH PUPIL

Come, Teigue, what is the old book's meaning when it says that there are
sheep that drop their lambs in November?

FOOL

To be sure -- everybody knows, everybody in the world knows, when it is
Spring with us, the trees are withering there, when it is Summer with
us, the snow is falling there, and have I not myself heard the lambs
that are there all bleating on a cold November day -- to be sure, does not
everybody with an intellect know that; and maybe when it's night with
us, it is day with them, for many a time I have seen the roads lighted
before me.

WISE MAN

The beggar who wrote that on Babylon wall meant that there is a
spiritual kingdom that cannot be seen or known till the faculties
whereby we master the kingdom of this world wither away, like green
things in winter. A monkish thought, the most mischievous thought that
ever passed out of a man's mouth.

FIRST PUPIL

If he meant all that, I will take an oath that he was spindle-shanked,
and cross-eyed, and had a lousy itching shoulder, and that his heart was
crosser than his eyes, and that he wrote it out of malice.

SECOND PUPIL

Let's come away and find a better subject.

FOURTH PUPIL

And maybe now you'll let me choose.

FIRST PUPIL

Come.

WISE MAN

  Were it but true 'twould alter everything
  Until the stream of the world had changed its course,
  And that and all our thoughts had run
  Into some cloudy thunderous spring
  They dream to be its source -- 
  Aye, to some frenzy of the mind;
  And all that we have done would be undone,
  Our speculation but as the wind.

                                                            _A pause._

  I have dreamed it twice.

FIRST PUPIL

      Something has troubled him.

                                                      _Pupils go out._

WISE MAN

  Twice have I dreamed it in a morning dream,
  Now nothing serves my pupils but to come
  With a like thought. Reason is growing dim;
  A moment more and Frenzy will beat his drum
  And laugh aloud and scream;
  And I must dance in the dream.
  No, no, but it is like a hawk, a hawk of the air,
  It has swooped down -- and this swoop makes the third -- 
  And what can I, but tremble like a bird?

FOOL

Give me a penny.

WISE MAN

That I should dream it twice, and after that, that they should pick it out.

FOOL

Won't you give me a penny?

WISE MAN

What do you want? What can it matter to you whether the words I am
reading are wisdom or sheer folly?

FOOL

Such a great, wise teacher will not refuse a penny to a fool.

WISE MAN

Seeing that everybody is a fool when he is asleep and dreaming, why do
you call me wise?

FOOL

O, I know, -- I know, I know what I have seen.

WISE MAN

Well, to see rightly is the whole of wisdom, whatever dream be with us.

FOOL

When I went by Kilcluan, where the bells used to be ringing at the break
of every day, I could hear nothing but the people snoring in their houses.
When I went by Tubbervanach, where the young men used to be climbing the
hill to the blessed well, they were sitting at the cross-roads playing
cards. When I went by Carrigoras, where the friars used to be fasting
and serving the poor, I saw them drinking wine and obeying their wives.
And when I asked what misfortune had brought all these changes, they
said it was no misfortune, but that it was the wisdom they had learned
from your teaching.

WISE MAN

And you too have called me wise -- you would be paid for that good opinion
doubtless -- Run to the kitchen, my wife will give you food and drink.

FOOL

That's foolish advice for a wise man to give.

WISE MAN

Why, Fool?

FOOL

What is eaten is gone -- I want pennies for my bag. I must buy bacon in
the shops, and nuts in the market, and strong drink for the time the sun
is weak, and snares to catch the rabbits and the hares, and a big pot to
cook them in.

WISE MAN

I have more to think about than giving pennies to your like, so run away.

FOOL

Give me a penny and I will bring you luck. The fishermen let me sleep
among their nets in the loft because I bring them luck; and in the
summer time, the wild creatures let me sleep near their nests and their
holes. It is lucky even to look at me, but it is much more lucky to give
me a penny. If I was not lucky I would starve.

WISE MAN

What are the shears for?

FOOL

I won't tell you. If I told you, you would drive them away.

WISE MAN

Drive them away! Who would I drive away?

FOOL

I won't tell you.

WISE MAN

Not if I give you a penny?

FOOL

No.

WISE MAN

Not if I give you two pennies?

FOOL

You will be very lucky if you give me two pennies, but I won't tell you.

WISE MAN

Three pennies?

FOOL

Four, and I will tell you.

WISE MAN

Very well -- four, but from this out I will not call you Teigue the Fool.

FOOL

Let me come close to you, where nobody will hear me; but first you must
promise not to drive them away. (_Wise Man nods._) Every day men go out
dressed in black and spread great black nets over the hills, great black
nets.

WISE MAN

A strange place that to fish in.

FOOL

They spread them out on the hills that they may catch the feet of the
angels; but every morning just before the dawn, I go out and cut the
nets with the shears and the angels fly away.

WISE MAN

(_Speaking with excitement_) Ah, now I know that you are Teigue the
Fool. You say that I am wise, and yet I say, there are no angels.

FOOL

I have seen plenty of angels.

WISE MAN

No, no, you have not.

FOOL

They are plenty if you but look about you. They are like the blades
of grass.

WISE MAN

They are plenty as the blades of grass -- I heard that phrase when I was
but a child and was told folly.

FOOL

When one gets quiet. When one is so quiet that there is not a thought in
one's head maybe, there is something that wakes up inside one, something
happy and quiet, and then all in a minute one can smell summer flowers,
and tall people go by, happy and laughing, but they will not let us look
at their faces. Oh no, it is not right that we should look at their faces.

WISE MAN

You have fallen asleep upon a hill, yet, even those that used to dream
of angels dream now of other things.

FOOL

I saw one but a moment ago -- that is because I am lucky. It was coming
behind me, but it was not laughing.

WISE MAN

There's nothing but what men can see when they are awake. Nothing, nothing.

FOOL

I knew you would drive them away.

WISE MAN

  Pardon me, Fool,
  I had forgotten who I spoke to.
  Well, there are your four pennies -- Fool you are called,
  And all day long they cry, `Come hither, Fool.`

                                         _The Fool goes close to him._

  Or else it's, `Fool, be gone.`

                                          _The Fool goes further off._

  Or, `Fool, stand there.`

                                    _The Fool straightens himself up._

  Or, `Fool, go sit in the corner.`

                                        _The Fool sits in the corner._

                            And all the while
  What were they all but fools before I came?
  What are they now, but mirrors that seem men,
  Because of my image? Fool, hold up your head.

                                                       _Fool does so._

  What foolish stories they have told of the ghosts
  That fumbled with the clothes upon the bed,
  Or creaked and shuffled in the corridor,
  Or else, if they were pious bred,
  Of angels from the skies,
  That coming through the door,
  Or, it may be, standing there,
  Would solidly out stare
  The steadiest eyes with their unnatural eyes,
  Aye, on a man's own floor.

              _An angel has come in. It should be played by a man if a
                  man can be found with the right voice, and may wear a
                  little golden domino and a halo made of metal. Or the
                  whole face may be a beautiful mask, in which case the
                       last sentence on page 136 should not be spoken._

  Yet it is strange, the strangest thing I have known,
  That I should still be haunted by the notion
  That there's a crisis of the spirit wherein
  We get new sight, and that they know some trick
  To turn our thoughts for their own ends to frenzy.
  Why do you put your finger to your lip,
  And creep away?

                                                      _Fool goes out._

  (_Wise Man sees Angel._) What are you? Who are you?
  I think I saw some like you in my dreams,
  When but a child. That thing about your head, -- 
  That brightness in your hair -- that flowery branch;
  But I have done with dreams, I have done with dreams.

ANGEL

  I am the crafty one that you have called.

WISE MAN

  How that I called?

ANGEL

                     I am the messenger.

WISE MAN

  What message could you bring to one like me?

ANGEL (_turning the hour-glass_)

  That you will die when the last grain of sand
  Has fallen through this glass.

WISE MAN

                                 I have a wife.
  Children and pupils that I cannot leave:
  Why must I die, my time is far away?

ANGEL

  You have to die because no soul has passed
  The heavenly threshold since you have opened school,
  But grass grows there, and rust upon the hinge;
  And they are lonely that must keep the watch.

WISE MAN

  And whither shall I go when I am dead?

ANGEL

  You have denied there is a purgatory,
  Therefore that gate is closed; you have denied
  There is a heaven, and so that gate is closed.

WISE MAN

  Where then? For I have said there is no hell.

ANGEL

  Hell is the place of those who have denied;
  They find there what they planted and what dug,
  A Lake of Spaces, and a Wood of Nothing,
  And wander there and drift, and never cease
  Wailing for substance.

WISE MAN

                         Pardon me, blessed Angel,
  I have denied and taught the like to others.
  But how could I believe before my sight
  Had come to me?

ANGEL

                   It is too late for pardon.

WISE MAN

  Had I but met your gaze as now I met it -- 
  But how can you that live but where we go
  In the uncertainty of dizzy dreams
  Know why we doubt? Parting, sickness and death,
  The rotting of the grass, tempest and drouth,
  These are the messengers that came to me.
  Why are you silent? You carry in your hands
  God's pardon, and you will not give it me.
  Why are you silent? Were I not afraid,
  I'd kiss your hands -- no, no, the hem of your dress.

ANGEL

  Only when all the world has testified,
  May soul confound it, crying out in joy,
  And laughing on its lonely precipice.
  What's dearth and death and sickness to the soul
  That knows no virtue but itself? Nor could it,
  So trembling with delight and mother-naked,
  Live unabashed if the arguing world stood by.

WISE MAN

  It is as hard for you to understand
  Why we have doubted, as it is for us
  To banish doubt -- what folly have I said?
  There can be nothing that you do not know:
  Give me a year -- a month -- a week -- a day,
  I would undo what I have done -- an hour -- 
  Give me until the sand has run in the glass.

ANGEL

  Though you may not undo what you have done,
  I have this power -- if you but find one soul,
  Before the sands have fallen, that still believes,
  One fish to lie and spawn among the stones
  Till the great fisher's net is full again,
  You may, the purgatorial fire being passed,
  Spring to your peace.

                                        _Pupils sing in the distance._

  `Who stole your wits away
  And where are they gone?`

WISE MAN

                        My pupils come,
  Before you have begun to climb the sky
  I shall have found that soul. They say they doubt,
  But what their mothers dinned into their ears
  Cannot have been so lightly rooted up;
  Besides, I can disprove what I once proved -- 
  And yet give me some thought, some argument,
  More mighty than my own.

ANGEL

                          Farewell -- farewell,
  For I am weary of the weight of time.

          _Angel goes out. Wise Man makes a step to follow and pauses.
            Some of his pupils come in at the other side of the stage._

FIRST PUPIL

  Master, master, you must choose the subject.

             _Enter other pupils with Fool, about whom they dance; all
                 the pupils may have little cushions on which presently
                                                 they seat themselves._

SECOND PUPIL

  Here is a subject -- where have the Fool's wits gone? (_singing_)
  `Who dragged your wits away
  Where no one knows?
  Or have they run off
  On their own pair of shoes?`

FOOL

Give me a penny.

FIRST PUPIL

                   The Master will find your wits,

SECOND PUPIL

  And when they are found, you must not beg for pennies.

THIRD PUPIL

  They are hidden somewhere in the badger's hole,
  But you must carry an old candle end
  If you would find them.

FOURTH PUPIL

                          They are up above the clouds.

FOOL

Give me a penny, give me a penny.

FIRST PUPIL (_singing_)

  `I'll find your wits again,
  Come, for I saw them roll,
  To where old badger mumbles
  In the black hole.`

SECOND PUPIL (_singing_)

  `No, but an angel stole them
  The night that you were born,
  And now they are but a rag,
  On the moon's horn.`

WISE MAN

Be silent.

FIRST PUPIL

  Can you not see that he is troubled?

                                          _All the pupils are seated._

WISE MAN

  What do you think of when alone at night?
  Do not the things your mothers spoke about,
  Before they took the candle from the bedside,
  Rush up into the mind and master it,
  Till you believe in them against your will?

SECOND PUPIL (_to first pupil_)

  You answer for us.

THIRD PUPIL (_in a whisper to first pupil_)

                     Be careful what you say;
  If he persuades you to an argument,
  He will but turn us all to mockery.

FIRST PUPIL

  We had no minds until you made them for us;
  Our bodies only were our mothers' work.

WISE MAN

  You answer with incredible things. It is certain
  That there is one, -- though it may be but one -- 
  Believes in God and in some heaven and hell -- 
  In all those things we put into our prayers.

FIRST PUPIL

  We thought those things before our minds were born,
  But that was long ago -- we are not children.

WISE MAN

  You are afraid to tell me what you think
  Because I am hot and angry when I am crossed.
  I do not blame you for it; but have no fear,
  For if there's one that sat on smiling there,
  As though my arguments were sweet as milk
  Yet found them bitter, I will thank him for it,
  If he but speak his mind.

FIRST PUPIL

                            There is no one, Master,
  There is not one but found them sweet as milk.

WISE MAN

  The things that have been told us in our childhood
  Are not so fragile.

SECOND PUPIL

                       We are no longer children.

THIRD PUPIL

  We all believe in you and in what you have taught.

OTHER PUPILS

  All, all, all, all, in you, nothing but you.

WISE MAN

  I have deceived you -- where shall I go for words -- 
  I have no thoughts -- my mind has been swept bare.
  The messengers that stand in the fiery cloud,
  Fling themselves out, if we but dare to question,
  And after that, the Babylonian moon
  Blots all away.

FIRST PUPIL (_to other pupils_)

                   I take his words to mean
  That visionaries, and martyrs when they are raised
  Above translunary things, and there enlightened,
  As the contention is, may lose the light,
  And flounder in their speech when the eyes open.

SECOND PUPIL

  How well he imitates their trick of speech.

THIRD PUPIL

  Their air of mystery.

FOURTH PUPIL

                        Their empty gaze,
  As though they'd looked upon some winged thing,
  And would not condescend to mankind after.

FIRST PUPIL

  Master, we have all learnt that truth is learnt
  When the intellect's deliberate and cold,
  As it were a polished mirror that reflects
  An unchanged world; and not when the steel melts,
  Bubbling and hissing, till there's naught but fume.

WISE MAN

  When it is melted, when it all fumes up,
  They walk, as when beside those three in the furnace
  The form of the fourth.

FIRST PUPIL

                          Master, there's none among us
  That has not heard your mockery of these,
  Or thoughts like these, and we have not forgot.

WISE MAN

  Something incredible has happened -- some one has come
  Suddenly like a grey hawk out of the air,
  And all that I declared untrue is true.

FIRST PUPIL (_to other pupils_)

  You'd think the way he says it, that he felt it.
  There's not a mummer to compare with him.
  He's something like a man.

SECOND PUPIL

                             Give us some proof.

WISE MAN

  What proof have I to give, but that an angel
  An instant ago was standing on that spot.

                                                    _The pupils rise._

THIRD PUPIL

  You dreamed it.

WISE MAN

                  I was awake as I am now.

FIRST PUPIL (_to the others_)

  I may be dreaming now for all I know.
  He wants to show we have no certain proof
  Of anything in the world.

SECOND PUPIL

                            There is this proof
  That shows we are awake -- we have all one world
  While every dreamer has a world of his own,
  And sees what no one else can.

THIRD PUPIL

                                 Teigue sees angels.
  So when the Master says he has seen an angel,
  He may have seen one.

FIRST PUPIL

                        Both may still be dreamers;
  Unless it's proved the angels were alike.

SECOND PUPIL

  What sort are the angels, Teigue?

THIRD PUPIL

                That will prove nothing,
  Unless we are sure prolonged obedience
  Has made one angel like another angel
  As they were eggs.

FIRST PUPIL

                     The Master's silent now:
  For he has found that to dispute with us -- 
  Seeing that he has taught us what we know -- 
  Is but to reason with himself. Let us away,
  And find if there is one believer left.

WISE MAN

  Yes, yes. Find me but one that still believes
  The things that we were told when we were children.

THIRD PUPIL

  He'll mock and maul him.

FOURTH PUPIL

                           From the first I knew
  He wanted somebody to argue with.

                                                            _They go._

WISE MAN

  I have no reason left. All dark, all dark!

             _Pupils return laughing. They push forward fourth pupil._

FIRST PUPIL

  Here, Master, is the very man you want.
  He said, when we were studying the book,
  That maybe after all the monks were right,
  And you mistaken, and if we but gave him time,
  He'd prove that it was so.

FOURTH PUPIL

                             I never said it.

WISE MAN

  Dear friend, dear friend, do you believe in God?

FOURTH PUPIL

  Master, they have invented this to mock me.

WISE MAN

  You are afraid of me.

FOURTH PUPIL

                        They know well, Master,
  That all I said was but to make them argue.
  They've pushed me in to make a mock of me,
  Because they knew I could take either side
  And beat them at it.

WISE MAN

                      If you believe in God,
  You are my soul's one friend.

                                                       _Pupils laugh._

                                Mistress or wife
  Can give us but our good or evil luck
  Amid the howling world, but you shall give
  Eternity, and those sweet-throated things
  That drift above the moon.

                      _The pupils look at one another and are silent._

SECOND PUPIL

                             How strange he is.

WISE MAN

  The angel that stood there upon that spot,
  Said that my soul was lost unless I found out
  One that believed.

FOURTH PUPIL

                      Cease mocking at me, Master,
  For I am certain that there is no God
  Nor immortality, and they that said it
  Made a fantastic tale from a starved dream
  To plague our hearts. Will that content you, Master?

WISE MAN

  The giddy glass is emptier every moment,
  And you stand there, debating, laughing and wrangling.
  Out of my sight! Out of my sight, I say.

                                                 _He drives them out._

  I'll call my wife, for what can women do,
  That carry us in the darkness of their bodies,
  But mock the reason that lets nothing grow
  Unless it grow in light. Bridget, Bridget.
  A woman never ceases to believe,
  Say what we will. Bridget, come quickly, Bridget.

            _Bridget comes in wearing her apron. Her sleeves turned up
                          from her arms, which are covered with flour._

  Wife, what do you believe in? Tell me the truth,
  And not -- as is the habit with you all -- 
  Something you think will please me. Do you pray?
  Sometimes when you're alone in the house, do you pray?

BRIDGET

Prayers -- no, you taught me to leave them off long ago. At first I was
sorry, but I am glad now, for I am sleepy in the evenings.

WISE MAN

Do you believe in God?

BRIDGET

Oh, a good wife only believes in what her husband tells her.

WISE MAN

  But sometimes, when the children are asleep
  And I am in the school, do you not think
  About the Martyrs and the saints and the angels,
  And all the things that you believed in once?

BRIDGET

I think about nothing -- sometimes I wonder if the linen is bleaching
white, or I go out to see if the crows are picking up the chickens' food.

WISE MAN

  My God, -- my God! I will go out myself.
  My pupils said that they would find a man
  Whose faith I never shook -- they may have found him.
  Therefore I will go out -- but if I go,
  The glass will let the sands run out unseen.
  I cannot go -- I cannot leave the glass.
  Go call my pupils -- I can explain all now,
  Only when all our hold on life is troubled,
  Only in spiritual terror can the Truth
  Come through the broken mind -- as the pease burst
  Out of a broken pease-cod.

                                _He clutches Bridget as she is going._

                            Say to them,
  That Nature would lack all in her most need,
  Could not the soul find truth as in a flash,
  Upon the battle-field, or in the midst
  Of overwhelming waves, and say to them -- 
  But no, they would but answer as I bid.

BRIDGET

You want somebody to get up an argument with.

WISE MAN

  Look out and see if there is any one
  There in the street -- I cannot leave the glass,
  For somebody might shake it, and the sand
  If it were shaken might run down on the instant.

BRIDGET

I don't understand a word you are saying. There's a crowd of people
talking to your pupils.

WISE MAN

  Go out and find if they have found a man
  Who did not understand me when I taught,
  Or did not listen.

BRIDGET

It is a hard thing to be married to a man of learning that must always
be having arguments.

                                                       _She goes out._

WISE MAN

  Strange that I should be blind to the great secret,
  And that so simple a man might write it out
  Upon a blade of grass or bit of rush
  With naught but berry juice, and laugh to himself
  Writing it out, because it was so simple.

                                 _Enter Bridget followed by the Fool._

FOOL

Give me something; give me a penny to buy bacon in the shops and nuts in
the market, and strong drink for the time when the sun is weak.

BRIDGET

I have no pennies. (_To Wise Man_) Your pupils cannot find anybody to
argue with you. There's nobody in the whole country with belief enough
for a lover's oath. Can't you be quiet now, and not always wanting to
have arguments? It must be terrible to have a mind like that.

WISE MAN

Then I am lost indeed.

BRIDGET

Leave me alone now, I have to make the bread for you and the children.

                                              _She goes into kitchen._

WISE MAN

Children, children!


BRIDGET

Your father wants you, run to him.

                                                    _Children run in._

WISE MAN

  Come to me, children. Do not be afraid.
  I want to know if you believe in Heaven,
  God or the soul -- no, do not tell me yet;
  You need not be afraid I shall be angry,
  Say what you please -- so that it is your thought -- 
  I wanted you to know before you spoke,
  That I shall not be angry.

FIRST CHILD

We have not forgotten, Father.

SECOND CHILD

Oh no, Father.

BOTH CHILDREN

(_As if repeating a lesson_) There is nothing we cannot see, nothing we
cannot touch.

FIRST CHILD

Foolish people used to say that there was, but you have taught us better.

WISE MAN

  Go to your mother, go -- yet do not go.
  What can she say? If I am dumb you are lost;
  And yet, because the sands are running out,
  I have but a moment to show it all in. Children,
  The sap would die out of the blades of grass
  Had they a doubt. They understand it all,
  Being the fingers of God's certainty,
  Yet can but make their sign into the air;
  But could they find their tongues they'd show it all;
  But what am I to say that am but one,
  When they are millions and they will not speak -- 

                                              _Children have run out._

  But they are gone; what made them run away?

                                 _The Fool comes in with a dandelion._

  Look at me, tell me if my face is changed,
  Is there a notch of the fiend's nail upon it
  Already? Is it terrible to sight?
  Because the moment's near.

                                                     _Going to glass._

                            I dare not look,
  I dare not know the moment when they come.
  No, no, I dare not. (_Covers glass._)
  Will there be a footfall,
  Or will there be a sort of rending sound,
  Or else a cracking, as though an iron claw
  Had gripped the threshold stone?

                               _Fool has begun to blow the dandelion._

                    What are you doing?

FOOL

Wait a minute -- four -- five -- six -- 

WISE MAN

What are you doing that for?

FOOL

I am blowing the dandelion to find out what hour it is.

WISE MAN

  You have heard everything, and that is why
  You'd find what hour it is -- you'd find that out,
  That you may look upon a fleet of devils
  Dragging my soul away. You shall not stop,
  I will have no one here when they come in,
  I will have no one sitting there -- no one -- 
  And yet -- and yet -- there is something strange about you.
  I half remember something. What is it?
  Do you believe in God and in the soul?

FOOL

So you ask me now. I thought when you were asking your pupils, `Will he
ask Teigue the Fool? Yes, he will, he will; no, he will not -- yes, he
will.` But Teigue will say nothing. Teigue will say nothing.

WISE MAN

Tell me quickly.

FOOL

I said, `Teigue knows everything, not even the green-eyed cats and the
hares that milk the cows have Teigue's wisdom`; but Teigue will not speak,
he says nothing.

WISE MAN

  Speak, speak, for underneath the cover there
  The sand is running from the upper glass,
  And when the last grain's through, I shall be lost.

FOOL

I will not speak. I will not tell you what is in my mind. I will not
tell you what is in my bag. You might steal away my thoughts. I met a
bodach on the road yesterday, and he said, `Teigue, tell me how many
pennies are in your bag; I will wager three pennies that there are
not twenty pennies in your bag; let me put in my hand and count them.`
But I gripped the bag the tighter, and when I go to sleep at night I
hide the bag where nobody knows.

WISE MAN

  There's but one pinch of sand, and I am lost
  If you are not he I seek.

FOOL

O, what a lot the Fool knows, but he says nothing.

WISE MAN

  Yes, I remember now. You spoke of angels.
  You said but now that you had seen an angel.
  You are the one I seek, and I am saved.

FOOL

Oh no. How could poor Teigue see angels? Oh, Teigue tells one tale here,
another there, and everybody gives him pennies. If Teigue had not his
tales he would starve.

                                        _He breaks away and goes out._

WISE MAN

  The last hope is gone,
  And now that it's too late I see it all,
  We perish into God and sink away
  Into reality -- the rest's a dream.

                                                _The Fool comes back._

FOOL

There was one there -- there by the threshold stone, waiting there; and he
said, `Go in, Teigue, and tell him everything that he asks you. He will
give you a penny if you tell him.`

WISE MAN

  I know enough, that know God's will prevails.

FOOL

Waiting till the moment had come -- That is what the one out there was
saying, but I might tell you what you asked. That is what he was saying.

WISE MAN

  Be silent. May God's will prevail on the instant,
  Although His will be my eternal pain.
  I have no question:
  It is enough, I know what fixed the station
  Of star and cloud.
  And knowing all, I cry
  That what so God has willed
  On the instant be fulfilled,
  Though that be my damnation.
  The stream of the world has changed its course,
  And with the stream my thoughts have run
  Into some cloudy thunderous spring
  That is its mountain source -- 
  Aye, to some frenzy of the mind,
  For all that we have done's undone,
  Our speculation but as the wind.

                                                            _He dies._

FOOL

Wise man -- Wise man, wake up and I will tell you everything for a penny.
It is I, poor Teigue the Fool. Why don't you wake up, and say, `There
is a penny for you, Teigue`? No, no, you will say nothing. You and I,
we are the two fools, we know everything, but we will not speak.

                                      _Angel enters holding a casket._

O, look what has come from his mouth! O, look what has come from his
mouth -- the white butterfly! He is dead, and I have taken his soul in my
hands; but I know why you open the lid of that golden box. I must give
it to you. There then, (_he puts butterfly in casket_) he has gone
through his pains, and you will open the lid in the Garden of Paradise.
(_He closes curtain and remains outside it._) He is gone, he is gone,
he is gone, but come in, everybody in the world, and look at me.

  `I hear the wind a blow
  I hear the grass a grow,
  And all that I know, I know.`
  But I will not speak, I will run away.

                                                        _He goes out._


APPREHENSION

AND all hours long, the town
  Roars like a beast in a cave
That is wounded there
And like to drown;
  While days rush, wave after wave
On its lair.

An invisible woe unseals
  The flood, so it passes beyond
All bounds: the great old city
Recumbent roars as it feels
  The foamy paw of the pond
Reach from immensity.

But all that it can do
  Now, as the tide rises,
Is to listen and hear the grim
Waves crash like thunder through
  The splintered streets, hear noises
Roll hollow in the interim.


COMING AWAKE

WHEN I woke, the lake-lights were quivering on the
     wall,
The sunshine swam in a shoal across and across,
And a hairy, big bee hung over the primulas
In the window, his body black fur, and the sound
     of him cross.

There was something I ought to remember: and
     yet
I did not remember. Why should I? The running lights
And the airy primulas, oblivious-
Of the impending bee -- they were fair enough
     sights.


FROM A COLLEGE WINDOW

THE glimmer of the limes, sun-heavy, sleeping,
   Goes trembling past me up the College wall.
Below, the lawn, in soft blue shade is keeping,
   The daisy-froth quiescent, softly in thrall.

Beyond the leaves that overhang the street,
  Along the flagged, clean pavement summer-white,
Passes the world with shadows at their feet
   Going left and right.

Remote, although I hear the beggar's cough,
   See the woman's twinkling fingers tend him a
      coin,
I sit absolved, assured I am better off
   Beyond a world I never want to join.


FLAPPER

LOVE has crept out of her sealed heart
  As a field-bee, black and amber,
  Breaks from the winter-cell, to clamber
Up the warm grass where the sunbeams start.

Mischief has come in her dawning eyes,
  And a glint of coloured iris brings
  Such as lies along the folded wings
Of the bee before he flies.

Who, with a ruffling, careful breath,
  Has opened the wings of the wild young sprite?
  Has fluttered her spirit to stumbling flight
In her eyes, as a young bee stumbleth?

Love makes the burden of her voice.
  The hum of his heavy, staggering wings
  Sets quivering with wisdom the common
      things
That she says, and her words rejoice.


BIRDCAGE WALK

WHEN the wind blows her veil
  And uncovers her laughter
I cease, I turn pale.
When the wind blows her veil
From the woes I bewail
  Of love and hereafter:
When the wind blows her veil
I cease, I turn pale.


LETTER FROM TOWN: THE
ALMOND TREE

YOU promised to send me some violets. Did you
     forget?
  White ones and blue ones from under the orchard
     hedge?
  Sweet dark purple, and white ones mixed for a
     pledge
Of our early love that hardly has opened yet.

Here there's an almond tree -- you have never seen
  Such a one in the north -- it flowers on the street,
     and I stand
  Every day by the fence to look up for the flowers
     that expand
At rest in the blue, and wonder at what they mean.

Under the almond tree, the happy lands
  Provence, Japan, and Italy repose,
  And passing feet are chatter and clapping of
     those
Who play around us, country girls clapping their
     hands.

You, my love, the foremost, in a flowered gown,
  All your unbearable tenderness, you with the
     laughter
  Startled upon your eyes now so wide with hereafter,
You with loose hands of abandonment hanging
     down.


FLAT SUBURBS, S.W., IN THE
MORNING

THE new red houses spring like plants
      In level rows
Of reddish herbage that bristles and slants
      Its square shadows.

The pink young houses show one side bright
      Flatly assuming the sun,
And one side shadow, half in sight,
      Half-hiding the pavement-run;

Where hastening creatures pass intent
      On their level way,
Threading like ants that can never relent
      And have nothing to say.

Bare stems of street-lamps stiffly stand
      At random, desolate twigs,
To testify to a blight on the land
      That has stripped their sprigs.



THIEF IN THE NIGHT

LAST night a thief came to me
  And struck at me with something dark.
I cried, but no one could hear me,
  I lay dumb and stark.

When I awoke this morning
  I could find no trace;
Perhaps 'twas a dream of warning,
  For I've lost my peace.


LETTER FROM TOWN: ON A
GREY EVENING IN MARCH

THE clouds are pushing in grey reluctance slowly
     northward to you,
While north of them all, at the farthest ends,
     stands one bright-bosomed, aglance
With fire as it guards the wild north cloud-coasts,
     red-fire seas running through
The rocks where ravens flying to windward melt
     as a well-shot lance.

You should be out by the orchard, where violets
     secretly darken the earth,
Or there in the woods of the twilight, with
     northern wind-flowers shaken astir.
Think of me here in the library, trying and trying
     a song that is worth
Tears and swords to my heart, arrows no armour
     will turn or deter.

You tell me the lambs have come, they lie like
     daisies white in the grass
Of the dark-green hills; new calves in shed;
     peewits turn after the plough -- 
It is well for you. For me the navvies work in the
     road where I pass
And I want to smite in anger the barren rock of
     each waterless brow.

Like the sough of a wind that is caught up high in
     the mesh of the budding trees,
A sudden car goes sweeping past, and I strain my
     soul to hear
The voice of the furtive triumphant engine as it
     rushes past like a breeze,
To hear on its mocking triumphance unwitting
     the after-echo of fear.


SUBURBS ON A HAZY DAY

O STIFFLY shapen houses that change not,
  What conjuror's cloth was thrown across you,
     and raised
To show you thus transfigured, changed,
  Your stuff all gone, your menace almost rased?

Such resolute shapes, so harshly set
  In hollow blocks and cubes deformed, and heaped
In void and null profusion, how is this?
  In what strong _aqua regia_ now are you steeped?

That you lose the brick-stuff out of you
  And hover like a presentment, fading faint
And vanquished, evaporate away
  To leave but only the merest possible taint!


HYDE PARK AT NIGHT, BEFORE
THE WAR

_Clerks_.

WE have shut the doors behind us, and the velvet
    flowers of night
Lean about us scattering their pollen grains of
    golden light.

Now at last we lift our faces, and our faces come
    aflower
To the night that takes us willing, liberates us to the
    hour.

Now at last the ink and dudgeon passes from our
    fervent eyes
And out of the chambered weariness wanders a
    spirit abroad on its enterprise.

    Not too near and not too far
    Out of the stress of the crowd
    Music screams as elephants scream
    When they lift their trunks and scream aloud
    For joy of the night when masters are
           Asleep and adream.

    So here I hide in the Shalimar
    With a wanton princess slender and proud,
    And we swoon with kisses, swoon till we seem
    Two streaming peacocks gone in a cloud
    Of golden dust, with star after star
           On our stream.


GIPSY

I, THE man with the red scarf,
   Will give thee what I have, this last week's earnings.
Take them, and buy thee a silver ring
   And wed me, to ease my yearnings.

For the rest, when thou art wedded
   I'll wet my brow for thee
With sweat, I'll enter a house for thy sake,
   Thou shalt shut doors on me.


TWO-FOLD

How gorgeous that shock of red lilies, and larkspur
    cleaving
All with a flash of blue! -- when will she be leaving
Her room, where the night still hangs like a half-folded bat,
And passion unbearable seethes in the darkness, like
    must in a vat.


UNDER THE OAK

You, if you were sensible,
When I tell you the stars flash signals, each one
   dreadful,
You would not turn and answer me
The night is wonderful.

Even you, if you knew
How this darkness soaks me through and through,
   and infuses
Unholy fear in my vapour, you would pause to distinguish
What hurts, from what amuses.

For I tell you
Beneath this powerful tree, my whole soul's fluid
Oozes away from me as a sacrifice steam
At the knife of a Druid.

Again I tell you, I bleed, I am bound with withies,
My life runs out.
I tell you my blood runs out on the floor of this oak,
Gout upon gout.

Above me springs the blood-born mistletoe
In the shady smoke.
But who are you, twittering to and fro
Beneath the oak?

What thing better are you, what worse?
What have you to do with the mysteries
Of this ancient place, of my ancient curse?
What place have you in my histories?


SIGH NO MORE

THE cuckoo and the coo-dove's ceaseless calling,
               Calling,
Of a meaningless monotony is palling
All my morning's pleasure in the sun-fleck-scattered
     wood.
May-blossom and blue bird's-eye flowers falling,
               Falling
In a litter through the elm-tree shade are scrawling
Messages of true-love down the dust of the high-road.
I do not like to hear the gentle grieving,
               Grieving
Of the she-dove in the blossom, still believing
Love will yet again return to her and make all good.

When I know that there must ever be deceiving,
               Deceiving
Of the mournful constant heart, that while she's
     weaving
Her woes, her lover woos and sings within another
     wood.

Oh, boisterous the cuckoo shouts, forestalling,
               Stalling
A progress down the intricate enthralling
By-paths where the wanton-headed flowers doff
     their hood.

And like a laughter leads me onward, heaving,
               Heaving
A sigh among the shadows, thus retrieving
A decent short regret for that which once was very
     good.


LOVE STORM

MANY roses in the wind
Are tapping at the window-sash.
A hawk is in the sky; his wings
Slowly begin to plash.

The roses with the west wind rapping
Are torn away, and a splash
Of red goes down the billowing air.

Still hangs the hawk, with the whole sky moving
Past him -- only a wing-beat proving
The will that holds him there.

The daisies in the grass are bending,
The hawk has dropped, the wind is spending
All the roses, and unending
Rustle of leaves washes out the rending
Cry of a bird.

A red rose goes on the wind. -- Ascending
The hawk his wind-swept way is wending
Easily down the sky. The daisies, sending
Strange white signals, seem intending
To show the place whence the scream was heard.

But, oh, my heart, what birds are piping!
A silver wind is hastily wiping
The face of the youngest rose.

And oh, my heart, cease apprehending!
The hawk is gone, a rose is tapping
The window-sash as the west-wind blows.

Knock, knock, 'tis no more than a red rose rapping,
And fear is a plash of wings.
What, then, if a scarlet rose goes flapping
Down the bright-grey ruin of things!


PARLIAMENT HILL IN THE
EVENING

THE houses fade in a melt of mist
  Blotching the thick, soiled air
With reddish places that still resist
  The Night's slow care.

The hopeless, wintry twilight fades,
  The city corrodes out of sight
As the body corrodes when death invades
  That citadel of delight.

Now verdigris smoulderings softly spread
  Through the shroud of the town, as slow
Night-lights hither and thither shed
  Their ghastly glow.


PICCADILLY CIRCUS AT NIGHT

_Street-Walkers_.

WHEN into the night the yellow light is roused like
   dust above the towns,
Or like a mist the moon has kissed from off a pool in
   the midst of the downs,

Our faces flower for a little hour pale and uncertain
   along the street,
Daisies that waken all mistaken white-spread in expectancy to meet

The luminous mist which the poor things wist was
   dawn arriving across the sky,
When dawn is far behind the star the dust-lit town
   has driven so high.

All the birds are folded in a silent ball of sleep,
   All the flowers are faded from the asphalt isle in
      the sea,
Only we hard-faced creatures go round and round,
      and keep
   The shores of this innermost ocean alive and
      illusory.

Wanton sparrows that twittered when morning
      looked in at their eyes
   And the Cyprian's pavement-roses are gone, and
      now it is we
Flowers of illusion who shine in our gauds, make a
      Paradise
   On the shores of this ceaseless ocean, gay birds of
      the town-dark sea.


TARANTELLA

SAD as he sits on the white sea-stone
And the suave sea chuckles, and turns to the moon,
And the moon significant smiles at the cliffs and
   the boulders.
He sits like a shade by the flood alone
While I dance a tarantella on the rocks, and the
   croon
Of my mockery mocks at him over the waves'
   bright shoulders.

What can I do but dance alone,
Dance to the sliding sea and the moon,
For the moon on my breast and the air on my limbs
   and the foam on my feet?
For surely this earnest man has none
Of the night in his soul, and none of the tune
Of the waters within him; only the world's old
   wisdom to bleat.

I wish a wild sea-fellow would come down the
   glittering shingle,
A soulless neckar, with winking seas in his eyes
And falling waves in his arms, and the lost soul's kiss
On his lips: I long to be soulless, I tingle
To touch the sea in the last surprise
Of fiery coldness, to be gone in a lost soul's bliss.


IN CHURCH

IN the choir the boys are singing the hymn.
        The morning light on their lips
Moves in silver-moist flashes, in musical trim.

Sudden outside the high window, one crow
        Hangs in the air
And lights on a withered oak-tree's top of woe.

One bird, one blot, folded and still at the top
        Of the withered tree! -- in the grail
Of crystal heaven falls one full black drop.

Like a soft full drop of darkness it seems to sway
        In the tender wine
Of our Sabbath, suffusing our sacred day.


PIANO

Softly, in the dusk, a woman is singing to me;
Taking me back down the vista of years, till I see
A child sitting under the piano, in the boom of the
    tingling strings
And pressing the small, poised feet of a mother who
    smiles as she sings.

In spite of myself, the insidious mastery of song
Betrays me back, till the heart of me weeps to belong
To the old Sunday evenings at home, with winter
    outside
And hymns in the cosy parlour, the tinkling piano
    our guide.

So now it is vain for the singer to burst into clamour
With the great black piano appassionato. The
    glamour
Of childish days is upon me, my manhood is cast
Down in the flood of remembrance, I weep like a
    child for the past.


EMBANKMENT AT NIGHT,
BEFORE THE WAR

_Charity_.

BY the river
In the black wet night as the furtive rain slinks
    down,
Dropping and starting from sleep
Alone on a seat
A woman crouches.

I must go back to her.

I want to give her
Some money. Her hand slips out of the breast of
    her gown
Asleep. My fingers creep
Carefully over the sweet
Thumb-mound, into the palm's deep pouches.

So, the gift!

God, how she starts!
And looks at me, and looks in the palm of her hand!
And again at me!
I turn and run
Down the Embankment, run for my life.

But why? -- why?

Because of my heart's
Beating like sobs, I come to myself, and stand
In the street spilled over splendidly
With wet, flat lights. What I've done
I know not, my soul is in strife.

The touch was on the quick. I want to forget.


PHANTASMAGORIA

RIGID sleeps the house in darkness, I alone
Like a thing unwarrantable cross the hall
And climb the stairs to find the group of doors
Standing angel-stern and tall.

I want my own room's shelter. But what is this
Throng of startled beings suddenly thrown
In confusion against my entry? Is it only the trees'
Large shadows from the outside street lamp blown?

Phantom to phantom leaning; strange women weep
Aloud, suddenly on my mind
Startling a fear unspeakable, as the shuddering wind
Breaks and sobs in the blind.

So like to women, tall strange women weeping!
Why continually do they cross the bed?
Why does my soul contract with unnatural fear?
I am listening! Is anything said?

Ever the long black figures swoop by the bed;
They seem to be beckoning, rushing away, and
    beckoning.
Whither then, whither, what is it, say
What is the reckoning.

Tall black Bacchae of midnight, why then, why
Do you rush to assail me?
Do I intrude on your rites nocturnal?
What should it avail me?

Is there some great Iacchos of these slopes
Suburban dismal?
Have I profaned some female mystery, orgies
Black and phantasmal?


NEXT MORNING

How have I wandered here to this vaulted room
In the house of life? -- the floor was ruffled with gold
Last evening, and she who was softly in bloom,
Glimmered as flowers that in perfume at twilight
    unfold

For the flush of the night; whereas now the gloom
Of every dirty, must-besprinkled mould,
And damp old web of misery's heirloom
Deadens this day's grey-dropping arras-fold.

And what is this that floats on the undermist
Of the mirror towards the dusty grate, as if feeling
Unsightly its way to the warmth? -- this thing with
    a list
To the left? this ghost like a candle swealing?

Pale-blurred, with two round black drops, as if it
    missed
Itself among everything else, here hungrily stealing
Upon me! -- my own reflection! -- explicit gist
Of my presence there in the mirror that leans from
    the ceiling!

Then will somebody square this shade with the
    being I know
I was last night, when my soul rang clear as a bell
And happy as rain in summer? Why should it be
    so?
What is there gone against me, why am I in hell?


PALIMPSEST OF TWILIGHT

DARKNESS comes out of the earth
  And swallows dip into the pallor of the west;
From the hay comes the clamour of children's
     mirth;
Wanes the old palimpsest.

The night-stock oozes scent,
  And a moon-blue moth goes flittering by:
All that the worldly day has meant
  Wastes like a lie.

The children have forsaken their play;
  A single star in a veil of light
Glimmers: litter of day
  Is gone from sight.


EMBANKMENT AT NIGHT,
BEFORE THE WAR

_Outcasts_.

THE night rain, dripping unseen,
Comes endlessly kissing my face and my hands.

The river, slipping between
Lamps, is rayed with golden bands
Half way down its heaving sides;
Revealed where it hides.

Under the bridge
Great electric cars
Sing through, and each with a floor-light racing
    along at its side.
Far off, oh, midge after midge
Drifts over the gulf that bars
The night with silence, crossing the lamp-touched
    tide.

At Charing Cross, here, beneath the bridge
Sleep in a row the outcasts,
Packed in a line with their heads against the wall.
Their feet, in a broken ridge
Stretch out on the way, and a lout casts
A look as he stands on the edge of this naked stall.

Beasts that sleep will cover
Their faces in their flank; so these
Have huddled rags or limbs on the naked sleep.
Save, as the tram-cars hover
Past with the noise of a breeze
And gleam as of sunshine crossing the low black heap,

Two naked faces are seen
Bare and asleep,
Two pale clots swept and swept by the light of the
    cars.
Foam-clots showing between
The long, low tidal-heap,
The mud-weed opening two pale, shadowless stars.

Over the pallor of only two faces
Passes the gallivant beam of the trams;
Shows in only two sad places
The white bare bone of our shams.

A little, bearded man, pale, peaked in sleeping,
With a face like a chickweed flower.
And a heavy woman, sleeping still keeping
Callous and dour.

Over the pallor of only two places
Tossed on the low, black, ruffled heap
Passes the light of the tram as it races
Out of the deep.

Eloquent limbs
In disarray
Sleep-suave limbs of a youth with long, smooth
    thighs
Hutched up for warmth; the muddy rims
Of trousers fray
On the thin bare shins of a man who uneasily lies.

The balls of five red toes
As red and dirty, bare
Young birds forsaken and left in a nest of mud -- 
Newspaper sheets enclose
Some limbs like parcels, and tear
When the sleeper stirs or turns on the ebb of the
    flood -- 

One heaped mound
Of a woman's knees
As she thrusts them upward under the ruffled skirt -- 
And a curious dearth of sound
In the presence of these
Wastrels that sleep on the flagstones without any
    hurt.

Over two shadowless, shameless faces
Stark on the heap
Travels the light as it tilts in its paces
Gone in one leap.

At the feet of the sleepers, watching,
Stand those that wait
For a place to lie down; and still as they stand,
    they sleep,
Wearily catching
The flood's slow gait
Like men who are drowned, but float erect in the
    deep.

Oh, the singing mansions,
Golden-lighted tall
Trams that pass, blown ruddily down the night!
The bridge on its stanchions
Stoops like a pall
To this human blight.

On the outer pavement, slowly,
Theatre people pass,
Holding aloft their umbrellas that flash and are
    bright
Like flowers of infernal moly
Over nocturnal grass
Wetly bobbing and drifting away on our sight.

And still by the rotten
Row of shattered feet,
Outcasts keep guard.
Forgotten,
Forgetting, till fate shall delete
One from the ward.

The factories on the Surrey side
Are beautifully laid in black on a gold-grey sky.
The river's invisible tide
Threads and thrills like ore that is wealth to the eye.

And great gold midges
Cross the chasm
At the bridges
Above intertwined plasm.


WINTER IN THE BOULEVARD

THE frost has settled down upon the trees
And ruthlessly strangled off the fantasies
Of leaves that have gone unnoticed, swept like old
Romantic stories now no more to be told.

The trees down the boulevard stand naked in
    thought,
Their abundant summery wordage silenced, caught
In the grim undertow; naked the trees confront
Implacable winter's long, cross-questioning brunt.

Has some hand balanced more leaves in the depths
    of the twigs?
Some dim little efforts placed in the threads of the
    birch? -- 
It is only the sparrows, like dead black leaves on
    the sprigs,
Sitting huddled against the cerulean, one flesh with
    their perch.

The clear, cold sky coldly bethinks itself.
Like vivid thought the air spins bright, and all
Trees, birds, and earth, arrested in the after-thought
Awaiting the sentence out from the welkin brought.


SCHOOL ON THE OUTSKIRTS

How different, in the middle of snows, the great
     school rises red!
  A red rock silent and shadowless, clung round
     with clusters of shouting lads,
Some few dark-cleaving the doorway, souls that
     cling as the souls of the dead
  In stupor persist at the gates of life, obstinate
     dark monads.

This new red rock in a waste of white rises against
     the day
  With shelter now, and with blandishment, since
     the winds have had their way
And laid the desert horrific of silence and snow on
     the world of mankind,
  School now is the rock in this weary land the winter
     burns and makes blind.


SICKNESS

WAVING slowly before me, pushed into the dark,
Unseen my hands explore the silence, drawing the
    bark
Of my body slowly behind.

Nothing to meet my fingers but the fleece of night
Invisible blinding my face and my eyes! What if
    in their flight
My hands should touch the door!

What if I suddenly stumble, and push the door
Open, and a great grey dawn swirls over my feet,
    before
I can draw back!

What if unwitting I set the door of eternity wide
And am swept away in the horrible dawn, am gone
    down the tide
Of eternal hereafter!

Catch my hands, my darling, between your breasts.
Take them away from their venture, before fate
    wrests
The meaning out of them.


EVERLASTING FLOWERS

WHO do you think stands watching
  The snow-tops shining rosy
In heaven, now that the darkness
  Takes all but the tallest posy?

Who then sees the two-winged
  Boat down there, all alone
And asleep on the snow's last shadow,
  Like a moth on a stone?

The olive-leaves, light as gad-flies,
  Have all gone dark, gone black.
And now in the dark my soul to you
  Turns back.

To you, my little darling,
  To you, out of Italy.
For what is loveliness, my love,
  Save you have it with me!

So, there's an oxen wagon
  Comes darkly into sight:
A man with a lantern, swinging
  A little light.

What does he see, my darling
  Here by the darkened lake?
Here, in the sloping shadow
  The mountains make?

He says not a word, but passes,
  Staring at what he sees.
What ghost of us both do you think he saw
  Under the olive trees?

All the things that are lovely -- 
  The things you never knew -- 
I wanted to gather them one by one
  And bring them to you.

But never now, my darling
  Can I gather the mountain-tips
From the twilight like half-shut lilies
  To hold to your lips.

And never the two-winged vessel
  That sleeps below on the lake
Can I catch like a moth between my hands
  For you to take.

But hush, I am not regretting:
  It is far more perfect now.
I'll whisper the ghostly truth to the world
  And tell them how

I know you here in the darkness,
  How you sit in the throne of my eyes
At peace, and look out of the windows
  In glad surprise.


THE NORTH COUNTRY

IN another country, black poplars shake themselves over a pond,
And rooks and the rising smoke-waves scatter and
    wheel from the works beyond;
The air is dark with north and with sulphur, the
    grass is a darker green,
And people darkly invested with purple move
   palpable through the scene.

Soundlessly down across the counties, out of the
    resonant gloom
That wraps the north in stupor and purple travels
    the deep, slow boom
Of the man-life north-imprisoned, shut in the hum
    of the purpled steel
As it spins to sleep on its motion, drugged dense in
    the sleep of the wheel.

Out of the sleep, from the gloom of motion, soundlessly, somnambule
Moans and booms the soul of a people imprisoned,
    asleep in the rule
Of the strong machine that runs mesmeric, booming
    the spell of its word
Upon them and moving them helpless, mechanic,
    their will to its will deferred.

Yet all the while comes the droning inaudible, out
    of the violet air,
The moaning of sleep-bound beings in travail that
    toil and are will-less there
In the spell-bound north, convulsive now with a
    dream near morning, strong
With violent achings heaving to burst the sleep
    that is now not long.


BITTERNESS OF DEATH

AH, stern, cold man,
How can you lie so relentless hard
While I wash you with weeping water!
Do you set your face against the daughter
Of life? Can you never discard
Your curt pride's ban?

You masquerader!
How can you shame to act this part
Of unswerving indifference to me?
You want at last, ah me!
To break my heart
Evader!

You know your mouth
Was always sooner to soften
Even than your eyes.
Now shut it lies
Relentless, however often
I kiss it in drouth.

It has no breath
Nor any relaxing. Where,
Where are you, what have you done?
What is this mouth of stone?
How did you dare
Take cover in death!



Once you could see,
The white moon show like a breast revealed
By the slipping shawl of stars.
Could see the small stars tremble
As the heart beneath did wield
Systole, diastole.

All the lovely macrocosm
Was woman once to you,
Bride to your groom.
No tree in bloom
But it leaned you a new
White bosom.

And always and ever
Soft as a summering tree
Unfolds from the sky, for your good,
Unfolded womanhood;
Shedding you down as a tree
Sheds its flowers on a river.

I saw your brows
Set like rocks beside a sea of gloom,
And I shed my very soul down into your
   thought;
Like flowers I fell, to be caught
On the comforted pool, like bloom
That leaves the boughs.



Oh, masquerader,
With a hard face white-enamelled,
What are you now?
Do you care no longer how
My heart is trammelled,
Evader?

Is this you, after all,
Metallic, obdurate
With bowels of steel?
Did you _never_ feel? -- 
Cold, insensate,
Mechanical!

Ah, no! -- you multiform,
You that I loved, you wonderful,
You who darkened and shone,
You were many men in one;
But never this null
This never-warm!

Is this the sum of you?
Is it all nought?
Cold, metal-cold?
Are you all told
Here, iron-wrought?
Is _this_ what's become of you?


SEVEN SEALS

SINCE this is the last night I keep you home,
Come, I will consecrate you for the journey.

Rather I had you would not go. Nay come,
I will not again reproach you. Lie back
And let me love you a long time ere you go.
For you are sullen-hearted still, and lack
The will to love me. But even so
I will set a seal upon you from my lip,
Will set a guard of honour at each door,
Seal up each channel out of which might slip
Your love for me.

                 I kiss your mouth. Ah, love,
Could I but seal its ruddy, shining spring
Of passion, parch it up, destroy, remove
Its softly-stirring crimson welling-up
Of kisses! Oh, help me, God! Here at the source
I'd lie for ever drinking and drawing in
Your fountains, as heaven drinks from out their
    course
The floods.

                 I close your ears with kisses
And seal your nostrils; and round your neck you'll
    wear -- 
Nay, let me work -- a delicate chain of kisses.
Like beads they go around, and not one misses
To touch its fellow on either side.

                 And there
Full mid-between the champaign of your breast
I place a great and burning seal of love
Like a dark rose, a mystery of rest
On the slow bubbling of your rhythmic heart.

Nay, I persist, and very faith shall keep
You integral to me. Each door, each mystic port
Of egress from you I will seal and steep
In perfect chrism.
          Now it is done. The mort
Will sound in heaven before it is undone.

But let me finish what I have begun
And shirt you now invulnerable in the mail
Of iron kisses, kisses linked like steel.
Put greaves upon your thighs and knees, and frail
Webbing of steel on your feet. So you shall feel
Ensheathed invulnerable with me, with seven
Great seals upon your outgoings, and woven
Chain of my mystic will wrapped perfectly
Upon you, wrapped in indomitable me.


READING A LETTER

SHE sits on the recreation ground
  Under an oak whose yellow buds dot the pale
     blue sky.
The young grass twinkles in the wind, and the sound
  Of the wind in the knotted buds in a canopy.

So sitting under the knotted canopy
  Of the wind, she is lifted and carried away as in
    a balloon
Across the insensible void, till she stoops to see
  The sandy desert beneath her, the dreary platoon.

She knows the waste all dry beneath her, in one
     place
  Stirring with earth-coloured life, ever turning and
     stirring.
But never the motion has a human face
  Nor sound, save intermittent machinery whirring.

And so again, on the recreation ground
  She alights a stranger, wondering, unused to the
     scene;
Suffering at sight of the children playing around,
  Hurt at the chalk-coloured tulips, and the evening-green.


TWENTY YEARS AGO

ROUND the house were lilacs and strawberries
  And foal-foots spangling the paths,
And far away on the sand-hills, dewberries
  Caught dust from the sea's long swaths.

Up the wolds the woods were walking,
  And nuts fell out of their hair.
At the gate the nets hung, balking
  The star-lit rush of a hare.

In the autumn fields, the stubble
  Tinkled the music of gleaning.
At a mother's knees, the trouble
  Lost all its meaning.

Yea, what good beginnings
  To this sad end!
Have we had our innings?
  God forfend!


INTIME

RETURNING, I find her just the same,
At just the same old delicate game.

Still she says: Nay, loose no flame
To lick me up and do me harm!
Be all yourself! -- for oh, the charm
Of your heart of fire in which I look!
Oh, better there than in any book
Glow and enact the dramas and dreams
I love for ever! -- there it seems
You are lovelier than life itself, till desire
Comes licking through the bars of your lips
And over my face the stray fire slips,
Leaving a burn and an ugly smart
That will have the oil of illusion. Oh, heart
Of fire and beauty, loose no more
Your reptile flames of lust; ah, store
Your passion in the basket of your soul,
Be all yourself, one bonny, burning coal
That stays with steady joy of its own fire.
But do not seek to take me by desire.
Oh, do not seek to thrust on me your fire!
For in the firing all my porcelain
Of flesh does crackle and shiver and break in pain,
My ivory and marble black with stain,
My veil of sensitive mystery rent in twain,
My altars sullied, I, bereft, remain
A priestess execrable, taken in vain -- 

                         So the refrain
Sings itself over, and so the game
Re-starts itself wherein I am kept
Like a glowing brazier faintly blue of flame
So that the delicate love-adept
Can warm her hands and invite her soul,
Sprinkling incense and salt of words
And kisses pale, and sipping the toll
Of incense-smoke that rises like birds.

Yet I've forgotten in playing this game,
Things I have known that shall have no name;
Forgetting the place from which I came
I watch her ward away the flame,
Yet warm herself at the fire -- then blame
Me that I flicker in the basket;
Me that I glow not with content
To have my substance so subtly spent;
Me that I interrupt her game.
I ought to be proud that she should ask it
Of me to be her fire-opal -- .

                         It is well
Since I am here for so short a spell
Not to interrupt her? -- Why should I
Break in by making any reply!


TWO WIVES



INTO the shadow-white chamber silts the white
Flux of another dawn. The wind that all night
Long has waited restless, suddenly wafts
A whirl like snow from the plum-trees and the pear,
Till petals heaped between the window-shafts
            In a drift die there.

A nurse in white, at the dawning, flower-foamed
   pane
Draws down the blinds, whose shadows scarcely
   stain
The white rugs on the floor, nor the silent bed
That rides the room like a frozen berg, its crest
Finally ridged with the austere line of the dead
            Stretched out at rest.

Less than a year the fourfold feet had pressed
The peaceful floor, when fell the sword on their rest.
Yet soon, too soon, she had him home again
With wounds between them, and suffering like a
   guest
That will not go. Now suddenly going, the pain
            Leaves an empty breast.



A tall woman, with her long white gown aflow
As she strode her limbs amongst it, once more
She hastened towards the room. Did she know
As she listened in silence outside the silent door?
Entering, she saw him in outline, raised on a pyre
            Awaiting the fire.

Upraised on the bed, with feet erect as a bow,
Like the prow of a boat, his head laid back like the
   stern
Of a ship that stands in a shadowy sea of snow
With frozen rigging, she saw him; she drooped like
   a fern
Refolding, she slipped to the floor as a ghost-white
   peony slips
            When the thread clips.

Soft she lay as a shed flower fallen, nor heard
The ominous entry, nor saw the other love,
The dark, the grave-eyed mistress who thus dared
At such an hour to lay her claim, above
A stricken wife, so sunk in oblivion, bowed
            With misery, no more proud.



The stranger's hair was shorn like a lad's dark poll
And pale her ivory face: her eyes would fail
In silence when she looked: for all the whole
Darkness of failure was in them, without avail.
Dark in indomitable failure, she who had lost
            Now claimed the host,

She softly passed the sorrowful flower shed
In blonde and white on the floor, nor even turned
Her head aside, but straight towards the bed
Moved with slow feet, and her eyes' flame steadily
   burned.
She looked at him as he lay with banded cheek,
            And she started to speak

Softly: I knew it would come to this, she said,
I knew that some day, soon, I should find you thus.
So I did not fight you. You went your way instead
Of coming mine -- and of the two of us
I died the first, I, in the after-life
            Am now your wife.



'Twas I whose fingers did draw up the young
Plant of your body: to me you looked e'er sprung
The secret of the moon within your eyes!
My mouth you met before your fine red mouth
Was set to song -- and never your song denies
            My love, till you went south.

'Twas I who placed the bloom of manhood on
Your youthful smoothness: I fleeced where fleece
   was none
Your fervent limbs with flickers and tendrils of new
Knowledge; I set your heart to its stronger beat;
I put my strength upon you, and I threw
            My life at your feet.

But I whom the years had reared to be your bride,
Who for years was sun for your shivering, shade for
   your sweat,
Who for one strange year was as a bride to you -- you
   set me aside
With all the old, sweet things of our youth; -- and
   never yet
Have I ceased to grieve that I was not great enough
            To defeat your baser stuff.



But you are given back again to me
Who have kept intact for you your virginity.
Who for the rest of life walk out of care,
Indifferent here of myself, since I am gone
Where you are gone, and you and I out there
            Walk now as one.

Your widow am I, and only I. I dream
God bows his head and grants me this supreme
Pure look of your last dead face, whence now is gone
The mobility, the panther's gambolling,
And all your being is given to me, so none
            Can mock my struggling.

And now at last I kiss your perfect face,
Perfecting now our unfinished, first embrace.
Your young hushed look that then saw God ablaze
In every bush, is given you back, and we
Are met at length to finish our rest of days
            In a unity.


HEIMWEH

FAR-OFF the lily-statues stand white-ranked in the
    garden at home.
Would God they were shattered quickly, the cattle
    would tread them out in the loam.
I wish the elder trees in flower could suddenly heave,
    and burst
The walls of the house, and nettles puff out from
    the hearth at which I was nursed.

It stands so still in the hush composed of trees and
    inviolate peace,
The home of my fathers, the place that is mine, my
    fate and my old increase.
And now that the skies are falling, the world is
    spouting in fountains of dirt,
I would give my soul for the homestead to fall with
    me, go with me, both in one hurt.


DEBACLE

THE trees in trouble because of autumn,
  And scarlet berries falling from the bush,
And all the myriad houseless seeds
  Loosing hold in the wind's insistent push

Moan softly with autumnal parturition,
  Poor, obscure fruits extruded out of light
Into the world of shadow, carried down
  Between the bitter knees of the after-night.

Bushed in an uncouth ardour, coiled at core
  With a knot of life that only bliss can unravel,
Fall all the fruits most bitterly into earth
  Bitterly into corrosion bitterly travel.

What is it internecine that is locked,
  By very fierceness into a quiescence
Within the rage? We shall not know till it burst
  Out of corrosion into new florescence.

Nay, but how tortured is the frightful seed
  The spark intense within it, all without
Mordant corrosion gnashing and champing hard
  For ruin on the naked small redoubt.

Bitter, to fold the issue, and make no sally;
  To have the mystery, but not go forth;
To bear, but retaliate nothing, given to save
  The spark in storms of corrosion, as seeds from
     the north.

The sharper, more horrid the pressure, the harder
     the heart
  That saves the blue grain of eternal fire
Within its quick, committed to hold and wait
  And suffer unheeding, only forbidden to expire.


NARCISSUS

WHERE the minnows trace
A glinting web quick hid in the gloom of the brook,
When I think of the place
And remember the small lad lying intent to look
Through the shadowy face
At the little fish thread-threading the watery nook -- 

It seems to me
The woman you are should be nixie, there is a pool
Where we ought to be.
You undine-clear and pearly, soullessly cool
And waterly
The pool for my limbs to fathom, my soul's last
    school.

Narcissus
Ventured so long ago in the deeps of reflection.
Illyssus
Broke the bounds and beyond! -- Dim recollection
Of fishes
Soundlessly moving in heaven's other direction!

Be
Undine towards the waters, moving back;
For me
A pool! Put off the soul you've got, oh lack
Your human self immortal; take the watery track.


AUTUMN SUNSHINE

THE sun sets out the autumn crocuses
  And fills them up a pouring measure
  Of death-producing wine, till treasure
Runs waste down their chalices.

All, all Persephone's pale cups of mould
  Are on the board, are over-filled;
  The portion to the gods is spilled;
Now, mortals all, take hold!

The time is now, the wine-cup full and full
  Of lambent heaven, a pledging-cup;
  Let now all mortal men take up
The drink, and a long, strong pull.

Out of the hell-queen's cup, the heaven's pale wine -- 
  Drink then, invisible heroes, drink.
  Lips to the vessels, never shrink,
Throats to the heavens incline.

And take within the wine the god's great oath
  By heaven and earth and hellish stream
  To break this sick and nauseous dream
We writhe and lust in, both.

Swear, in the pale wine poured from the cups of the
       queen
  Of hell, to wake and be free
  From this nightmare we writhe in,
Break out of this foul has-been.


ON THAT DAY

   ON that day
I shall put roses on roses, and cover your grave
With multitude of white roses: and since you were
      brave
   One bright red ray.

   So people, passing under
The ash-trees of the valley-road, will raise
Their eyes and look at the grave on the hill, in
      wonder,
   Wondering mount, and put the flowers asunder

   To see whose praise
Is blazoned here so white and so bloodily red.
Then they will say: 'Tis long since she is dead,
   Who has remembered her after many days?

   And standing there
They will consider how you went your ways
Unnoticed among them, a still queen lost in the
      maze
   Of this earthly affair.

   A queen, they'll say,
Has slept unnoticed on a forgotten hill.
Sleeps on unknown, unnoticed there, until
   Dawns my insurgent day.

Irradiations; Sand and Spray
  IRRADIATIONS
  The spattering of the rain upon pale terraces
  Of afternoon is like the passing of a dream
  Amid the roses shuddering 'gainst the wet green stalks
  Of the streaming trees -- the passing of the wind
  Upon the pale lower terraces of my dream
  Is like the crinkling of the wet grey robes
  Of the hours that come to turn over the urn
  Of the day and spill its rainy dream.
  Vague movement over the puddled terraces:
  Heavy gold pennons -- a pomp of solemn gardens
  Half hidden under the liquid veil of spring:
  Far trumpets like a vague rout of faded roses
  Burst 'gainst the wet green silence of distant forests:
  A clash of cymbals -- then the swift swaying footsteps
  Of the wind that undulates along the languid terraces.
  Pools of rain -- the vacant terraces
  Wet, chill and glistening
  Towards the sunset beyond the broken doors of to-day.




  Gaunt sails -- bronze boats of the evening -- 
  Float along the river where aloft
  Like dim swans the clouds die
  Softly.

  I am afraid to traverse the long still streets of evening;
  For I fear to see the ghosts that stare at me
  From the shadows.
  I will stay indoors instead and await my wandering dream.

  She is about me, fluid yet, and formless;
  The wind in her hair whispers like dim violins:
  And the faint glint of her eyes shifts like a sudden movement
  Over the surface of a dark pool.

  She comes to me slowly down the lost streets of the evening,
  And their immutable silence is in her feet.
  Let no lamps flare -- be still, my heart -- hands, stay:
  For I would touch the lips of my new love with my lips.


  

  In the grey skirts of the fog seamews skirl desolately,
  And flick like bits of paper propelled by a wind
  About the flabby sails of a departing ship
  Crawling slowly down the low reaches
  Of the river.
  About the keel there is a bubbling and gurgling
  Of grumpy water;
  And as the prow noses out a way for itself,
  It seems to weave a dream of bubbles and flashing foam,
  A dream of strange islands whereto it is bound:
  Pear-islands drenched with the dawn.
  The palms flash under the immense dark sky,
  Down which the sun dives to embrace the earth:
  Drums boom and conches bray,
  And with a crash of crimson cymbals
  Suddenly appears above the polished backs of slaves
  A king in a breastplate of gold
  Gigantic
  Amid tossed roses and swaying dancers
  That melt into pale undulations and muffled echoes
 'Mid the bubbling of the muddy lumpy water,
  And the swirling of the seamews above the sullen river.


  The iridescent vibrations of midsummer light
  Dancing, dancing, suddenly flickering and quivering
  Like little feet or the movement of quick hands clapping,
  Or the rustle of furbelows or the clash of polished gems.
  The palpitant mosaic of the midday light
  Colliding, sliding, leaping and lingering:
  O, I could lie on my back all day,
  And mark the mad ballet of the midsummer sky.



  Over the roof-tops race the shadows of clouds;
  Like horses the shadows of clouds charge down the street.

  Whirlpools of purple and gold,
  Winds from the mountains of cinnabar,
  Lacquered mandarin moments, palanquins swaying and balancing
  Amid the vermilion pavilions, against the jade balustrades.
  Glint of the glittering wings of dragon-flies in the light:
  Silver filaments, golden flakes settling downwards,
  Rippling, quivering flutters, repulse and surrender,
  The sun broidered upon the rain,
  The rain rustling with the sun.

  Over the roof-tops race the shadows of clouds;
  Like horses the shadows of clouds charge down the street.



  The balancing of gaudy broad pavilions
  Of summer against the insolent breeze:
  The bellying of the sides of striped tents,
  Swelling taut, shuddering in quick collapse,
  Silent under the silence of the sky.

  Earth is streaked and spotted
  With great splashes and dapples of sunlight:
  The sun throws an immense circle of hot light upon the world,
  Rolling slowly in ponderous rhythm
  Darkly, musically forward.

  All is silent under the steep cone of afternoon:
  The sky is imperturbably profound.
  The ultimate divine union seems about to be accomplished,
  All is troubled at the attainment
  Of the inexhaustible infinite.

  The rolling and the tossing of the sides of immense pavilions
  Under the whirling wind that screams up the cloudless sky.



  Flickering of incessant rain
  On flashing pavements:
  Sudden scurry of umbrellas:
  Bending, recurved blossoms of the storm.

  The winds came clanging and clattering
  From long white highroads whipping in ribbons up summits:
  They strew upon the city gusty wafts of appleblossom,
  And the rustling of innumerable translucent leaves.

  Uneven tinkling, the lazy rain
  Dripping from the eaves.




  The fountain blows its breathless spray
  From me to you and back to me.

  Whipped, tossed, curdled,
  Crashing, quivering:
  I hurl kisses like blows upon your lips.
  The dance of a bee drunken with sunlight:
  Irradiant ecstasies, white and gold,
  Sigh and relapse.

  The fountain tosses pallid spray
  Far in the sorrowful, silent sky.




  The houses of the city no longer hum and play:
  They lie like careless drowsy giants, dumb, estranged.

  One presses to his breast his toy, a lighted pane:
  One stirs uneasily: one is cold in death.

  And the late moon, fearfully peering over an immense shoulder,
  Sees, in the shadow below, the unpeopled hush of a street.


 

  The trees, like great jade elephants,
  Chained, stamp and shake 'neath the gadflies of the breeze
  The trees lunge and plunge, unruly elephants:
  The clouds are their crimson howdah-canopies,
  The sunlight glints like the golden robe of a Shah.
  Would I were tossed on the wrinkled backs of those trees




  The clouds are like a sombre sea:
  On shining screens of ebony
  Are carven marvels of my heart.

  'Gainst crimson placques of cinnabar
  Shrills, like a diamond, dawn's last star.

  The gardens of my heart are green:
  The rain drips off the glistening leaves.
  In the humid gardens of my soul,
  The crimson peonies explode.

  I am like a drop of rose-flushed rain,
  Clinging to crimson petals of love.

  In the afternoon, over gold screens,
  I will brush the blue dust of my dreams.




  The pine, rough-bearded Pan of the woods
  Whispered in my ear his sleepy-sweet song.
  Like liquid fire it ran through my veins.
  Thus he piped: Sad, lonely son of the woods,
  Lie down in the long still grass and sleep,
  Ere the dawn has hidden her swelling breasts,
  Ere the morning has covered her massive flanks,
  With the flame-coloured mantle of noon.
  Lie down in the dewless grass nor awake
  To see whether afternoon has hurried in
  From the rim of her purple robe dropping dim flowers
  Golden flowers with pollen-dusty cups,
  Flowers of silence. Heed not though eve
  Should sail, a grey swan, in the pool of the sky,
  Spreading low ripples. Heed these not!
  Only awake when slim twilight
  Plunges her body in the last blown spray of the sun!
  Awake, then, for twilight and dawn are your day:
  Therefore lie down in the long dim grass and sleep,
  And I will blow my low pipes over you.




  As I went through the city by day
  I saw shadows in sunlight:
  But in the night I saw everywhere
  Stars within the darkness.

  (A coldly fluting breeze:
  Dark Pan under the trees.
  Low laughter: up the sky
  A star like a street-lamp left on high.)

  As I went through the city by day
  I was hustled by jostling people.
  But in the night, the wind of the darkness
  Whispered, "Hush!" to my soul.


  Brown bed of earth, still fresh and warm with love,
  Now hold me tight:
  Broad field of sky, where the clouds laughing move,
  Fill up my pores with light:
  You trees, now talk to me, chatter and scold or weep,
  Or drowsing stand:
  You winds, now play with me, you wild things creep,
  You boulders, bruise my hand!
  I now am yours and you are mine: it matters not
  What Gods herein I see:
  You grow in me, I am rooted to this spot,
  We drink and pass the cup, immortally.

  O seeded grass, you army of little men
  Crawling up the long slope with quivering, quick blades of steel:
  You who storm millions of graves, tiny green tentacles of Earth,
  Interlace yourselves tightly over my heart,
  And do not let me go:
  For I would lie here forever and watch with one eye
  The pilgrimaging ants in your dull, savage jungles,
  The while with the other I see the stiff lines of the slope
  Break in mid-air, a wave surprisingly arrested,
  And above them, wavering, dancing, bodiless, colourless, unreal,
  The long thin lazy fingers of the heat.



  An ant crawling up a grass-blade,
  And above it, the sky.
  I shall remember these when I die:
  An ant and a butterfly
  And the sky.

  The grass is full of forget-me-nots and poppies:
  Through the air darts many a fly.
  The ant toils up its grass-blade,
  The careless hours go by.

  The grass-blades bow to the feet of the lazy hours:
  They walk out of the wood, showering shadows on flowers.
  Their robes flutter vaguely far off there in the clearing:
  I see them sometimes from the corner of my eye.




  The wind that drives the fine dry sand
  Across the strand:
  The sad wind spinning arabesques
  With a wrinkled hand.

  Labyrinths of shifting sand,
  The dancing dunes!

  I will arise and run with the sand,
  And gather it greedily in my hand:
  I will wriggle like a long yellow snake over the beaches.
  I will lie curled up, sleeping,
  And the wind shall chase me
  Far inland.

  My breath is the music of the mad wind;
  Shrill piping, stamping of drunken feet,
  The fluttering, tattered broidery flung
  Over the dunes' steep escarpments.

  The fine dry sand that whistles
  Down the long low beaches.




  Blue, brown, blue: sky, sand, sea:
  I swell to your immensity.
  I will run over the endless beach,
  I will shout to the breaking spray,
  I will touch the sky with my fingers.
  My happiness is like this sand:
  I let it run out of my hand.



  The clouds pass
  Over the polished mirror of the sky:
  The clouds pass, puffs of grey,
  There is no star.

  The clouds pass slowly:
  Suddenly a disengaged star flashes.
  The night is cold and the clouds
  Roll slowly over the sky.




  I dance:
  I exist in motion:
  A wind-shaken flower spilling my drops in the sunlight.

  I feel the muscles bending, relaxing beneath me;
  I direct the rippling sweep of the lines of my body;
  Its impact crashes through the thin walls of the atmosphere,
  I dance.

  About me whirls
  The sombre hall, the gaudy stage, the harsh glare of the footlights,
  And in the brains of thousands watching
  Little flames leap quivering to the music of my effort.

  I have danced:
  I have expressed my soul
  In unbroken rhythm,
  Sorrow, and flame.
  I am tired: I would be extinguished beneath your beating hands.




  Not noisily, but solemnly and pale,
  In a meditative ecstasy you entered life:
  As performing some strange rite, to which you alone held the clue.
  Child, life did not give rude strength to you;
  from the beginning, you would seem to have thrown away,
  As something cold and cumbersome, that armour men use against death.
  You would perhaps look on him face to face, and so learn the secret
  Whether that face wears oftenest a smile or no?
  Strange, old, and silent being, there is something
  Infinitely vast in your intense tininess:
  I think you could point out, with a smile, some curious star
  Far off in the heavens, which no man has seen before.




  The morning is clean and blue and the wind blows up the clouds:
  Now my thoughts gathered from afar
  Once again in their patched armour, with rusty plumes and blunted swords,
  Move out to war.

  Smoking our morning pipes we shall ride two and two
  Through the woods.
  For our old cause keeps us together,
  And our hatred is so precious not death or defeat can break it.

  God willing, we shall this day meet that old enemy
  Who has given us so many a good beating.
  Thank God we have a cause worth fighting for,
  And a cause worth losing and a good song to sing.




  Torridly the moon rolls upward
  Against the smooth immensity of midsummer sky,
  Changeless, inexhaustible:
  The city beneath is still:
  Heaven and Earth are clasped together,
  Momently life grows as careless
  As the life of the intense stars.
  Out of the houses climbing,
  Fuming up windows, flickering from every roof-top,
  Rigid on sonorous pinnacles,
  Silently swirl aloft
  Love's infinite flamelets.



  O all you stars up yonder,
  Do you hear me? Beautiful, winking, sullen eyes,
  I am tired of seeing you in the same old places,
  Night after night in the sky.
  I hoped you would dance -- but after twenty-six years,
  I find you are determined to stay as you are.
  So I make it known to you, stars clustered or solitary,
  That I want you to fall into my lap to-night.
  Come down, little stars, let me play with you:
  I will string you like beads, and shovel you together,
  And wear you in my ears, and scatter you over people -- 
  And toss you back, like apples, if I choose.



  As I wandered over the city through the night,
  I saw many strange things:
  But I have forgotten all
  Except one painted face.
  Gaudy, shameless night-orchid,
  Heavy, flushed, sticky with narcotic perfume,
  There was something in you which made me prefer you
  Above all the feeble forget-me-nots of the world.
  You were neither burnt out nor pallid,
  There was plain, coarse, vulgar meaning in every line of you
  And no make-believe:
  You were at least alive,
  When all the rest were but puppets of the night.




  Slowly along the lamp-emblazoned street,
  Amid the last sad drifting crowds of midnight
  Like lost souls wandering,
  Comes marching by solemnly
  As for some gem-bedecked ritual of old,
  A monotonous procession of black carts
  Full crowded with blood-red blossom:
  Scarlet geraniums
  Unfolding their fiery globes upon the night.
  These are the memories of day moulded in jagged flame:
  Lust, joy, blood, and death.
  With crushed hands, weary eyes, and hoarse clamour,
  We consecrate and acclaim them tumultuously
  Ere they pass, contemptuous, beyond the unpierced veil of silence.


  I think there was an hour in which God laughed at me,
  For as I passed along the street,
  saw that all the women -- although their bodies were dexterously concealed -- 
  Were thinking with all their might what men were like:
  And the men, mechanically correct, cigars at lips,
  Were wanting to rush at the women,
  But were restrained by respectability or timidity,
  Or fear of the consequences or vanity or some puerile dream
  Of a pale ideal lost in the vast grey sky.
  So I said to myself, it is time to end all this:
  I will take the first woman that comes along.
  And then God laughed at me -- and I too smiled
  To see that He was in such good humour and that the sun was shining.



  I remember, there was a day
  During which I did not write a line of verse:
  Nor did I speak a word to any woman,
  Nor did I meet with death.

  Yet all that day I was fully occupied:
  My eyes saw trees, clouds, streets, houses, people;
  My lungs breathed air;
  My mouth swallowed food and drink;
  My hands seized things, my feet touched earth,
  Or spurned it at my desire.

  On that day I know I would have been sufficiently happy,
  If I could have kept my brain from bothering at all
  About my next trite poem;
  About the tedious necessities of sex;
  And about the day on which I would at last meet death.



  It is evening, and the earth
  Wraps her shoulders in an old blue shawl.
  Afar off there clink the polychrome points of the stars,
  Indefatigable, after all these years!
  Here upon earth there is life, and then death,
  Dawn, and later nightfall,
  Fire, and the quenching of embers:
  But why should I not remember that my night is dawn in another part of
       the world,
  If the idea fits my fancy?
  Dawns of marvellous light, wakeful, sleepy, weary, dancing dawns,
  You are rose petals settling through the blue of my evening:
  I light my pipe to salute you,
  And sit puffing smoke in the air and never say a word.



  I have seemed often feeble and useless to myself,
  And many times I have wished that the tedium of my life
  Lay at last dissolved in the cold acid of death:
  Yet I have not forgotten
  The sparkling of waters in the sunlight,
  The sound of a woman's voice,
  Gliding dancers,
  Chanting worshippers,
  A child crying,
  The wind amid the hills.
  These I can remember,
  And I think they are more of me
  Than the wrinkles on my face and the hungry ache at my heart.



  My stiff-spread arms
  Break into sudden gesture;
  My feet seize upon the rhythm;
  My hands drag it upwards:
  Thus I create the dance.

  I drink of the red bowl of the sunlight:
  I swim through seas of rain:
  I dig my toes into earth:
  I taste the smack of the wind:
  I am myself:
  I live.

  The temples of the gods are forgotten or in ruins:
  Professors are still arguing about the past and the future:
  I am sick of reading marginal notes on life,
  I am weary of following false banners:
  I desire nothing more intensely or completely than this present;
  There is nothing about me you are more likely to notice than my being:
  Let me therefore rejoice silently,
  A golden butterfly glancing against an unflecked wall.




  Today you shall have but little song from me,
  For I belong to the sunlight.
  This I would not barter for any kingdom.

  I am a wheeling swallow,
  Blue all over is my delight.
  I am a drowsy grass-blade
  In the greenest shadow.




  My desire goes bristling and growling like an angry leopard;
  My ribs are a hollow grating, my hair is coarse and hard,
  My flanks are like sharp iron wedges, my eyes glitter as chill glass;
  Down below there are the meadows where my famished hopes are feeding,
  I will waylay them to windward, stalking in watchful patience,
  I will pounce upon them, plunging my muzzle in the hot spurt of their
       blood.




  The flag let loose for a day of festivity;
  Free desperate symbol of battle and desire,
  Leaping, lunging, tossing up the halyards;
  Below it a tumult of music,
  Above it the streaming wastes of the sky,
  Pinnacles of clouds, pyres of dawn,
  Infinite effort, everlasting day.
  The immense flag waving
  Aloft in glory:
  Over seas and hilltops
  Transmitting its lightnings.



  What weave you, what spin you,
  What wonder win you,
  You looms of desire?
  Sin that is splendour,
  Love that is shameless,
  Life that is glory,
  Life that is all.




  Like cataracts that crash from a crumbling crag
  Into the dull-blue smouldering gulf of a lake below,
  Landlocked amid the mountains, so my soul
  Was a gorge that was filled with the warring echoes of song.

  Of old, they wore
  Shining armour, and banners of broad gold they bore:
  Now they drift, like a wild bird's cry,
  Downwards from chill summits of the sky.
  Fountains of flashing joy were their source afar;
  Now they lie still, to mirror every star.
  In circles of opal, ruby, blue, out-thrown,
  They drift down to a dull, dark monotone.

  Pluck the loose strings, singer,
  Thrum the strings;
  For the wind brings distant, drowsy bells of song.
  Loose the plucked string, poet,
  Spurn the strings,
  For the echoes of memory float through the gulf for long.

  My songs seem now one humming note afar:
  Light as ether, quivering 'twixt star and star,
  But yet, so still
  I know not whence they come, if mine they are.
  Yet that low note
  Increases in force as if it said, "I will":
  Kindled by God's fierce breath, it would the whole world fill.
  Till steadily outwards thrown,
  By trumpets blazoned, from the sky downblown,
  It grows a vast march, massive, monotonous, known
  Of old gold trumpeteers
  Through infinite years:
  Bursting the white, thronged vaults of the cool sky.
  Till hurtling down there falls one mad black hammer-blow:
  Then the chained echoes in their maniac woe
  Are loosed against the silence, to shriek uncannily.

  The strings shiver faintly, poet:
  Strike the strings,
  Speed the song:
  Tremulous upward rush of wheeling, whirling wings.


  EPILOGUE

  The barking of little dogs in the night is more remembered than
       the shining of the stars:
  Only those who watch for long may see the moon rise:
  And they are mad ever after and go with blind eyes
  Nosing hungrily in the gutter for the scraps that men throw to the dogs;
  Few heed their babblings.



  SAND AND SPRAY

  A SEA-SYMPHONY




THE GALE



  Pale green-white, in a gallop across the sky,
  The clouds retreating from a perilous affray
  Carry the moon with them, a heavy sack of gold;
  Sharp arrows, stars between them shoot and play.

  The wind, as it strikes the sand,
  Clutches with rigid hands
  And tears from them
  Thin ribbons of pallid sleet,
  Long stinging hissing drift,
  Which it trails up inland.

  I lean against the bitter wind:
  My body plunges like a ship.
  Out there I see grey breakers rise,
  Their ravelled beards are white,
  And foam is in their eyes.
  My heart is blown from me to-night
  To be transfixed by all the stars.

  Steadily the wind
  Rages up the shore:
  In the trees it roars and battles,
  With rattling drums
  And heavy spears,
  Towards the housefronts on it comes.

  The village, a loose mass outflung,
  Breaks its path.
  Between the walls
  It bounces, tosses in its wrath.
  It is broken, it is lost.

  With green-grey eyes,
  With whirling arms,
  With clashing feet,
  With bellowing lungs,
  Pale green-white in a gallop across the sky,
  The wind comes.

  The great gale of the winter flings himself flat upon earth.

  He hurriedly scribbles on the sand
  His transient tragic destiny.



VARIATIONS


SAILBOATS

  Light as thin-winged swallows pirouetting and gyrating,
  The sails dance in the estuary:
  Now heeling to the gust, now cantering,
  Bobbing as shuttles back and forth from each other.
  I They scorn the black steamers that steadily near them
  I On a course direct, with white spume of smoke from their bows,
  With snapping crash of breakers they fling themselves forward:
  Black on the wing-tips, white on the underside.
  These are the birds of the land breeze,
  Nesting on green waves in the gold sunlight:
  These are the sailships
  Heeling and tossing about in the estuary.



THE TIDE

  The tide makes music
  At the foot of the beach;
  The waves sing together
  Rumble of breakers.
  Ships there are swaying,
  Into the distance,
  Thrum of the cordage,
  Slap of the sails.

  The tide makes music
  At the foot of the beach;
  Low notes of an organ
 'Gainst the dull clang of bells.
  The tide's tense purple
  On the untrodden sand:
  Its throat is blue,
  Its hands are gold.

  The tide makes music:
  The tide all day
  Catches light from the clouds
  That float over the sky.

  Ocean, old serpent,
  Coils up and uncoils;
  With sinuous motion,
  With rustle of scales.


THE SANDS


  Shallow pools of water
  Are drinking up the sky;
  Chasms of cool blue-white
  In the brown of the sands.
  The clouds are in them,
  The houses on the shore,
  The winds rumple the even
  Glimmer of the reflection.

  I dash across those shallow pools:
  Starring their gauzy surface:
  A plopping rush of bubbles:
  I turn and watch my boot-tracks
  Oozing upwards slowly in the dark wind-wrinkled sand.


THE GULLS


  White stars scattering,
  Pale rain of spray-drops,
  Delicate flash of smoke wind-drifted low and high,
  Silver upon dark purple,
  The gulls quiver
  In a noiseless flight, far out across the sky.


STEAMERS

  Like black plunging dolphins with red bellies,
  The steamers in herds
  Swim through the choppy breakers
  On this day of winds and clouds.
  Wallowing and plunging,
  They seek their path,
  The smoke of their snorting
  Hangs in the sky.

  Like black plunging dolphins with red bellies,
  The steamers pass,
  Flapping their propellers
  Salt with the spray.
  Their iron sides glisten,
  Their stays thrash:
  Their funnels quiver
  With the heat from beneath.

  Like black plunging dolphins with red bellies,
  The steamers together
  Dive and roll through the tumult
  Of green hissing water.

  These are the avid of spoil,
  Gleaners of the seas,
  They loom on their adventure
  Up purple and chrome horizons.


NIGHT OF STARS



  The sky immense, bejewelled with rain of stars,
  Hangs over us:
  The stars like a sudden explosion powder the zenith
  With green and gold;
  North-east, south-west the Milky Way's pale streamers
  Flash past in flame;
  The sky is a swirling cataract
  Of fire, on high.

  Over us the sky up to the zenith
  Palpitates with tense glitter:
  About our keel the foam bubbles and curdles
  In phosphorescent joy.
  Flame boils up to meet down-rushing flame
  In the blue stillness.
  Aloft a single orange meteor
  Crashes down the sky.



VARIATIONS


THE GROUNDSWELL.



  With heavy doleful clamour, hour on hour, and day on day,
  The muddy groundswell lifts and breaks and falls and slides away.

  The cold and naked wind runs shivering over the sands,
  Salt are its eyes, open its mouth, its brow wet, blue its hands.

  It finds naught but a starving gull whose wings trail at its side,
  And the dull battered wreckage, grey jetsam of the tide.

  The lifeless chilly slaty sky with no blue hope is lit,
  A rusty waddling steamer plants a smudge of smoke on it.

  Stupidly stand the factory chimneys staring over all,
  The grey grows ever denser, and soon the night will fall:

  The wind runs sobbing over the beach and touches with its hands
  Straw, chaff, old bottles, broken crates, the litter of the sands.

  Sometimes the bloated carcase of a dog or fish is found,
  Sometimes the rumpled feathers of a sea-gull shot or drowned.

  Last year it was an unknown man who came up from the sea,
  There is his grave hard by the dunes under a stunted tree.

  With heavy doleful clamour, hour on hour, and day on day,
  The muddy groundswell lifts and breaks and falls and slides away.


SNOW AT SEA

  Silently fell
  The snow on the waters
  In the grey dusk
  Of the winter evening:
  Swirling and falling,
  Sucked into the oily
  Blue-black surface
  Of the sea.

  We pounded on slowly;
  From our bows sheeted
  A shuddering mass of heavy foam:
  Night closed about us,
  But ere we were darkened,
  We saw close in
  A great gaunt schooner
  Beating to southward.

  Silently fell
  The snow on the waters,
  As we pounded north
  In the winter evening.


THE NIGHT WIND
  Wind of the night, wind of the long cool shadows,
  Wind from the garden gate stealing up the avenue,
  Wind caressing my cool pale cheek completely,
  All my happiness goes out to you.

  Wind flapping aimlessly at my yellow window curtain,
  Wind suddenly insisting on your way down to the sea,
  Buoyant wind, sobbing wind, wind shuddering and plaintive,
  Why come you from beyond through the night's blue mystery?

  Wind of my dream, wind of the delicate beauty,
  Wind strumming idly at the harp-strings of my heart:
  Wind of the autumn -- O melancholy beauty,
  Touch me once -- one instant -- you and I shall never part!

  Wind of the night, wind that has fallen silent,
  Wind from the dark beyond crying suddenly, eerily,
  What terrible news have you shrieked out there in the stillness?
  The night is cool and quiet and the wind has crept to sea.


THE WRECK



  Its huge red prow
  Uplifted in a tragic attitude,
  It waits out there; the seas around
  Bubble and hiss with moaning sound:
  In sight of port at the gates of the sea,
  It waits upreared expectantly.

  It has known the joy of battle,
  It has known the shock of wreck:
  The spray coated its planking,
  The sands swallow its deck:
  Monument of the sea,
  That knows and that forgets eternally.

  It heaves its scarred brow towards the city:
  The city pays it little heed:
  Indifferent, brutal, without pity,
  Stern cargo-steamers trudge and speed;
  The sun glares on it and the gulls wheel and flash,
  The rain beats on its deck, the winds pass silently;
  It is out there alone with the immense sea:
  Alone with its forgotten tragedy.


TIDE OF STORMS


  Crooked, crawling tide with long wet fingers
  Clutching at the gritty beach in the roar and spurt of spray,
  Tide of gales, drunken tide, lava-burst of breakers,
  Black ships plunge upon you from sea to sea away.

  Shattering tide, tide of winds, tide of the long still winter,
  What matter though ships fail, men sink, there vanish glory?
  War-clouds shall hurl their stinging sleet upon our last adventure,
  Night-winds shall brokenly whisper our bitter, tragic story.




THE CALM


  In the morning I saw three great ships
  Almost motionless
  Becalmed on an infinite horizon.

  The clatter of waves up the beach,
  The grating rush of wet pebbles,
  The loud monotonous song of the surf,
  All these have soothed me
  And have given
  My soul to rest.

  At noon I shall see waves flashing,
  White power of spray.

  The steamers, stately,
  Kick up white puffs of spray behind them.
  The boiling wake
  Merges in the blue-black mirror of the sea.

  One eye of the sun sees all:
  The world, the wave, my heart.
  I am content.

  In the afternoon I shall dream a dream
  Of islands beyond the horizon.

  White clouds drift over the sky,
  Frigates on a long voyage.

  In the evening a mute blue stillness
  Clutches at my heart.
  Stars sparkle upon the tips of my fingers.

  Mystical hush,
  Fire in the darkness;
  The breaking of dreams.

  But in the morning I shall see three great
  Almost motionless
  Becalmed on an infinite horizon.

Amores

TEASE

I WILL give you all my keys,
  You shall be my chatelaine,
You shall enter as you please,
  As you please shall go again.

When I hear you jingling through
  All the chambers of my soul,
How I sit and laugh at you
  In your vain housekeeping role.

Jealous of the smallest cover,
  Angry at the simplest door;
Well, you anxious, inquisitive lover,
  Are you pleased with what's in store?

You have fingered all my treasures,
  Have you not, most curiously,
Handled all my tools and measures
  And masculine machinery?

Over every single beauty
  You have had your little rapture;
You have slain, as was your duty,
  Every sin-mouse you could capture.

Still you are not satisfied,
  Still you tremble faint reproach;
Challenge me I keep aside
  Secrets that you may not broach.

Maybe yes, and maybe no,
  Maybe there _are_ secret places,
Altars barbarous below,
  Elsewhere halls of high disgraces.

Maybe yes, and maybe no,
  You may have it as you please,
Since I choose to keep you so,
  Suppliant on your curious knees.


THE WILD COMMON

THE quick sparks on the gorse bushes are leaping,
Little jets of sunlight-texture imitating flame;
Above them, exultant, the pee-wits are sweeping:
They are lords of the desolate wastes of sadness
    their screamings proclaim.

Rabbits, handfuls of brown earth, lie
Low-rounded on the mournful grass they have bitten
    down to the quick.
Are they asleep? -- Are they alive? -- Now see,
    when I
Move my arms the hill bursts and heaves under their
    spurting kick.

The common flaunts bravely; but below, from the
    rushes
Crowds of glittering king-cups surge to challenge the
    blossoming bushes;
There the lazy streamlet pushes
Its curious course mildly; here it wakes again, leaps,
    laughs, and gushes.

Into a deep pond, an old sheep-dip,
Dark, overgrown with willows, cool, with the brook
    ebbing through so slow,
Naked on the steep, soft lip
Of the bank I stand watching my own white shadow
    quivering to and fro.

What if the gorse flowers shrivelled and kissing were
    lost?
Without the pulsing waters, where were the marigolds
    and the songs of the brook?
If my veins and my breasts with love embossed
Withered, my insolent soul would be gone like flowers
    that the hot wind took.

So my soul like a passionate woman turns,
Filled with remorseful terror to the man she scorned,
    and her love
For myself in my own eyes' laughter burns,
Runs ecstatic over the pliant folds rippling down to
    my belly from the breast-lights above.

Over my sunlit skin the warm, clinging air,
Rich with the songs of seven larks singing at once,
    goes kissing me glad.
And the soul of the wind and my blood compare
Their wandering happiness, and the wind, wasted in
    liberty, drifts on and is sad.

Oh but the water loves me and folds me,
Plays with me, sways me, lifts me and sinks me as
    though it were living blood,
Blood of a heaving woman who holds me,
Owning my supple body a rare glad thing, supremely
    good.


STUDY

SOMEWHERE the long mellow note of the blackbird
Quickens the unclasping hands of hazel,
Somewhere the wind-flowers fling their heads back,
Stirred by an impetuous wind. Some ways'll
All be sweet with white and blue violet.
    (_Hush now, hush. Where am I? -- Biuret -- _)

On the green wood's edge a shy girl hovers
From out of the hazel-screen on to the grass,
Where wheeling and screaming the petulant plovers
Wave frighted. Who comes? A labourer, alas!
Oh the sunset swims in her eyes' swift pool.
    (_Work, work, you fool -- !_)

Somewhere the lamp hanging low from the ceiling
Lights the soft hair of a girl as she reads,
And the red firelight steadily wheeling
Weaves the hard hands of my friend in sleep.
And the white dog snuffs the warmth, appealing
For the man to heed lest the girl shall weep.

(_Tears and dreams for them; for me
Bitter science -- the exams. are near.
I wish I bore it more patiently.
I wish you did not wait, my dear,
For me to come: since work I must:
Though it's all the same when we are dead. -- 
I wish I was only a bust,
      All head._)


DISCORD IN CHILDHOOD

OUTSIDE the house an ash-tree hung its terrible
    whips,
And at night when the wind arose, the lash of the tree
Shrieked and slashed the wind, as a ship's
Weird rigging in a storm shrieks hideously.

Within the house two voices arose in anger, a slender
    lash
Whistling delirious rage, and the dreadful sound
Of a thick lash booming and bruising, until it
    drowned
The other voice in a silence of blood, 'neath the noise
    of the ash.


VIRGIN YOUTH

Now and again
All my body springs alive,
And the life that is polarised in my eyes,
That quivers between my eyes and mouth,
Flies like a wild thing across my body,
Leaving my eyes half-empty, and clamorous,
Filling my still breasts with a flush and a flame,
Gathering the soft ripples below my breasts
Into urgent, passionate waves,
And my soft, slumbering belly
Quivering awake with one impulse of desire,
Gathers itself fiercely together;
And my docile, fluent arms
Knotting themselves with wild strength
To clasp what they have never clasped.
Then I tremble, and go trembling
Under the wild, strange tyranny of my body,
Till it has spent itself,
And the relentless nodality of my eyes reasserts itself,
Till the bursten flood of life ebbs back to my eyes,
Back from my beautiful, lonely body
Tired and unsatisfied.


MONOLOGUE OF A MOTHER

THIS is the last of all, this is the last!
I must hold my hands, and turn my face to the fire,
I must watch my dead days fusing together in dross,
Shape after shape, and scene after scene from my past
Fusing to one dead mass in the sinking fire
Where the ash on the dying coals grows swiftly, like
    heavy moss.

Strange he is, my son, whom I have awaited like a
    lover,
Strange to me like a captive in a foreign country,
    haunting
The confines and gazing out on the land where the
    wind is free;
White and gaunt, with wistful eyes that hover
Always on the distance, as if his soul were chaunting
The monotonous weird of departure away from me.

Like a strange white bird blown out of the frozen
    seas,
Like a bird from the far north blown with a broken
    wing
Into our sooty garden, he drags and beats
From place to place perpetually, seeking release
From me, from the hand of my love which creeps up,
    needing
His happiness, whilst he in displeasure retreats.

I must look away from him, for my faded eyes
Like a cringing dog at his heels offend him now,
Like a toothless hound pursuing him with my will,
Till he chafes at my crouching persistence, and a
    sharp spark flies
In my soul from under the sudden frown of his brow,
As he blenches and turns away, and my heart stands
    still.

This is the last, it will not be any more.
All my life I have borne the burden of myself,
All the long years of sitting in my husband's house,
Never have I said to myself as he closed the door:
Now I am caught! -- You are hopelessly lost, O
    Self,
You are frightened with joy, my heart, like a
    frightened mouse.

Three times have I offered myself, three times rejected.
It will not be any more. No more, my son, my son!
Never to know the glad freedom of obedience, since
    long ago
The angel of childhood kissed me and went. I expected
Another would take me, -- and now, my son, O my son,
I must sit awhile and wait, and never know
The loss of myself, till death comes, who cannot fail.

Death, in whose service is nothing of gladness, takes
    me;
For the lips and the eyes of God are behind a veil.
And the thought of the lipless voice of the Father
    shakes me
With fear, and fills my eyes with the tears of desire,
And my heart rebels with anguish as night draws
    nigher,


IN A BOAT

SEE the stars, love,
In the water much clearer and brighter
Than those above us, and whiter,
Like nenuphars.

Star-shadows shine, love,
How many stars in your bowl?
How many shadows in your soul,
Only mine, love, mine?

When I move the oars, love,
See how the stars are tossed,
Distorted, the brightest lost.
 -- So that bright one of yours, love.

The poor waters spill
The stars, waters broken, forsaken.
 -- The heavens are not shaken, you say, love,
Its stars stand still.

There, did you see
That spark fly up at us; even
Stars are not safe in heaven.
 -- What of yours, then, love, yours?

What then, love, if soon
Your light be tossed over a wave?
Will you count the darkness a grave,
And swoon, love, swoon?


WEEK-NIGHT SERVICE

THE five old bells
Are hurrying and eagerly calling,
Imploring, protesting
They know, but clamorously falling
Into gabbling incoherence, never resting,
Like spattering showers from a bursten sky-rocket
    dropping
In splashes of sound, endlessly, never stopping.

The silver moon
That somebody has spun so high
To settle the question, yes or no, has caught
In the net of the night's balloon,
And sits with a smooth bland smile up there in
    the sky
Smiling at naught,
Unless the winking star that keeps her company
Makes little jests at the bells' insanity,
As if _he_ knew aught!

The patient Night
Sits indifferent, hugged in her rags,
She neither knows nor cares
Why the old church sobs and brags;
The light distresses her eyes, and tears
Her old blue cloak, as she crouches and covers her
    face,
Smiling, perhaps, if we knew it, at the bells' loud
    clattering disgrace.

The wise old trees
Drop their leaves with a faint, sharp hiss of contempt,
While a car at the end of the street goes by with a
    laugh;
As by degrees
The poor bells cease, and the Night is exempt,
And the stars can chaff
The ironic moon at their ease, while the dim old
    church
Is peopled with shadows and sounds and ghosts that
    lurch
In its cenotaph.


IRONY

ALWAYS, sweetheart,
Carry into your room the blossoming boughs of
    cherry,
Almond and apple and pear diffuse with light, that
    very
Soon strews itself on the floor; and keep the radiance
    of spring
Fresh quivering; keep the sunny-swift March-days
    waiting
In a little throng at your door, and admit the one
    who is plaiting
Her hair for womanhood, and play awhile with her,
    then bid her depart.

    A come and go of March-day loves
    Through the flower-vine, trailing screen;
       A fluttering in of doves.
    Then a launch abroad of shrinking doves
    Over the waste where no hope is seen
    Of open hands:
               Dance in and out
    Small-bosomed girls of the spring of love,
    With a bubble of laughter, and shrilly shout
    Of mirth; then the dripping of tears on your
        glove.


DREAMS OLD AND NASCENT

OLD

I HAVE opened the window to warm my hands on the
    sill
Where the sunlight soaks in the stone: the afternoon
Is full of dreams, my love, the boys are all still
In a wistful dream of Lorna Doone.

The clink of the shunting engines is sharp and fine,
Like savage music striking far off, and there
On the great, uplifted blue palace, lights stir and
   shine
Where the glass is domed in the blue, soft air.

There lies the world, my darling, full of wonder and
    wistfulness and strange
Recognition and greetings of half-acquaint things, as
    I greet the cloud
Of blue palace aloft there, among misty indefinite
    dreams that range
At the back of my life's horizon, where the dreamings
    of past lives crowd.

Over the nearness of Norwood Hill, through the
    mellow veil
Of the afternoon glows to me the old romance of
    David and Dora,
With the old, sweet, soothing tears, and laughter
    that shakes the sail
Of the ship of the soul over seas where dreamed
    dreams lure the unoceaned explorer.

All the bygone, hushed years
Streaming back where the mist distils
Into forgetfulness: soft-sailing waters where fears
No longer shake, where the silk sail fills
With an unfelt breeze that ebbs over the seas, where
    the storm
Of living has passed, on and on
Through the coloured iridescence that swims in the
    warm
Wake of the tumult now spent and gone,
Drifts my boat, wistfully lapsing after
The mists of vanishing tears and the echo of laughter.


DREAMS OLD AND NASCENT

NASCENT

MY world is a painted fresco, where coloured shapes
Of old, ineffectual lives linger blurred and warm;
An endless tapestry the past has woven drapes
The halls of my life, compelling my soul to conform.

The surface of dreams is broken,
The picture of the past is shaken and scattered.
Fluent, active figures of men pass along the railway,
    and I am woken
From the dreams that the distance flattered.

Along the railway, active figures of men.
They have a secret that stirs in their limbs as they
    move
Out of the distance, nearer, commanding my dreamy
    world.

Here in the subtle, rounded flesh
Beats the active ecstasy.
In the sudden lifting my eyes, it is clearer,
The fascination of the quick, restless Creator moving
    through the mesh
Of men, vibrating in ecstasy through the rounded
    flesh.

Oh my boys, bending over your books,
In you is trembling and fusing
The creation of a new-patterned dream, dream of a
    generation:
And I watch to see the Creator, the power that
    patterns the dream.

The old dreams are beautiful, beloved, soft-toned,
    and sure,
But the dream-stuff is molten and moving mysteriously,
Alluring my eyes; for I, am I not also dream-stuff,
Am I not quickening, diffusing myself in the pattern,
    shaping and shapen?

Here in my class is the answer for the great yearning:
Eyes where I can watch the swim of old dreams
    reflected on the molten metal of dreams,
Watch the stir which is rhythmic and moves them
    all as a heart-beat moves the blood,
Here in the swelling flesh the great activity working,
Visible there in the change of eyes and the mobile
    features.

Oh the great mystery and fascination of the unseen
    Shaper,
The power of the melting, fusing Force -- heat,
    light, all in one,
Everything great and mysterious in one, swelling and
    shaping the dream in the flesh,
As it swells and shapes a bud into blossom.

Oh the terrible ecstasy of the consciousness that I
    am life!
Oh the miracle of the whole, the widespread, labouring
    concentration
Swelling mankind like one bud to bring forth the
    fruit of a dream,
Oh the terror of lifting the innermost I out of the
    sweep of the impulse of life,
And watching the great Thing labouring through the
    whole round flesh of the world;
And striving to catch a glimpse of the shape of the
    coming dream,
As it quickens within the labouring, white-hot metal,
Catch the scent and the colour of the coming dream,
Then to fall back exhausted into the unconscious,
    molten life!


A WINTER'S TALE

YESTERDAY the fields were only grey with scattered
   snow,
And now the longest grass-leaves hardly emerge;
Yet her deep footsteps mark the snow, and go
On towards the pines at the hills' white verge.

I cannot see her, since the mist's white scarf
Obscures the dark wood and the dull orange sky;
But she's waiting, I know, impatient and cold, half
Sobs struggling into her frosty sigh.

Why does she come so promptly, when she must
   know
That she's only the nearer to the inevitable farewell;
The hill is steep, on the snow my steps are slow -- 
Why does she come, when she knows what I have to
   tell?


EPILOGUE

PATIENCE, little Heart.
One day a heavy, June-hot woman
Will enter and shut the door to stay.

And when your stifling heart would summon
Cool, lonely night, her roused breasts will keep the
     night at bay,
Sitting in your room like two tiger-lilies
Flaming on after sunset,
Destroying the cool, lonely night with the glow of
     their hot twilight;
There in the morning, still, while the fierce strange
     scent comes yet
Stronger, hot and red; till you thirst for the
     daffodillies
With an anguished, husky thirst that you cannot
     assuage,
When the daffodillies are dead, and a woman of the
     dog-days holds you in gage.
Patience, little Heart.


A BABY RUNNING BAREFOOT

WHEN the bare feet of the baby beat across the grass
The little white feet nod like white flowers in the
    wind,
They poise and run like ripples lapping across the
    water;
And the sight of their white play among the grass
Is like a little robin's song, winsome,
Or as two white butterflies settle in the cup of one
    flower
For a moment, then away with a flutter of wings.

I long for the baby to wander hither to me
Like a wind-shadow wandering over the water,
So that she can stand on my knee
With her little bare feet in my hands,
Cool like syringa buds,
Firm and silken like pink young peony flowers.



DISCIPLINE

IT is stormy, and raindrops cling like silver bees to
     the pane,
The thin sycamores in the playground are swinging
     with flattened leaves;
The heads of the boys move dimly through a yellow
     gloom that stains
The class; over them all the dark net of my discipline
     weaves.

It is no good, dear, gentleness and forbearance, I
     endured too long.
I have pushed my hands in the dark soil, under the
     flower of my soul
And the gentle leaves, and have felt where the roots
     are strong
Fixed in the darkness, grappling for the deep soil's
     little control.

And there is the dark, my darling, where the roots
     are entangled and fight
Each one for its hold on the oblivious darkness, I
     know that there
In the night where we first have being, before we rise
     on the light,
We are not brothers, my darling, we fight and we
     do not spare.

And in the original dark the roots cannot keep,
     cannot know
Any communion whatever, but they bind themselves
     on to the dark,
And drawing the darkness together, crush from it a
     twilight, a slow
Burning that breaks at last into leaves and a flower's
     bright spark.

I came to the boys with love, my dear, but they
     turned on me;
I came with gentleness, with my heart 'twixt my
     hands like a bowl,
Like a loving-cup, like a grail, but they spilt it
     triumphantly
And tried to break the vessel, and to violate my
     soul.

But what have I to do with the boys, deep down in
     my soul, my love?
I throw from out of the darkness my self like a flower
     into sight,
Like a flower from out of the night-time, I lift my
     face, and those
Who will may warm their hands at me, comfort this
     night.

But whosoever would pluck apart my flowering shall
     burn their hands,
So flowers are tender folk, and roots can only hide,
Yet my flowerings of love are a fire, and the scarlet
     brands
Of my love are roses to look at, but flames to chide.

But comfort me, my love, now the fires are low,
Now I am broken to earth like a winter destroyed,
     and all
Myself but a knowledge of roots, of roots in the dark
     that throw
A net on the undersoil, which lies passive beneath
     their thrall.

But comfort me, for henceforth my love is yours
     alone,
To you alone will I offer the bowl, to you will I give
My essence only, but love me, and I will atone
To you for my general loving, atone as long as I live.


SCENT OF IRISES

A FAINT, sickening scent of irises
Persists all morning. Here in a jar on the table
A fine proud spike of purple irises
Rising above the class-room litter, makes me unable
To see the class's lifted and bended faces
Save in a broken pattern, amid purple and gold and
    sable.

I can smell the gorgeous bog-end, in its breathless
Dazzle of may-blobs, when the marigold glare overcast
     you
With fire on your cheeks and your brow and your
    chin as you dipped
Your face in the marigold bunch, to touch and contrast
    you,
Your own dark mouth with the bridal faint lady-smocks,
Dissolved on the golden sorcery you should not
    outlast.

You amid the bog-end's yellow incantation,
You sitting in the cowslips of the meadow above,
Me, your shadow on the bog-flame, flowery may-blobs,
Me full length in the cowslips, muttering you love;
You, your soul like a lady-smock, lost, evanescent,
You with your face all rich, like the sheen of a
    dove.

You are always asking, do I remember, remember
The butter-cup bog-end where the flowers rose up
And kindled you over deep with a cast of gold?
You ask again, do the healing days close up
The open darkness which then drew us in,
The dark which then drank up our brimming cup.

You upon the dry, dead beech-leaves, in the fire of
    night
Burnt like a sacrifice; you invisible;
Only the fire of darkness, and the scent of you!
 -- And yes, thank God, it still is possible
The healing days shall close the darkness up
Wherein we fainted like a smoke or dew.

Like vapour, dew, or poison. Now, thank God,
The fire of night is gone, and your face is ash
Indistinguishable on the grey, chill day;
The night has burnt us out, at last the good
Dark fire burns on untroubled, without clash
Of you upon the dead leaves saying me Yea.


THE PROPHET

AH, my darling, when over the purple horizon shall
    loom
The shrouded mother of a new idea, men hide their
    faces,
Cry out and fend her off, as she seeks her procreant
    groom,
Wounding themselves against her, denying her
    fecund embraces.


LAST WORDS TO MIRIAM

YOURS is the shame and sorrow
  But the disgrace is mine;
Your love was dark and thorough,
Mine was the love of the sun for a flower
  He creates with his shine.

I was diligent to explore you,
  Blossom you stalk by stalk,
Till my fire of creation bore you
Shrivelling down in the final dour
  Anguish -- then I suffered a balk.

I knew your pain, and it broke
  My fine, craftsman's nerve;
Your body quailed at my stroke,
And my courage failed to give you the last
  Fine torture you did deserve.

You are shapely, you are adorned,
  But opaque and dull in the flesh,
Who, had I but pierced with the thorned
Fire-threshing anguish, were fused and cast
  In a lovely illumined mesh.

Like a painted window: the best
  Suffering burnt through your flesh,
Undrossed it and left it blest
With a quivering sweet wisdom of grace: but
     now
  Who shall take you afresh?

Now who will burn you free
  From your body's terrors and dross,
Since the fire has failed in me?
What man will stoop in your flesh to plough
  The shrieking cross?

A mute, nearly beautiful thing
  Is your face, that fills me with shame
As I see it hardening,
Warping the perfect image of God,
  And darkening my eternal fame.


MYSTERY

Now I am all
One bowl of kisses,
Such as the tall
Slim votaresses
Of Egypt filled
For a God's excesses.

I lift to you
My bowl of kisses,
And through the temple's
Blue recesses
Cry out to you
In wild caresses.

And to my lips'
Bright crimson rim
The passion slips,
And down my slim
White body drips
The shining hymn.

And still before
The altar I
Exult the bowl
Brimful, and cry
To you to stoop
And drink, Most High.

Oh drink me up
That I may be
Within your cup
Like a mystery,
Like wine that is still
In ecstasy.

Glimmering still
In ecstasy,
Commingled wines
Of you and me
In one fulfil
The mystery.


PATIENCE

A WIND comes from the north
Blowing little flocks of birds
Like spray across the town,
And a train, roaring forth,
Rushes stampeding down
With cries and flying curds
Of steam, out of the darkening north.

Whither I turn and set
Like a needle steadfastly,
Waiting ever to get
The news that she is free;
But ever fixed, as yet,
To the lode of her agony.


BALLAD OF ANOTHER OPHELIA

OH the green glimmer of apples in the orchard,
Lamps in a wash of rain!
Oh the wet walk of my brown hen through the stack-yard,
Oh tears on the window pane!

Nothing now will ripen the bright green apples,
Full of disappointment and of rain,
Brackish they will taste, of tears, when the yellow
    dapples
Of autumn tell the withered tale again.

All round the yard it is cluck, my brown hen,
Cluck, and the rain-wet wings,
Cluck, my marigold bird, and again
Cluck for your yellow darlings.

For the grey rat found the gold thirteen
Huddled away in the dark,
Flutter for a moment, oh the beast is quick and
    keen,
Extinct one yellow-fluffy spark.

Once I had a lover bright like running water,
Once his face was laughing like the sky;
Open like the sky looking down in all its laughter
On the buttercups, and the buttercups was I.

What, then, is there hidden in the skirts of all the
    blossom?
What is peeping from your wings, oh mother
    hen?
'Tis the sun who asks the question, in a lovely haste
    for wisdom;
What a lovely haste for wisdom is in men!

Yea, but it is cruel when undressed is all the blossom,
And her shift is lying white upon the floor,
That a grey one, like a shadow, like a rat, a thief, a
    rain-storm,
Creeps upon her then and gathers in his store.

Oh the grey garner that is full of half-grown apples,
Oh the golden sparkles laid extinct!
And oh, behind the cloud-sheaves, like yellow autumn
    dapples,
Did you see the wicked sun that winked!


RESTLESSNESS

AT the open door of the room I stand and look at
    the night,
Hold my hand to catch the raindrops, that slant into
    sight,
Arriving grey from the darkness above suddenly into
    the light of the room.
I will escape from the hollow room, the box of light,
And be out in the bewildering darkness, which is
    always fecund, which might
Mate my hungry soul with a germ of its womb.

I will go out to the night, as a man goes down to the
    shore
To draw his net through the surfs thin line, at the
    dawn before
The sun warms the sea, little, lonely and sad, sifting
    the sobbing tide.
I will sift the surf that edges the night, with my net,
    the four
Strands of my eyes and my lips and my hands and my
    feet, sifting the store
Of flotsam until my soul is tired or satisfied.

I will catch in my eyes' quick net
The faces of all the women as they go past,
Bend over them with my soul, to cherish the wet
Cheeks and wet hair a moment, saying: Is it
    you?
Looking earnestly under the dark umbrellas, held
    fast
Against the wind; and if, where the lamplight
    blew
Its rainy swill about us, she answered me
With a laugh and a merry wildness that it was she
Who was seeking me, and had found me at last to
    free
Me now from the stunting bonds of my chastity,
How glad I should be!

Moving along in the mysterious ebb of the night
Pass the men whose eyes are shut like anemones in a
    dark pool;
Why don't they open with vision and speak to me,
    what have they in sight?
Why do I wander aimless among them, desirous
    fool?

I can always linger over the huddled books on the
    stalls,
Always gladden my amorous fingers with the touch
    of their leaves,
Always kneel in courtship to the shelves in the
    doorways, where falls
The shadow, always offer myself to one mistress,
    who always receives.

But oh, it is not enough, it is all no good.
There is something I want to feel in my running
    blood,
Something I want to touch; I must hold my face to
    the rain,
I must hold my face to the wind, and let it explain
Me its life as it hurries in secret.
I will trail my hands again through the drenched,
    cold leaves
Till my hands are full of the chillness and touch of
    leaves,
Till at length they induce me to sleep, and to forget.


A BABY ASLEEP AFTER PAIN

  As a drenched, drowned bee
Hangs numb and heavy from a bending flower,
  So clings to me
My baby, her brown hair brushed with wet tears
  And laid against her cheek;
Her soft white legs hanging heavily over my arm
Swinging heavily to my movement as I walk.
  My sleeping baby hangs upon my life,
Like a burden she hangs on me.
  She has always seemed so light,
But now she is wet with tears and numb with pain
Even her floating hair sinks heavily,
  Reaching downwards;
As the wings of a drenched, drowned bee
  Are a heaviness, and a weariness.


ANXIETY

THE hoar-frost crumbles in the sun,
  The crisping steam of a train
Melts in the air, while two black birds
  Sweep past the window again.

Along the vacant road, a red
  Bicycle approaches; I wait
In a thaw of anxiety, for the boy
  To leap down at our gate.

He has passed us by; but is it
  Relief that starts in my breast?
Or a deeper bruise of knowing that still
  She has no rest.


THE PUNISHER

I HAVE fetched the tears up out of the little wells,
Scooped them up with small, iron words,
     Dripping over the runnels.

The harsh, cold wind of my words drove on, and still
I watched the tears on the guilty cheek of the boys
     Glitter and spill.

Cringing Pity, and Love, white-handed, came
Hovering about the Judgment which stood in my
          eyes,
     Whirling a flame.

     .     .     .     .     .     .     .

The tears are dry, and the cheeks' young fruits are
          fresh
With laughter, and clear the exonerated eyes, since
          pain
     Beat through the flesh.

The Angel of Judgment has departed again to the
          Nearness.
Desolate I am as a church whose lights are put out.
     And night enters in drearness.

The fire rose up in the bush and blazed apace,
The thorn-leaves crackled and twisted and sweated in
          anguish;
     Then God left the place.

Like a flower that the frost has hugged and let go,
          my head
Is heavy, and my heart beats slowly, laboriously,
     My strength is shed.


THE END

IF I could have put you in my heart,
If but I could have wrapped you in myself,
How glad I should have been!
And now the chart
Of memory unrolls again to me
The course of our journey here, before we had to
    part.

And oh, that you had never, never been
Some of your selves, my love, that some
Of your several faces I had never seen!
And still they come before me, and they go,
And I cry aloud in the moments that intervene.

And oh, my love, as I rock for you to-night,
And have not any longer any hope
To heal the suffering, or make requite
For all your life of asking and despair,
I own that some of me is dead to-night.


THE BRIDE

MY love looks like a girl to-night,
      But she is old.
The plaits that lie along her pillow
      Are not gold,
But threaded with filigree,
      And uncanny cold.

She looks like a young maiden, since her brow
      Is smooth and fair,
Her cheeks are very smooth, her eyes are closed,
      She sleeps a rare
Still winsome sleep, so still, and so composed.

Nay, but she sleeps like a bride, and dreams her
           dreams
      Of perfect things.
She lies at last, the darling, in the shape of her dream,
      And her dead mouth sings
By its shape, like the thrushes in clear evenings.


THE VIRGIN MOTHER

MY little love, my darling,
You were a doorway to me;
You let me out of the confines
Into this strange countrie,
Where people are crowded like thistles,
Yet are shapely and comely to see.

My little love, my dearest
Twice have you issued me,
Once from your womb, sweet mother,
Once from myself, to be
Free of all hearts, my darling,
Of each heart's home-life free.

And so, my love, my mother,
I shall always be true to you;
Twice I am born, my dearest,
To life, and to death, in you;
And this is the life hereafter
Wherein I am true.

I kiss you good-bye, my darling,
Our ways are different now;
You are a seed in the night-time,
I am a man, to plough
The difficult glebe of the future
For God to endow.

I kiss you good-bye, my dearest,
It is finished between us here.
Oh, if I were calm as you are,
Sweet and still on your bier!
God, if I had not to leave you
Alone, my dear!

Let the last word be uttered,
Oh grant the farewell is said!
Spare me the strength to leave you
Now you are dead.
I must go, but my soul lies helpless
Beside your bed.


AT THE WINDOW

THE pine-trees bend to listen to the autumn wind
    as it mutters
Something which sets the black poplars ashake with
    hysterical laughter;
While slowly the house of day is closing its eastern
    shutters.

Further down the valley the clustered tombstones
    recede,
Winding about their dimness the mist's grey
    cerements, after
The street lamps in the darkness have suddenly
    started to bleed.

The leaves fly over the window and utter a word as
    they pass
To the face that leans from the darkness, intent, with
    two dark-filled eyes
That watch for ever earnestly from behind the window
    glass.


DRUNK

Too far away, oh love, I know,
To save me from this haunted road,
Whose lofty roses break and blow
On a night-sky bent with a load

Of lights: each solitary rose,
Each arc-lamp golden does expose
Ghost beyond ghost of a blossom, shows
Night blenched with a thousand snows.

Of hawthorn and of lilac trees,
White lilac; shows discoloured night
Dripping with all the golden lees
Laburnum gives back to light

And shows the red of hawthorn set
On high to the purple heaven of night,
Like flags in blenched blood newly wet,
Blood shed in the noiseless fight.

Of life for love and love for life,
Of hunger for a little food,
Of kissing, lost for want of a wife
Long ago, long ago wooed.
   .      .      .      .      .      .
Too far away you are, my love,
To steady my brain in this phantom show
That passes the nightly road above
And returns again below.

The enormous cliff of horse-chestnut trees
  Has poised on each of its ledges
An erect small girl looking down at me;
White-night-gowned little chits I see,
  And they peep at me over the edges
Of the leaves as though they would leap, should
         I call
  Them down to my arms;
But, child, you're too small for me, too small
  Your little charms.

White little sheaves of night-gowned maids,
  Some other will thresh you out!
And I see leaning from the shades
A lilac like a lady there, who braids
  Her white mantilla about
Her face, and forward leans to catch the sight
    Of a man's face,
Gracefully sighing through the white
    Flowery mantilla of lace.

And another lilac in purple veiled
  Discreetly, all recklessly calls
In a low, shocking perfume, to know who has hailed
Her forth from the night: my strength has failed
  In her voice, my weak heart falls:
Oh, and see the laburnum shimmering
    Her draperies down,
As if she would slip the gold, and glimmering
    White, stand naked of gown.

     .      .      .      .      .      .

The pageant of flowery trees above
  The street pale-passionate goes,
And back again down the pavement, Love
  In a lesser pageant flows.

Two and two are the folk that walk,
  They pass in a half embrace
Of linked bodies, and they talk
  With dark face leaning to face.

Come then, my love, come as you will
  Along this haunted road,
Be whom you will, my darling, I shall
  Keep with you the troth I trowed.


SORROW

WHY does the thin grey strand
Floating up from the forgotten
Cigarette between my fingers,
Why does it trouble me?

Ah, you will understand;
When I carried my mother downstairs,
A few times only, at the beginning
Of her soft-foot malady,

I should find, for a reprimand
To my gaiety, a few long grey hairs
On the breast of my coat; and one by one
I let them float up the dark chimney.


DOLOR OF AUTUMN

THE acrid scents of autumn,
Reminiscent of slinking beasts, make me fear
Everything, tear-trembling stars of autumn
And the snore of the night in my ear.

For suddenly, flush-fallen,
All my life, in a rush
Of shedding away, has left me
Naked, exposed on the bush.

I, on the bush of the globe,
Like a newly-naked berry, shrink
Disclosed: but I also am prowling
As well in the scents that slink

Abroad: I in this naked berry
Of flesh that stands dismayed on the bush;
And I in the stealthy, brindled odours
Prowling about the lush

And acrid night of autumn;
My soul, along with the rout,
Rank and treacherous, prowling,
Disseminated out.

For the night, with a great breath intaken,
Has taken my spirit outside
Me, till I reel with disseminated consciousness,
Like a man who has died.

At the same time I stand exposed
Here on the bush of the globe,
A newly-naked berry of flesh
For the stars to probe.


THE INHERITANCE

SINCE you did depart
Out of my reach, my darling,
Into the hidden,
I see each shadow start
With recognition, and I
Am wonder-ridden.

I am dazed with the farewell,
But I scarcely feel your loss.
You left me a gift
Of tongues, so the shadows tell
Me things, and silences toss
Me their drift.

You sent me a cloven fire
Out of death, and it burns in the draught
Of the breathing hosts,
Kindles the darkening pyre
For the sorrowful, till strange brands waft
Like candid ghosts.

Form after form, in the streets
Waves like a ghost along,
Kindled to me;
The star above the house-top greets
Me every eve with a long
Song fierily.

All day long, the town
Glimmers with subtle ghosts
Going up and down
In a common, prison-like dress;
But their daunted looking flickers
To me, and I answer, Yes!

So I am not lonely nor sad
Although bereaved of you,
My little love.
I move among a kinsfolk clad
With words, but the dream shows through
As they move.


SILENCE

SINCE I lost you I am silence-haunted,
  Sounds wave their little wings
A moment, then in weariness settle
  On the flood that soundless swings.

Whether the people in the street
  Like pattering ripples go by,
Or whether the theatre sighs and sighs
  With a loud, hoarse sigh:

Or the wind shakes a ravel of light
  Over the dead-black river,
Or night's last echoing
  Makes the daybreak shiver:

I feel the silence waiting
  To take them all up again
In its vast completeness, enfolding
  The sound of men.


LISTENING

I LISTEN to the stillness of you,
   My dear, among it all;
I feel your silence touch my words as I talk,
   And take them in thrall.

My words fly off a forge
   The length of a spark;
I see the night-sky easily sip them
   Up in the dark.

The lark sings loud and glad,
   Yet I am not loth
That silence should take the song and the bird
   And lose them both.

A train goes roaring south,
   The steam-flag flying;
I see the stealthy shadow of silence
   Alongside going.

And off the forge of the world,
   Whirling in the draught of life,
Go sparks of myriad people, filling
   The night with strife.

Yet they never change the darkness
   Or blench it with noise;
Alone on the perfect silence
   The stars are buoys.


BROODING GRIEF

A YELLOW leaf from the darkness
Hops like a frog before me.
Why should I start and stand still?

I was watching the woman that bore me
Stretched in the brindled darkness
Of the sick-room, rigid with will
To die: and the quick leaf tore me
Back to this rainy swill
Of leaves and lamps and traffic mingled before me.


LOTUS HURT BY THE COLD

How many times, like lotus lilies risen
   Upon the surface of a river, there
   Have risen floating on my blood the rare
Soft glimmers of my hope escaped from prison.

So I am clothed all over with the light
   And sensitive beautiful blossoming of passion;
   Till naked for her in the finest fashion
The flowers of all my mud swim into sight.

And then I offer all myself unto
   This woman who likes to love me: but she turns
   A look of hate upon the flower that burns
To break and pour her out its precious dew.

And slowly all the blossom shuts in pain,
   And all the lotus buds of love sink over
   To die unopened: when my moon-faced lover,
Kind on the weight of suffering, smiles again.


MALADE

THE sick grapes on the chair by the bed lie prone;
    at the window
The tassel of the blind swings gently, tapping the
    pane,
As a little wind comes in.
The room is the hollow rind of a fruit, a gourd
Scooped out and dry, where a spider,
Folded in its legs as in a bed,
Lies on the dust, watching where is nothing to see
    but twilight and walls.

And if the day outside were mine! What is the day
But a grey cave, with great grey spider-cloths
    hanging
Low from the roof, and the wet dust falling softly
    from them
Over the wet dark rocks, the houses, and over
The spiders with white faces, that scuttle on the
    floor of the cave!
I am choking with creeping, grey confinedness.

But somewhere birds, beside a lake of light, spread
    wings
Larger than the largest fans, and rise in a stream
    upwards
And upwards on the sunlight that rains invisible,
So that the birds are like one wafted feather,
Small and ecstatic suspended over a vast spread
    country.


LIAISON

A BIG bud of moon hangs out of the twilight,
  Star-spiders spinning their thread
Hang high suspended, withouten respite
  Watching us overhead.

Come then under the trees, where the leaf-cloths
  Curtain us in so dark
That here we're safe from even the ermin-moth's
  Flitting remark.

Here in this swarthy, secret tent,
  Where black boughs flap the ground,
You shall draw the thorn from my discontent,
  Surgeon me sound.

This rare, rich night! For in here
  Under the yew-tree tent
The darkness is loveliest where I could sear
  You like frankincense into scent.

Here not even the stars can spy us,
  Not even the white moths write
With their little pale signs on the wall, to try us
  And set us affright.

Kiss but then the dust from off my lips,
  But draw the turgid pain
From my breast to your bosom, eclipse
  My soul again.

Waste me not, I beg you, waste
  Not the inner night:
Taste, oh taste and let me taste
  The core of delight.


TROTH WITH THE DEAD

THE moon is broken in twain, and half a moon
Before me lies on the still, pale floor of the sky;
The other half of the broken coin of troth
Is buried away in the dark, where the still dead lie.
They buried her half in the grave when they laid her
    away;
I had pushed it gently in among the thick of her hair
Where it gathered towards the plait, on that very
    last day;
And like a moon in secret it is shining there.

My half shines in the sky, for a general sign
Of the troth with the dead I pledged myself to keep;
Turning its broken edge to the dark, it shines indeed
Like the sign of a lover who turns to the dark of
    sleep.
Against my heart the inviolate sleep breaks still
In darkened waves whose breaking echoes o'er
The wondering world of my wakeful day, till I'm
    lost
In the midst of the places I knew so well before.


DISSOLUTE

MANY years have I still to burn, detained
Like a candle flame on this body; but I enshrine
A darkness within me, a presence which sleeps
    contained
In my flame of living, her soul enfolded in mine.

And through these years, while I burn on the fuel of
    life,
What matter the stuff I lick up in my living flame,
Seeing I keep in the fire-core, inviolate,
A night where she dreams my dreams for me, ever
    the same.


SUBMERGENCE

WHEN along the pavement,
Palpitating flames of life,
People flicker round me,
I forget my bereavement,
The gap in the great constellation,
The place where a star used to be.

Nay, though the pole-star
Is blown out like a candle,
And all the heavens are wandering in disarray,
Yet when pleiads of people are
Deployed around me, and I see
The street's long outstretched Milky Way,

When people flicker down the pavement,
I forget my bereavement.


THE ENKINDLED SPRING

THIS spring as it comes bursts up in bonfires green,
Wild puffing of emerald trees, and flame-filled bushes,
Thorn-blossom lifting in wreaths of smoke between
Where the wood fumes up and the watery, flickering
    rushes.

I am amazed at this spring, this conflagration
Of green fires lit on the soil of the earth, this blaze
Of growing, and sparks that puff in wild gyration,
Faces of people streaming across my gaze.

And I, what fountain of fire am I among
This leaping combustion of spring? My spirit is
    tossed
About like a shadow buffeted in the throng
Of flames, a shadow that's gone astray, and is lost.


REPROACH

HAD I but known yesterday,
Helen, you could discharge the ache
    Out of the cloud;
Had I known yesterday you could take
The turgid electric ache away,
    Drink it up with your proud
White body, as lovely white lightning
Is drunk from an agonised sky by the earth,
I might have hated you, Helen.

But since my limbs gushed full of fire,
Since from out of my blood and bone
    Poured a heavy flame
To you, earth of my atmosphere, stone
Of my steel, lovely white flint of desire,
    You have no name.
Earth of my swaying atmosphere,
Substance of my inconstant breath,
I cannot but cleave to you.

Since you have drunken up the drear
Painful electric storm, and death
    Is washed from the blue
Of my eyes, I see you beautiful.
You are strong and passive and beautiful,
I come like winds that uncertain hover;
    But you
Are the earth I hover over.


THE HANDS OF THE BETROTHED

HER tawny eyes are onyx of thoughtlessness,
Hardened they are like gems in ancient modesty;
Yea, and her mouth's prudent and crude caress
Means even less than her many words to me.

Though her kiss betrays me also this, this only
Consolation, that in her lips her blood at climax
    clips
Two wild, dumb paws in anguish on the lonely
Fruit of my heart, ere down, rebuked, it slips.

I know from her hardened lips that still her heart is
Hungry for me, yet if I put my hand in her breast
She puts me away, like a saleswoman whose mart is
Endangered by the pilferer on his quest.

But her hands are still the woman, the large, strong
    hands
Heavier than mine, yet like leverets caught in
    steel
When I hold them; my still soul understands
Their dumb confession of what her sort must feel.

For never her hands come nigh me but they lift
Like heavy birds from the morning stubble, to
    settle
Upon me like sleeping birds, like birds that shift
Uneasily in their sleep, disturbing my mettle.

How caressingly she lays her hand on my knee,
How strangely she tries to disown it, as it sinks
In my flesh and bone and forages into me,
How it stirs like a subtle stoat, whatever she
    thinks!

And often I see her clench her fingers tight
And thrust her fists suppressed in the folds of her
    skirt;
And sometimes, how she grasps her arms with her
    bright
Big hands, as if surely her arms did hurt.

And I have seen her stand all unaware
Pressing her spread hands over her breasts, as she
Would crush their mounds on her heart, to kill in
    there
The pain that is her simple ache for me.

Her strong hands take my part, the part of a man
To her; she crushes them into her bosom deep
Where I should lie, and with her own strong
    span
Closes her arms, that should fold me in sleep.

Ah, and she puts her hands upon the wall,
Presses them there, and kisses her bright hands,
Then lets her black hair loose, the darkness fall
About her from her maiden-folded bands.

And sits in her own dark night of her bitter hair
Dreaming -- God knows of what, for to me she's
    the same
Betrothed young lady who loves me, and takes care
Of her womanly virtue and of my good name.


EXCURSION

I WONDER, can the night go by;
Can this shot arrow of travel fly
Shaft-golden with light, sheer into the sky
    Of a dawned to-morrow,
Without ever sleep delivering us
From each other, or loosing the dolorous
    Unfruitful sorrow!

What is it then that you can see
That at the window endlessly
You watch the red sparks whirl and flee
    And the night look through?
Your presence peering lonelily there
Oppresses me so, I can hardly bear
    To share the train with you.

You hurt my heart-beats' privacy;
I wish I could put you away from me;
I suffocate in this intimacy,
    For all that I love you;
How I have longed for this night in the train,
Yet now every fibre of me cries in pain
    To God to remove you.

But surely my soul's best dream is still
That one night pouring down shall swill
Us away in an utter sleep, until
    We are one, smooth-rounded.
Yet closely bitten in to me
Is this armour of stiff reluctancy
    That keeps me impounded.

So, dear love, when another night
Pours on us, lift your fingers white
And strip me naked, touch me light,
    Light, light all over.
For I ache most earnestly for your touch,
Yet I cannot move, however much
    I would be your lover.

Night after night with a blemish of day
Unblown and unblossomed has withered away;
Come another night, come a new night, say
    Will you pluck me apart?
Will you open the amorous, aching bud
Of my body, and loose the burning flood
    That would leap to you from my heart?


PERFIDY

HOLLOW rang the house when I knocked on the door,
And I lingered on the threshold with my hand
Upraised to knock and knock once more:
Listening for the sound of her feet across the floor,
Hollow re-echoed my heart.

The low-hung lamps stretched down the road
With shadows drifting underneath,
With a music of soft, melodious feet
Quickening my hope as I hastened to meet
The low-hung light of her eyes.

The golden lamps down the street went out,
The last car trailed the night behind;
And I in the darkness wandered about
With a flutter of hope and of dark-shut doubt
In the dying lamp of my love.

Two brown ponies trotting slowly
Stopped at a dim-lit trough to drink:
The dark van drummed down the distance slowly;
While the city stars so dim and holy
Drew nearer to search through the streets.

A hastening car swept shameful past,
I saw her hid in the shadow,
I saw her step to the curb, and fast
Run to the silent door, where last
I had stood with my hand uplifted.
She clung to the door in her haste to enter,
Entered, and quickly cast
It shut behind her, leaving the street aghast.


A SPIRITUAL WOMAN

CLOSE your eyes, my love, let me make you blind;
       They have taught you to see
Only a mean arithmetic on the face of things,
A cunning algebra in the faces of men,
       And God like geometry
Completing his circles, and working cleverly.

I'll kiss you over the eyes till I kiss you blind;
       If I can -- if any one could.
Then perhaps in the dark you'll have got what you
         want to find.
You've discovered so many bits, with your clever
         eyes,
       And I'm a kaleidoscope
That you shake and shake, and yet it won't come to
         your mind.
Now stop carping at me. -- But God, how I hate you!
       Do you fear I shall swindle you?
Do you think if you take me as I am, that that will
         abate you
Somehow? -- so sad, so intrinsic, so spiritual, yet so
         cautious, you
Must have me all in your will and your consciousness -- 
       I hate you.


MATING

ROUND clouds roll in the arms of the wind,
The round earth rolls in a clasp of blue sky,
And see, where the budding hazels are thinned,
     The wild anemones lie
In undulating shivers beneath the wind.

Over the blue of the waters ply
White ducks, a living flotilla of cloud;
And, look you, floating just thereby,
     The blue-gleamed drake stems proud
Like Abraham, whose seed should multiply.

In the lustrous gleam of the water, there
Scramble seven toads across the silk, obscure leaves,
Seven toads that meet in the dusk to share
     The darkness that interweaves
The sky and earth and water and live things everywhere.

Look now, through the woods where the beech-green
     spurts
Like a storm of emerald snow, look, see
   A great bay stallion dances, skirts
     The bushes sumptuously,
Going outward now in the spring to his brief deserts.

Ah love, with your rich, warm face aglow,
What sudden expectation opens you
   So wide as you watch the catkins blow
     Their dust from the birch on the blue
Lift of the pulsing wind -- ah, tell me you know!

Ah, surely! Ah, sure from the golden sun
A quickening, masculine gleam floats in to all
   Us creatures, people and flowers undone,
     Lying open under his thrall,
As he begets the year in us. What, then, would you
       shun?

Why, I should think that from the earth there fly
Fine thrills to the neighbour stars, fine yellow beams
   Thrown lustily off from our full-blown, high
     Bursting globe of dreams,
To quicken the spheres that are virgin still in the sky.

Do you not hear each morsel thrill
With joy at travelling to plant itself within
   The expectant one, therein to instil
     New rapture, new shape to win,
From the thick of life wake up another will?

Surely, and if that I would spill
The vivid, ah, the fiery surplus of life,
   From off my brimming measure, to fill
     You, and flush you rife
With increase, do you call it evil, and always evil?



A LOVE SONG

REJECT me not if I should say to you
I do forget the sounding of your voice,
I do forget your eyes that searching through
The mists perceive our marriage, and rejoice.

Yet, when the apple-blossom opens wide
Under the pallid moonlight's fingering,
I see your blanched face at my breast, and hide
My eyes from diligent work, malingering.

Ah, then, upon my bedroom I do draw
The blind to hide the garden, where the moon
Enjoys the open blossoms as they straw
Their beauty for his taking, boon for boon.

And I do lift my aching arms to you,
And I do lift my anguished, avid breast,
And I do weep for very pain of you,
And fling myself at the doors of sleep, for rest.

And I do toss through the troubled night for you,
Dreaming your yielded mouth is given to mine,
Feeling your strong breast carry me on into
The peace where sleep is stronger even than wine.


BROTHER AND SISTER

THE shorn moon trembling indistinct on her path,
Frail as a scar upon the pale blue sky,
Draws towards the downward slope; some sorrow
     hath
Worn her down to the quick, so she faintly fares
Along her foot-searched way without knowing why
She creeps persistent down the sky's long stairs.

Some say they see, though I have never seen,
The dead moon heaped within the new moon's arms;
For surely the fragile, fine young thing had been
Too heavily burdened to mount the heavens so.
But my heart stands still, as a new, strong dread
     alarms
Me; might a young girl be heaped with such shadow
     of woe?

Since Death from the mother moon has pared us
     down to the quick,
And cast us forth like shorn, thin moons, to travel
An uncharted way among the myriad thick
Strewn stars of silent people, and luminous litter
Of lives which sorrows like mischievous dark mice
     chavel
To nought, diminishing each star's glitter,

Since Death has delivered us utterly, naked and
     white,
Since the month of childhood is over, and we stand
     alone,
Since the beloved, faded moon that set us alight
Is delivered from us and pays no heed though we
     moan
In sorrow, since we stand in bewilderment, strange
And fearful to sally forth down the sky's long range.

We may not cry to her still to sustain us here,
We may not hold her shadow back from the dark.
Oh, let us here forget, let us take the sheer
Unknown that lies before us, bearing the ark
Of the covenant onwards where she cannot go.
Let us rise and leave her now, she will never know.


AFTER MANY DAYS

I WONDER if with you, as it is with me,
If under your slipping words, that easily flow
About you as a garment, easily,
     Your violent heart beats to and fro!

Long have I waited, never once confessed,
Even to myself, how bitter the separation;
Now, being come again, how make the best
     Reparation?

If I could cast this clothing off from me,
If I could lift my naked self to you,
Or if only you would repulse me, a wound would be
     Good; it would let the ache come through.

But that you hold me still so kindly cold
Aloof my flaming heart will not allow;
Yea, but I loathe you that you should withhold
     Your pleasure now.


BLUE

THE earth again like a ship steams out of the dark
    sea over
The edge of the blue, and the sun stands up to see
    us glide
Slowly into another day; slowly the rover
Vessel of darkness takes the rising tide.

I, on the deck, am startled by this dawn confronting
Me who am issued amazed from the darkness,
    stripped
And quailing here in the sunshine, delivered from
    haunting
The night unsounded whereon our days are shipped.

Feeling myself undawning, the day's light playing
    upon me,
I who am substance of shadow, I all compact
Of the stuff of the night, finding myself all wrongly
Among the crowds of things in the sunshine jostled
    and racked.

I with the night on my lips, I sigh with the silence
    of death;
And what do I care though the very stones should
    cry me unreal, though the clouds
Shine in conceit of substance upon me, who am less
    than the rain.
Do I not know the darkness within them? What
    are they but shrouds?

The clouds go down the sky with a wealthy ease
Casting a shadow of scorn upon me for my share in
    death; but I
Hold my own in the midst of them, darkling, defy
The whole of the day to extinguish the shadow I lift
    on the breeze.

Yea, though the very clouds have vantage over
    me,
Enjoying their glancing flight, though my love is
    dead,
I still am not homeless here, I've a tent by day
Of darkness where she sleeps on her perfect bed.

And I know the host, the minute sparkling of darkness
Which vibrates untouched and virile through the
    grandeur of night,
But which, when dawn crows challenge, assaulting
    the vivid motes
Of living darkness, bursts fretfully, and is bright:

    Runs like a fretted arc-lamp into light,
    Stirred by conflict to shining, which else
    Were dark and whole with the night.

    Runs to a fret of speed like a racing wheel,
    Which else were aslumber along with the whole
    Of the dark, swinging rhythmic instead of a-reel.

    Is chafed to anger, bursts into rage like thunder;
    Which else were a silent grasp that held the
         heavens
    Arrested, beating thick with wonder.

    Leaps like a fountain of blue sparks leaping
    In a jet from out of obscurity,
    Which erst was darkness sleeping.

    Runs into streams of bright blue drops,
    Water and stones and stars, and myriads
    Of twin-blue eyes, and crops

    Of floury grain, and all the hosts of day,
    All lovely hosts of ripples caused by fretting
    The Darkness into play.


SNAP-DRAGON

SHE bade me follow to her garden, where
The mellow sunlight stood as in a cup
Between the old grey walls; I did not dare
To raise my face, I did not dare look up,
Lest her bright eyes like sparrows should fly in
My windows of discovery, and shrill Sin.

So with a downcast mien and laughing voice
I followed, followed the swing of her white dress
That rocked in a lilt along: I watched the poise
Of her feet as they flew for a space, then paused to
    press
The grass deep down with the royal burden of her:
And gladly I'd offered my breast to the tread of her.

I like to see, she said, and she crouched her down,
She sunk into my sight like a settling bird;
And her bosom couched in the confines of her gown
Like heavy birds at rest there, softly stirred
By her measured breaths: I like to see, said she,
The snap-dragon put out his tongue at me.

She laughed, she reached her hand out to the flower,
Closing its crimson throat. My own throat in her
    power
Strangled, my heart swelled up so full
As if it would burst its wine-skin in my throat,
Choke me in my own crimson. I watched her pull
The gorge of the gaping flower, till the blood did
float

      Over my eyes, and I was blind -- 
    Her large brown hand stretched over
    The windows of my mind;
    And there in the dark I did discover
    Things I was out to find:
    My Grail, a brown bowl twined
    With swollen veins that met in the wrist,
    Under whose brown the amethyst
    I longed to taste. I longed to turn
    My heart's red measure in her cup,
    I longed to feel my hot blood burn
    With the amethyst in her cup.

    Then suddenly she looked up,
    And I was blind in a tawny-gold day,
    Till she took her eyes away.
    So she came down from above
    And emptied my heart of love.
    So I held my heart aloft
    To the cuckoo that hung like a dove,
    And she settled soft

  It seemed that I and the morning world
  Were pressed cup-shape to take this reiver
  Bird who was weary to have furled
  Her wings in us,
  As we were weary to receive her.

         This bird, this rich,
         Sumptuous central grain,
         This mutable witch,
         This one refrain,
         This laugh in the fight,
         This clot of night,
         This core of delight.

  She spoke, and I closed my eyes
  To shut hallucinations out.
  I echoed with surprise
  Hearing my mere lips shout
  The answer they did devise.

    Again I saw a brown bird hover
    Over the flowers at my feet;
    I felt a brown bird hover
    Over my heart, and sweet
    Its shadow lay on my heart.
    I thought I saw on the clover
    A brown bee pulling apart
    The closed flesh of the clover
    And burrowing in its heart.

    She moved her hand, and again
    I felt the brown bird cover
    My heart; and then
    The bird came down on my heart,
    As on a nest the rover
    Cuckoo comes, and shoves over
    The brim each careful part
    Of love, takes possession, and settles her down,
    With her wings and her feathers to drown
    The nest in a heat of love.

She turned her flushed face to me for the glint
Of a moment. See, she laughed, if you also
Can make them yawn. I put my hand to the dint
In the flower's throat, and the flower gaped wide
    with woe.
She watched, she went of a sudden intensely still,
She watched my hand, to see what I would fulfil.

I pressed the wretched, throttled flower between
My fingers, till its head lay back, its fangs
Poised at her. Like a weapon my hand was white
    and keen,
And I held the choked flower-serpent in its pangs
Of mordant anguish, till she ceased to laugh,
Until her pride's flag, smitten, cleaved down to the
    staff.

She hid her face, she murmured between her lips
The low word Don't. I let the flower fall,
But held my hand afloat towards the slips
Of blossom she fingered, and my fingers all
Put forth to her: she did not move, nor I,
For my hand like a snake watched hers, that could
    not fly.

Then I laughed in the dark of my heart, I did exult
Like a sudden chuckling of music. I bade her eyes
Meet mine, I opened her helpless eyes to consult
Their fear, their shame, their joy that underlies
Defeat in such a battle. In the dark of her eyes
My heart was fierce to make her laughter rise.

Till her dark deeps shook with convulsive thrills, and
    the dark
Of her spirit wavered like water thrilled with light;
And my heart leaped up in longing to plunge its stark
Fervour within the pool of her twilight,
Within her spacious soul, to grope in delight.

And I do not care, though the large hands of revenge
Shall get my throat at last, shall get it soon,
If the joy that they are searching to avenge
Have risen red on my night as a harvest moon,
Which even death can only put out for me;
And death, I know, is better than not-to-be.


A PASSING BELL

MOURNFULLY to and fro, to and fro the trees are
      waving;
   _What did you say, my dear?_
The rain-bruised leaves are suddenly shaken, as a
      child
Asleep still shakes in the clutch of a sob -- 
   _Yes, my love, I hear._

One lonely bell, one only, the storm-tossed afternoon
      is braving,
   _Why not let it ring?_
The roses lean down when they hear it, the tender,
      mild
Flowers of the bleeding-heart fall to the throb -- 
   _It is such a little thing!_

A wet bird walks on the lawn, call to the boy to come
      and look,
   _Yes, it is over now._
Call to him out of the silence, call him to see
The starling shaking its head as it walks in the
      grass -- 
   _Ah, who knows how?_

He cannot see it, I can never show it him, how it
      shook -- 
   _Don't disturb him, darling._
 -- Its head as it walked: I can never call him to me,
Never, he _is_ not, whatever shall come to pass.
   _No, look at the wet starling._


IN TROUBLE AND SHAME

    I LOOK at the swaling sunset
    And wish I could go also
Through the red doors beyond the black-purple bar.

    I wish that I could go
Through the red doors where I could put off
    My shame like shoes in the porch,
    My pain like garments,
And leave my flesh discarded lying
Like luggage of some departed traveller
    Gone one knows not where.

    Then I would turn round,
And seeing my cast-off body lying like lumber,
    I would laugh with joy.


ELEGY

SINCE I lost you, my darling, the sky has come near,
And I am of it, the small sharp stars are quite near,
The white moon going among them like a white bird
    among snow-berries,
And the sound of her gently rustling in heaven like
    a bird I hear.

And I am willing to come to you now, my dear,
As a pigeon lets itself off from a cathedral dome
To be lost in the haze of the sky, I would like to
    come,
And be lost out of sight with you, and be gone like
    foam.

For I am tired, my dear, and if I could lift my feet,
My tenacious feet from off the dome of the earth
To fall like a breath within the breathing wind
Where you are lost, what rest, my love, what rest!


GREY EVENING

WHEN you went, how was it you carried with you
My missal book of fine, flamboyant hours?
My book of turrets and of red-thorn bowers,
And skies of gold, and ladies in bright tissue?

Now underneath a blue-grey twilight, heaped
Beyond the withering snow of the shorn fields
Stands rubble of stunted houses; all is reaped
And garnered that the golden daylight yields.

Dim lamps like yellow poppies glimmer among
The shadowy stubble of the under-dusk,
As farther off the scythe of night is swung,
And little stars come rolling from their husk.

And all the earth is gone into a dust
Of greyness mingled with a fume of gold,
Covered with aged lichens, pale with must,
And all the sky has withered and gone cold.

And so I sit and scan the book of grey,
Feeling the shadows like a blind man reading,
All fearful lest I find the last words bleeding
With wounds of sunset and the dying day.


FIRELIGHT AND NIGHTFALL

THE darkness steals the forms of all the queens,
But oh, the palms of his two black hands are red,
Inflamed with binding up the sheaves of dead
Hours that were once all glory and all queens.

And I remember all the sunny hours
Of queens in hyacinth and skies of gold,
And morning singing where the woods are scrolled
And diapered above the chaunting flowers.

Here lamps are white like snowdrops in the grass;
The town is like a churchyard, all so still
And grey now night is here; nor will
Another torn red sunset come to pass.


THE MYSTIC BLUE

OUT of the darkness, fretted sometimes in its sleeping,
Jets of sparks in fountains of blue come leaping
To sight, revealing a secret, numberless secrets keeping.

Sometimes the darkness trapped within a wheel
Runs into speed like a dream, the blue of the steel
Showing the rocking darkness now a-reel.

And out of the invisible, streams of bright blue drops
Rain from the showery heavens, and bright blue
    crops
Surge from the under-dark to their ladder-tops.

And all the manifold blue and joyous eyes,
The rainbow arching over in the skies,
New sparks of wonder opening in surprise.

All these pure things come foam and spray of the sea
Of Darkness abundant, which shaken mysteriously,
Breaks into dazzle of living, as dolphins that leap
    from the sea
Of midnight shake it to fire, so the secret of death
    we see.

Lustra of Ezra Pound


Tenzone


    Will people accept them?
              (i.e. these songs).
    As a timorous wench from a centaur
              (or a centurion),
    Already they flee, howling in terror.

    Will they be touched with the verisimilitudes?
              Their virgin stupidity is untemptable.
    I beg you, my friendly critics,
    Do not set about to procure me an audience.

    I mate with my free kind upon the crags;
              the hidden recesses
    Have heard the echo of my heels,
              in the cool light,
              in the darkness.




The Condolence

    O my fellow sufferers, songs of my youth,
    A lot of asses praise you because you are virile,
    We, you, I! We are Red Bloods!
    Imagine it, my fellow sufferers -- 
    Our maleness lifts us out of the ruck,
            Who'd have foreseen it?

    O my fellow sufferers, we went out under the trees,
    We were in especial bored with male stupidity.
    We went forth gathering delicate thoughts,
    Our _fantastikon_ delighted to serve us.
    We were not exasperated with women,
            for the female is ductile.

    And now you hear what is said to us:
    We are compared to that sort of person
    Who wanders about announcing his sex
    As if he had just discovered it.
    Let us leave this matter, my songs,
            and return to that which concerns us.




The Garret


    Come let us pity those who are better off than we are.
    Come, my friend, and remember
          that the rich have butlers and no friends,
    And we have friends and no butlers.
    Come let us pity the married and the unmarried.

    Dawn enters with little feet
          like a gilded Pavlova,
    And I am near my desire.
    Nor has life in it aught better
    Than this hour of clear coolness,
          the hour of waking together.

    Like a skein of loose silk blown against a wall
    She walks by the railing of a path in Kensington Gardens,
    And she is dying piece-meal
                      of a sort of emotional anaemia.

    And round about there is a rabble
    Of the filthy, sturdy, unkillable infants of the very poor.
    They shall inherit the earth.

    In her is the end of breeding.
    Her boredom is exquisite and excessive.
    She would like someone to speak to her,
    And is almost afraid that I
                      will commit that indiscretion.



Ortus


    How have I laboured?
    How have I not laboured
    To bring her soul to birth,
    To give these elements a name and a centre!

    She is beautiful as the sunlight, and as fluid.
    She has no name, and no place.
    How have I laboured to bring her soul into separation;
    To give her a name and her being!

    Surely you are bound and entwined,
    You are mingled with the elements unborn;
    I have loved a stream and a shadow.

    I beseech you enter your life.
    I beseech you learn to say I
    When I question you:
    For you are no part, but a whole;
    No portion, but a being.




Salutation


    O generation of the thoroughly smug
                    and thoroughly uncomfortable,
    I have seen fishermen picnicking in the sun,
    I have seen them with untidy families,
    I have seen their smiles full of teeth
                    and heard ungainly laughter.

    And I am happier than you are,
    And they were happier than I am;
    And the fish swim in the lake
                    and do not even own clothing.




The Spring


    Cydonian spring with her attendant train,
    Maelids and water-girls,
    Stepping beneath a boisterous wind from Thrace,
    Throughout this sylvan place
    Spreads the bright tips,
    And every vine-stock is
    Clad in new brilliancies.
                            And wild desire
    Falls like black lightning.
    O bewildered heart,
    Though every branch have back what last year lost,
    She, who moved here amid the cyclamen,
    Moves only now a clinging tenuous ghost.




Alb tre


    This lady in the white bath-robe which she calls a peignoir
    Is, for the time being, the mistress of my friend,
    And the delicate white feet of her little white dog
    Are not more delicate than she is,
    Nor would Gautier himself have despised their contrasts in whiteness
    As she sits in the great chair
    Between the two indolent candles.




Causa


    I join these words for four people,
    Some others may overhear them,
    O world, I am sorry for you,
    You do not know these four people.




A Pact


    I make a pact with you, Walt Whitman -- 
    I have detested you long enough.
    I come to you as a grown child
    Who has had a pig-headed father;
    I am old enough now to make friends.
    It was you that broke the new wood,
    Now is a time for carving.
    We have one sap and one root -- 
    Let there be commerce between us.




Surgit Fama


    There is a truce among the gods,
    Kor  is seen in the North
    Skirting the blue-gray sea
    In gilded and russet mantle.

    The corn has again its mother and she, Leucono ,
    That failed never women,
    Fails not the earth now.

    The tricksome Hermes is here;
    He moves behind me
    Eager to catch my words,
    Eager to spread them with rumour;
    To set upon them his change
    Crafty and subtle;
    To alter them to his purpose;
    But do thou speak true, even to the letter:

    Once more in Delos, once more is the altar a-quiver.
    Once more is the chant heard.
    Once more are the never abandoned gardens
    Full of gossip and old tales.




Preference


    It is true that you say the gods are more use to you than fairies,
    But for all that I have seen you
              on a high, white, noble horse,
    Like some strange queen in a story.

    It is odd that you should be covered with long robes
              and trailing tendrils and flowers;
    It is odd that you should be changing your face
              and resembling some other woman to plague me;
    It is odd that you should be hiding yourself
    In the cloud of beautiful women who do not concern me.

    And I, who follow every seed-leaf upon the wind?
    You will say that I deserve this.




Dance Figure

_For the Marriage in Cana of Galilee_


    Dark eyed,
    O woman of my dreams,
    Ivory sandaled,
    There is none like thee among the dancers,
    None with swift feet.

    I have not found thee in the tents,
    In the broken darkness.
    I have not found thee at the well-head
    Among the women with pitchers.

    Thine arms are as a young sapling under the bark;
    Thy face as a river with lights.

    White as an almond are thy shoulders;
    As new almonds stripped from the husk.

    They guard thee not with eunuchs;
    Not with bars of copper.

    Gilt turquoise and silver are in the place of thy rest.
    A brown robe, with threads of gold woven in patterns,
                hast thou gathered about thee,
    O Nathat-Ikanaie, Tree-at-the-river.

    As a rillet among the sedge are thy hands upon me;
    Thy fingers a frosted stream.

    Thy maidens are white like pebbles;
    Their music about thee!

    There is none like thee among the dancers;
    None with swift feet.




April

    RIGHT
    _Nympharum membra disjecta._


    Three spirits came to me
    And drew me apart
    To where the olive boughs
    Lay stripped upon the ground:
    Pale carnage beneath bright mist.




Gentildonna


    She passed and left no quiver in the veins, who now
    Moving among the trees, and clinging
                              in the air she severed,
    Fanning the grass she walked on then, endures:

    Grey olive leaves beneath a rain-cold sky.




The Rest


    O helpless few in my country,
    O remnant enslaved!

    Artists broken against her,
    A-stray, lost in the villages,
    Mistrusted, spoken-against,

    Lovers of beauty, starved,
    Thwarted with systems,
    Helpless against the control;

    You who can not wear yourselves out
    By persisting to successes,
    You who can only speak,
    Who can not steel yourselves into reiteration;

    You of the finer sense,
    Broken against false knowledge,
    You who can know at first hand,
    Hated, shut in, mistrusted:

    Take thought:
    I have weathered the storm,
    I have beaten out my exile.




Les Millwin


    The little Millwins attend the Russian Ballet.
    The mauve and greenish souls of the little Millwins
    Were seen lying along the upper seats
    Like so many unused boas.

    The turbulent and undisciplined host of art students -- 
    The rigorous deputation from Slade -- 
    Was before them.
    With arms exalted, with fore-arms
    Crossed in great futuristic X's, the art students
    Exulted, they beheld the splendours of _Cleopatra_.

    And the little Millwins beheld these things;
    With their large and anaemic eyes they looked out upon this configuration.

    Let us therefore mention the fact,
    For it seems to us worthy of record.




Further Instructions


    Come, my songs, let us express our baser passions,
    Let us express our envy of the man with a steady job
                      and no worry about the future.
    You are very idle, my songs.
    I fear you will come to a bad end.
    You stand about in the streets,
    You loiter at the corners and bus-stops
    You do next to nothing at all.

    You do not even express our inner nobilities,
    You will come to a very bad end.

    And I?
    I have gone half cracked,
    I have talked to you so much that
                      I almost see you about me,
    Insolent little beasts, shameless, devoid of clothing!

    But you, newest song of the lot,
    You are not old enough to have done much mischief,
    I will get you a green coat out of China
    With dragons worked upon it,
    I will get you the scarlet silk trousers
    From the statue of the infant Christ at Santa Maria Novella,
    Lest they say we are lacking in taste,
    Or that there is no caste in this family.




A Song of the Degrees



    Rest me with Chinese colours,
    For I think the glass is evil.



    The wind moves above the wheat -- 
    With a silver crashing,
    A thin war of metal.

    I have known the golden disc,
    I have seen it melting above me.
    I have known the stone-bright place,
            The hall of clear colours.




    O glass subtly evil, O confusion of colours!
    O light bound and bent in, O soul of the captive,
    Why am I warned? Why am I sent away?
    Why is your glitter full of curious mistrust?
    O glass subtle and cunning, O powdery gold!
    O filaments of amber, two-faced iridescence!




Ite


    Go, my songs, seek your praise from the young and from the intolerant,
    Move among the lovers of perfection alone.
    Seek ever to stand in the hard Sophoclean light
    And take your wounds from it gladly.




Dum Capitolium Scandet


    How many will come after me
        singing as well as I sing, none better;
    Telling the heart of their truth
        as I have taught them to tell it;
    Fruit of my seed,
        O my unnameable children.

    Know then that I loved you from afore-time,
    Clear speakers, naked in the sun, untrammelled.






    Even in my dreams you have denied yourself to me
    And sent me only your handmaids.




The Study in Aesthetics


    The very small children in patched clothing,
    Being smitten with an unusual wisdom,
    Stopped in their play as she passed them
    And cried up from their cobbles:


    But three years after this
    I heard the young Dante, whose last name I do not know -- 
    For there are, in Sirmione, twenty-eight young
    Dantes and thirty-four Catulli;

    And there had been a great catch of sardines,
    And his elders
    Were packing them in the great wooden boxes
    For the market in Brescia, and he
    Leapt about, snatching at the bright fish
    And getting in both of their ways;
    And in vain they commanded him to _sta fermo!_
    And when they would not let him arrange
    The fish in the boxes
    He stroked those which were already arranged,
    Murmuring for his own satisfaction
    This identical phrase:


    And at this I was mildly abashed.






The Bellaires

    RIGHT



    The good Bellaires
    Do not understand the conduct of this world's affairs.
    In fact they understood them so badly
    That they have had to cross the Channel.

    Nine lawyers, four counsels, five judges and three proctors of the King,
    Together with the respective wives, husbands, sisters
         and heterogeneous connections of the good Bellaires,
    Met to discuss their affairs;
    But the good Bellaires have so little understood their affairs
    That now there is no one at all
    Who can understand any affair of theirs. Yet
    Fourteen hunters still eat in the stables of
    The good Squire Bellaire;
    But these may not suffer attainder,
    For they may not belong to the good Squire Bellaire
    But to his wife.
    On the contrary, if they do not belong to his wife,
    He will plead
    A freedom from attainder
    For twelve horses and also for twelve boarhounds
    From Charles the Fourth;
    And a further freedom for the remainder
    Of horses, from Henry the Fourth.
    But the judges,
    Being free of mediaeval scholarship,
    Will pay no attention to this,
    And there will be only the more confusion,
    Replevin, estoppel, espavin and what not.

    Nine lawyers, four counsels, etc.,
    Met to discuss their affairs,
    But the sole result was bills
    From lawyers to whom no one was indebted,
    And even the lawyers
    Were uncertain who was supposed to be indebted to them.

    Wherefore the good Squire Bellaire
    Resides now at Agde and Biaucaire.
    To Carcassonne, Pui, and Alais
    He fareth from day to day,
    Or takes the sea air
    Between Marseilles
    And Beziers.

    And for all this I have considerable regret,
    For the good Bellaires
    Are very charming people.




Salvationists



    Come, my songs, let us speak of perfection -- 
    We shall get ourselves rather disliked.



    Ah yes, my songs, let us resurrect
    The very excellent term _Rusticus_.
    Let us apply it in all its opprobrium
    To those to whom it applies.
    And you may decline to make them immortal.
    For we shall consider them and their state
    In delicate
    Opulent silence.


    Come, my songs,
    Let us take arms against this sea of stupidities -- 
    Beginning with Mumpodorus;
    And against this sea of vulgarities -- 
    Beginning with Nimmim;
    And against this sea of imbeciles -- 
    All the Bulmenian literati.




Arides


    The bashful Arides
    Has married an ugly wife,
    He was bored with his manner of life,
    Indifferent and discouraged he thought he might as
    Well do this as anything else.

    Saying within his heart, I am no use to myself,
    Let her, if she wants me, take me.
    He went to his doom.




The Bath Tub


    As a bathtub lined with white porcelain,
    When the hot water gives out or goes tepid,
    So is the slow cooling of our chivalrous passion,
    O my much praised but-not-altogether-satisfactory lady.




Amiti s

    RIGHT





_To one, on returning certain years after._

    You wore the same quite correct clothing,
    You took no pleasure at all in my triumphs,
    You had the same old air of condescension
    Mingled with a curious fear
          That I, myself, might have enjoyed them.

you also shall be immortal.



_To another._

    And we say good-bye to you also,
    For you seem never to have discovered
    That your relationship is wholly parasitic;
    Yet to our feasts you bring neither
    Wit, nor good spirits, nor the pleasing attitudes
          Of discipleship.




    But you, _bos amic_, we keep on,
    For to you we owe a real debt:
    In spite of your obvious flaws,
    You once discovered a moderate chop-house.






To Dives


    Who am I to condemn you, O Dives,
    I who am as much embittered
    With poverty
    As you are with useless riches?




Ladies


_Agathas_

    Four and forty lovers had Agathas in the old days,
    All of whom she refused;
    And now she turns to me seeking love,
    And her hair also is turning.


_Young Lady_

    I have fed your lar with poppies,
    I have adored you for three full years;
    And now you grumble because your dress does not fit
    And because I happen to say so.


_Lesbia Illa_

    Memnon, Memnon, that lady
    Who used to walk about amongst us
    With such gracious uncertainty,
    Is now wedded
    To a British householder.
    _Lugete, Veneres! Lugete, Cupidinesque!_


_Passing_

    Flawless as Aphrodite,
    Thoroughly beautiful,
    Brainless,
    The faint odour of your patchouli,
    Faint, almost, as the lines of cruelty about your chin,
    Assails me, and concerns me almost as little.




Coda


    O my songs,
    Why do you look so eagerly and so curiously into people's faces,
    Will you find your lost dead among them?




Ancora


    Good God! They say you are _

    We who went out into the four A.M. of the world
    Composing our albas,
    We who shook off our dew with the rabbits,
    We who have seen even Artemis a-binding her sandals,
    Have we ever heard the like?
    O mountains of Hellas!!

    Gather about me, O Muses!
    When we sat upon the granite brink in Helicon
    Clothed in the tattered sunlight,
    O Muses with delicate shins,
    O Muses with delectable knee-joints,
    When we splashed and were splashed with
    The lucid Castalian spray,
    Had we ever such an epithet cast upon us!!




A TRANSLATION

FROM THE PROVEN AL OF EN BERTRANS DE BORN.


    Lady, since you care nothing for me,
    And since you have shut me away from you
    Causelessly,
    I know not where to go seeking,
    For certainly
    I will never again gather
    Joy so rich, and if I find not ever
    A lady with look so speaking
    To my desire, worth yours whom I have lost,
    I'll have no other love at any cost.

    And since I could not find a peer to you,
    Neither one so fair, nor of such heart,
    So eager and alert,
    Nor with such art
    In attire, nor so gay
    Nor with gift so bountiful and so true,
    I will go out a-searching,
    Culling from each a fair trait
    To make me a borrowed lady
    Till I again find you ready.

    Bels Cembelins, I take of you your colour,
    For it's your own, and your glance
    Where love is,
    A proud thing I do here,
    For, as to colour and eyes
    I shall have missed nothing at all,
    Having yours.
    I ask of Midons Aelis (of Montfort)
    Her straight speech free-running,
    That my phantom lack not in cunning.

    At Chalais of the Viscountess, I would
    That she give me outright
    Her two hands and her throat,
    So take I my road
    To Rochechouart,
    Swift-foot to my Lady Anhes,
    Seeing that Tristan's lady Iseutz had never
    Such grace of locks, I do ye to wit,
    Though she'd the far fame for it.

    Of Audiart at Malemort,
    Though she with a full heart
    Wish me ill,
    I'd have her form that's laced
    So cunningly,
    Without blemish, for her love
    Breaks not nor turns aside.
    I of Miels-de-ben demand
    Her straight fresh body,
    She is so supple and young,
    Her robes can but do her wrong.

    Her white teeth, of the Lady Faidita
    I ask, and the fine courtesy
    She hath to welcome one,
    And such replies she lavishes
    Within her nest;
    Of Bels Mirals, the rest,
    Tall stature and gaiety,
    To make these avail
    She knoweth well, betide
    No change nor turning aside.

    Ah, Bels Senher, Maent, at last
    I ask naught from you,
    Save that I have such hunger for
    This phantom
    As I've for you, such flame-lap,
    And yet I'd rather
    Ask of you than hold another,
    Mayhap, right close and kissed.
    Ah, lady, why have you cast
    Me out, knowing you hold me so fast!




The Coming of War: Actaeon


    An image of Lethe,
            and the fields
    Full of faint light
            but golden,
    Gray cliffs,
            and beneath them
    A sea
    Harsher than granite,
            unstill, never ceasing;
    High forms
            with the movement of gods,
    Perilous aspect;
            And one said:
    This is Actaeon.
            Actaeon of golden greaves!

    Over fair meadows,
    Over the cool face of that field,
    Unstill, ever moving,
    Hosts of an ancient people,
    The silent cort ge.




After Ch'u Yuan


    I will get me to the wood
    Where the gods walk garlanded in wistaria,
    By the silver blue flood
      move others with ivory cars.
    There come forth many maidens
      to gather grapes for the leopards, my friend,
    For there are leopards drawing the cars.

    I will walk in the glade,
    I will come out of the new thicket
      and accost the procession of maidens.




Liu Ch'e


    The rustling of the silk is discontinued,
    Dust drifts over the court-yard,
    There is no sound of foot-fall, and the leaves
    Scurry into heaps and lie still,
    And she the rejoicer of the heart is beneath them:

    A wet leaf that clings to the threshold.




Fan-piece, for her Imperial Lord


    O fan of white silk,
          clear as frost on the grass-blade,
    You also are laid aside.




Ts'ai Chi'h


    The petals fall in the fountain,
            the orange-coloured rose-leaves,
    Their ochre clings to the stone.




In a Station of the Metro


    The apparition of these faces in the crowd;
    Petals on a wet, black bough.




Alba


    As cool as the pale wet leaves
                        of lily-of-the-valley
    She lay beside me in the dawn.




Heather


    The black panther treads at my side,
    And above my fingers
    There float the petal-like flames.

    The milk-white girls
    Unbend from the holly-trees,
    And their snow-white leopard
    Watches to follow our trace.




The Faun


    Ha! sir, I have seen you sniffing and snoozling about
                              among my flowers.
    And what, pray, do you know about horticulture,
                              you capriped?

    Come, Auster, come, Apeliota,
    And see the faun in our garden.
    But if you move or speak
    This thing will run at you
    And scare itself to spasms.




Pervigilium

    The gilded phaloi of the crocuses
            are thrusting at the spring air.
    Here is there naught of dead gods
    But a procession of festival,
    A procession, O Giulio Romano,
    Fit for your spirit to dwell in.
    Dione, your nights are upon us.

    The dew is upon the leaf.
    The night about us is restless.




The Encounter


    All the while they were talking the new morality
    Her eyes explored me.
    And when I arose to go
    Her fingers were like the tissue
    Of a Japanese paper napkin.




Tempora


    Io! Io! Tamuz!
    The Dryad stands in my court-yard
    With plaintive, querulous crying.
    (Tamuz. Io! Tamuz!)
    Oh, no, she is not crying: Tamuz.
    She says, May my poems be printed this week?
    The god Pan is afraid to ask you,
    May my poems be printed this week?




Black Slippers: Bellotti


        At the table beyond us
        With her little suede slippers off,
        With her white-stocking'd feet
        Carefully kept from the floor by a napkin,
        She converses:

    The gurgling Italian lady on the other side of the restaurant
    Replies with a certain hauteur,
    But I await with patience
    To see how Celestine will re-enter her slippers.
    She re-enters them with a groan.




Society


    The family position was waning,
    And on this account the little Aurelia,
    Who had laughed on eighteen summers,
    Now bears the palsied contact of Phidippus.




Image from D'Orleans


    Young men riding in the street
    In the bright new season
    Spur without reason,
    Causing their steeds to leap.

    And at the pace they keep
    Their horses' armoured feet
    Strike sparks from the cobbled street
    In the bright new season.

    Spring ...
    Too long ...

Ione, Dead the Long Year


    Empty are the ways,
    Empty are the ways of this land
    And the flowers
                Bend over with heavy heads.
    They bend in vain.
    Empty are the ways of this land
                Where Ione
    Walked once, and now does not walk

    But seems like a person just gone.




Shop Girl


    For a moment she rested against me
    Like a swallow half blown to the wall,
    And they talk of Swinburne's women,
    And the shepherdess meeting with Guido,
    And the harlots of Baudelaire.




To Formianus' Young Lady Friend


    All Hail! young lady with a nose
                  by no means too small,
    With a foot unbeautiful,
                  and with eyes that are not black,
    With fingers that are not long, and with a mouth undry,
    And with a tongue by no means too elegant,
    You are the friend of Formianus, the vendor of cosmetics,
    And they call you beautiful in the province,
    And you are even compared to Lesbia.

    O most unfortunate age!




Tame Cat


    It rests me to be among beautiful women.
    Why should one always lie about such matters?

    I repeat:
    It rests me to converse with beautiful women
    Even though we talk nothing but nonsense,

    The purring of the invisible antennae
    Is both stimulating and delightful.




L'Art, 1910


    Green arsenic smeared on an egg-white cloth,
    Crushed strawberries! Come, let us feast our eyes.




Simulacra


    Why does the horse-faced lady of just the unmentionable age
    Walk down Longacre reciting Swinburne to herself, inaudibly?
    Why does the small child in the soiled-white imitation fur coat
    Crawl in the very black gutter beneath the grape stand?
    Why does the really handsome young woman approach me in Sackville Street
    Undeterred by the manifest age of my trappings?




Women Before a Shop


    The gew-gaws of false amber and false turquoise attract them.
    Like to like nature: these agglutinous yellows!




Epilogue


    O chansons foregoing
    You were a seven days' wonder,
    When you came out in the magazines
    You created considerable stir in Chicago,

    And now you are stale and worn out,
    You're a very depleted fashion,
    A hoop-skirt, a calash,
    An homely, transient antiquity.

    Only emotion remains.

    Your emotions?
                    Are those of a ma tre-de-caf .




The Social Order




    This government official,
    Whose wife is several years his senior,
    Has such a caressing air
    When he shakes hands with young ladies.




    This old lady,
    Who was so old that she was an atheist,
    Is now surrounded
    By six candles and a crucifix,
    While the second wife of a nephew
    Makes hay with the things in her house.
    Her two cats
    Go before her into Avernus;
    A sort of chloroformed suttee,
    And it is to be hoped that their spirits will walk
    With their tails up,
    And with a plaintive, gentle mewing,
    For it is certain that she has left on this earth
    No sound
    Save a squabble of female connections.




The Tea Shop


    The girl in the tea shop
                      is not so beautiful as she was,
    The August has worn against her.
    She does not get up the stairs so eagerly,
    Yes, she also will turn middle-aged,
    And the glow of youth that she spread about us
                      as she brought us our muffins
    Will be spread about us no longer.
                      She also will turn middle-aged.

Our Contemporaries


    When the Taihaitian princess
    Heard that he had decided,
    She rushed out into the sunlight and swarmed up a cocoanut palm tree,

    But he returned to this island
    And wrote ninety Petrarchan sonnets.

Ancient Wisdom, Rather Cosmic


    So-shu dreamed,
    And having dreamed that he was a bird, a bee, and a butterfly,
    He was uncertain why he should try to feel like anything else,

    Hence his contentment.




The Three Poets


    Candidia has taken a new lover
    And three poets are gone into mourning.
    The first has written a long elegy to Chloris,
    To Chloris chaste and cold, his only Chloris.
    The second has written a sonnet
                    upon the mutability of woman,
    And the third writes an epigram to Candidia.




The Gipsy

    That was the top of the walk, when he said:
    Have you seen any others, any of our lot,
    With apes or bears?
                 -- A brown upstanding fellow
    Not like the half-castes,
                  up on the wet road near Clermont.
    The wind came, and the rain,
    And mist clotted about the trees in the valley,
    And I'd the long ways behind me,
                  gray Arles and Biaucaire,
    And he said, Have you seen any of our lot?

    I'd seen a lot of his lot ...
                  ever since Rhodez,
    Coming down from the fair
                  of St. John,
    With caravans, but never an ape or a bear.




The Game of Chess

DOGMATIC STATEMENT CONCERNING THE GAME OF CHESS: THEME FOR A
SERIES OF
PICTURES


    Red knights, brown bishops, bright queens,
    striking the board, falling in strong Ls of colour,
    Reaching and striking in angles,
                  holding lines in one colour.
    This board is alive with light;
                  these pieces are living in form,
    Their moves break and reform the pattern:
                  Luminous green from the rooks,
    Clashing with Xs of queens,
                  looped with the knight-leaps.

    Y pawns, cleaving, embanking!
    Whirl! Centripetal! Mate! King down in the vortex,
    Clash, leaping of bands, straight strips of hard colour,
    Blocked lights working in. Escapes. Renewal of contest.




Provincia Deserta


    At Rochecoart,
    Where the hills part
                  in three ways,
    And three valleys, full of winding roads,
    Fork out to south and north,
    There is a place of trees ... gray with lichen.
    I have walked there
                  thinking of old days.
    At Chalais
                  is a pleached arbour;
    Old pensioners and old protected women
    Have the right there -- 
                  it is charity.
    I have crept over old rafters,
                  peering down
    Over the Dronne,
                  over a stream full of lilies.
    Eastward the road lies,
                  Aubeterre is eastward,
    With a garrulous old man at the inn.

    I know the roads in that place:
    Mareuil to the north-east,
                  La Tour,
    There are three keeps near Mareuil,
    And an old woman,
                  glad to hear Arnaut,
    Glad to lend one dry clothing.

    I have walked
                  into Perigord,
    I have seen the torch-flames, high-leaping,
    Painting the front of that church,
    And, under the dark, whirling laughter.
    I have looked back over the stream
                  and seen the high building,
    Seen the long minarets, the white shafts.
    I have gone in Ribeyrac
                  and in Sarlat,
    I have climbed rickety stairs, heard talk of Croy,
    Walked over En Bertran's old layout,
    Have seen Narbonne, and Cahors and Chalus,
    Have seen Excideuil, carefully fashioned.

    I have said:
                  Here such a one walked.
    Here Coeur-de-Lion was slain.
                  Here was good singing.
    Here one man hastened his step.
                  Here one lay panting.

    I have looked south from Hautefort,
                  thinking of Montaignac, southward.
    I have lain in Rocafixada,
                  level with sunset,
    Have seen the copper come down
                  tinging the mountains,
    I have seen the fields, pale, clear as an emerald,
    Sharp peaks, high spurs, distant castles.
    I have said: The old roads have lain here.
    Men have gone by such and such valleys
    Where the great halls are closer together.
    I have seen Foix on its rock, seen Toulouse, and Arles greatly altered,
    I have seen the ruined Dorata.
                  I have said:
    Riquier! Guido.
                  I have thought of the second Troy,
    Some little prized place in Auvergnat:
    Two men tossing a coin, one keeping a castle,
    One set on the highway to sing.
                  He sang a woman.
    Auvergne rose to the song;
                  The Dauphin backed him.
    The castle to Austors!
                  Pieire kept the singing -- 
    A fair man and a pleasant.
                  He won the lady,
    Stole her away for himself, kept her against armed force:
    So ends that story.
    That age is gone;
    Pieire de Maensac is gone.
    I have walked over these roads;
    I have thought of them living.





CATHAY



Song of the Bowmen of Shu


    Here we are, picking the first fern-shoots
    And saying: When shall we get back to our country?
    Here we are because we have the Ken-nin for our foemen,
    We have no comfort because of these Mongols.
    We grub the soft fern-shoots,
    When anyone says Return, the others are full of sorrow.
    Sorrowful minds, sorrow is strong, we are hungry and thirsty.
    Our defence is not yet made sure, no one can let his friend return.
    We grub the old fern-stalks.
    We say: Will we be let to go back in October?
    There is no ease in royal affairs, we have no comfort.
    Our sorrow is bitter, but we would not return to our country.
    What flower has come into blossom?
    Whose chariot? The General's.
    Horses, his horses even, are tired. They were strong.
    We have no rest, three battles a month.
    By heaven, his horses are tired.
    The generals are on them, the soldiers are by them
    The horses are well trained, the generals have ivory arrows
         and quivers ornamented with fish-skin.
    The enemy is swift, we must be careful.
    When we set out, the willows were drooping with spring,
    We come back in the snow,
    We go slowly, we are hungry and thirsty,
    Our mind is full of sorrow, who will know of our grief?





The Beautiful Toilet


    Blue, blue is the grass about the river
    And the willows have overfilled the close garden.
    And within, the mistress, in the midmost of her youth,
    White, white of face, hesitates, passing the door.
    Slender, she puts forth a slender hand,

    And she was a courtezan in the old days,
    And she has married a sot,
    Who now goes drunkenly out
    And leaves her too much alone.




The River Song


    This boat is of shato-wood, and its gunwales are cut magnolia,
    Musicians with jewelled flutes and with pipes of gold
    Fill full the sides in rows, and our wine
    Is rich for a thousand cups.
    We carry singing girls, drift with the drifting water,
    Yet Sennin needs
    A yellow stork for a charger, and all our seamen
    Would follow the white gulls or ride them.
    Kutsu's prose song
    Hangs with the sun and moon.

    King So's terraced palace
                          is now but a barren hill,
    But I draw pen on this barge
    Causing the five peaks to tremble,
    And I have joy in these words
                          like the joy of blue islands.
    (If glory could last forever
    Then the waters of Han would flow northward.)
    And I have moped in the Emperor's garden, awaiting an order-to-write!
    I looked at the dragon-pond, with its willow-coloured water
    Just reflecting the sky's tinge,
    And heard the five-score nightingales aimlessly singing.

    The eastern wind brings the green colour into the
         island grasses at Yei-shu,
    The purple house and the crimson are full of Spring softness.
    South of the pond the willow-tips are half-blue and bluer,
    Their cords tangle in mist, against the brocade-like palace.
    Vine-strings a hundred feet long hang down from carved railings,
    And high over the willows, the fine birds sing to each other, and listen,
    Crying -- Kwan, Kuan, for the early wind, and the feel of it.
    The wind bundles itself into a bluish cloud and wanders off.
    Over a thousand gates, over a thousand doors are
         the sounds of spring singing,
    And the Emperor is at Ko.
    Five clouds hang aloft, bright on the purple sky,
    The imperial guards come forth from the golden
         house with their armour a-gleaming.
    The Emperor in his jewelled car goes out to inspect his flowers,
    He goes out to Hori, to look at the wing-flapping storks,
    He returns by way of Sei rock, to hear the new nightingales,
    For the gardens at Jo-run are full of new nightingales,
    Their sound is mixed in this flute,
    Their voice is in the twelve pipes here.




The River-Merchant's Wife: a Letter


    While my hair was still cut straight across my forehead
    I played about the front gate, pulling flowers
    You came by on bamboo stilts, playing horse,
    You walked about my seat, playing with blue plums.
    And we went on living in the village of Chokan:
    Two small people, without dislike or suspicion.

    At fourteen I married My Lord you.
    I never laughed, being bashful.
    Lowering my head, I looked at the wall.
    Called to, a thousand times, I never looked back.

    At fifteen I stopped scowling,
    I desired my dust to be mingled with yours
    Forever and forever, and forever.
    Why should I climb the look out?

    At sixteen you departed,
    You went into far Ku-to-Yen, by the river of swirling eddies,
    And you have been gone five months.
    The monkeys make sorrowful noise overhead.
    You dragged your feet when you went out.
    By the gate now, the moss is grown, the different mosses,
    Too deep to clear them away!
    The leaves fall early this autumn, in wind.
    The paired butterflies are already yellow with August
    Over the grass in the West garden,
    They hurt me.
    I grow older,
    If you are coming down through the narrows of the river Kiang,
    Please let me know beforehand,
    And I will come out to meet you,
                    As far as Cho-fu-Sa.


The Jewel Stairs' Grievance


    The jewelled steps are already quite white with dew,
    It is so late that the dew soaks my gauze stockings,
    And I let down the crystal curtain
    And watch the moon through the clear autumn.



Poem by the Bridge at Ten-Shin


    March has come to the bridge head,
    Peach boughs and apricot boughs hang over a thousand gates,
    At morning there are flowers to cut the heart,
    And evening drives them on the eastward-flowing waters.
    Petals are on the gone waters and on the going,
              And on the back-swirling eddies,
    But to-day's men are not the men of the old days,
    Though they hang in the same way over the bridge-rail.

    The sea's colour moves at the dawn
    And the princes still stand in rows, about the throne,
    And the moon falls over the portals of Sei-go-yo,
    And clings to the walls and the gate-top.
    With head gear glittering against the cloud and sun,
    The lords go forth from the court, and into far borders.
    They ride upon dragon-like horses,
    Upon horses with head-trappings of yellow metal,
    And the streets make way for their passage.
              Haughty their passing,
    Haughty their steps as they go into great banquets,
    To high halls and curious food,
    To the perfumed air and girls dancing,
    To clear flutes and clear singing;
    To the dance of the seventy couples;
    To the mad chase through the gardens.
    Night and day are given over to pleasure
    And they think it will last a thousand autumns,
              Unwearying autumns.
    For them the yellow dogs howl portents in vain,
    And what are they compared to the lady
        Riokushu,
              That was cause of hate!
    Who among them is a man like Han-rei
              Who departed alone with his mistress,
    With her hair unbound, and he his own skiffsman!





Lament of the Frontier Guard


    By the North Gate, the wind blows full of sand,
    Lonely from the beginning of time until now!
    Trees fall, the grass goes yellow with autumn.
    I climb the towers and towers
          to watch out the barbarous land:
    Desolate castle, the sky, the wide desert.
    There is no wall left to this village.
    Bones white with a thousand frosts,
    High heaps, covered with trees and grass;
    Who brought this to pass?
    Who has brought the flaming imperial anger?
    Who has brought the army with drums and with kettle-drums?
    Barbarous kings.
    A gracious spring, turned to blood-ravenous autumn,
    A turmoil of wars-men, spread over the middle kingdom,
    Three hundred and sixty thousand,
    And sorrow, sorrow like rain.
    Sorrow to go, and sorrow, sorrow returning,
    Desolate, desolate fields,
    And no children of warfare upon them,
          No longer the men for offence and defence.
    Ah, how shall you know the dreary sorrow at the
          North Gate,
    With Rihoku's name forgotten,
    And we guardsmen fed to the tigers.





Exile's Letter


    To So-Kin of Rakuyo, ancient friend, Chancellor of Gen.
    Now I remember that you built me a special tavern
    By the south side of the bridge at Ten-Shin.
    With yellow gold and white jewels, we paid for songs and laughter
    And we were drunk for month on month, forgetting the kings and princes.
    Intelligent men came drifting in from the sea and from the west border,
    And with them, and with you especially
    There was nothing at cross purpose,
    And they made nothing of sea-crossing or of mountain crossing,
    If only they could be of that fellowship,
    And we all spoke out our hearts and minds, and without regret.

    And then I was sent off to South Wei,
          smothered in laurel groves,
    And you to the north of Raku-hoku,
    Till we had nothing but thoughts and memories in common.
    And then, when separation had come to its worst,
    We met, and travelled into Sen-Go,
    Through all the thirty-six folds of the turning and twisting waters,
    Into a valley of the thousand bright flowers,
    That was the first valley;
    And into ten thousand valleys full of voices and pine-winds.
    And with silver harness and reins of gold,
    Out come the East of Kan foreman and his company.
    And there came also the True man of Shi-yo to meet me,
    Playing on a jewelled mouth-organ.
    In the storied houses of San-Ko they gave us more Sennin music,
    Many instruments, like the sound of young phoenix broods.
    The foreman of Kan Chu, drunk, danced
                because his long sleeves wouldn't
                  keep still
    With that music playing.
    And I, wrapped in brocade, went to sleep with my head on his lap,
    And my spirit so high it was all over the heavens,
    And before the end of the day we were scattered like stars, or rain.
    I had to be off to So, far away over the waters,
    You back to your river-bridge.

    And your father, who was brave as a leopard,
    Was governor in Hei Shu, and put down the barbarian rabble.
    And one May he had you send for me,
          despite the long distance.
    And what with broken wheels and so on, I won't say it wasn't hard going,
    Over roads twisted like sheep's guts.
    And I was still going, late in the year,
          in the cutting wind from the North,
    And thinking how little you cared for the cost,
          and you caring enough to pay it.
    And what a reception:
    Red jade cups, food well set on a blue jewelled table,
    And I was drunk, and had no thought of returning.
    And you would walk out with me to the western corner of the castle,
    To the dynastic temple, with water about it clear as blue jade,
    With boats floating, and the sound of mouth-organs and drums,
    With ripples like dragon-scales, going grass green on the water,
    Pleasure lasting, with courtezans, going and coming without hindrance,
    With the willow flakes falling like snow,
    And the vermilioned girls getting drunk about sunset,
    And the water a hundred feet deep reflecting green eyebrows
    -- Eyebrows painted green are a fine sight in young moonlight,
    Gracefully painted -- 
    And the girls singing back at each other,
    Dancing in transparent brocade,
    And the wind lifting the song, and interrupting it,
    Tossing it up under the clouds.
          And all this comes to an end.
          And is not again to be met with.
    I went up to the court for examination,
    Tried Layu's luck, offered the Choyo song,
    And got no promotion,
          and went back to the East Mountains
                white-headed.
    And once again, later, we met at the South bridge-head.
    And then the crowd broke up, you went north to
        San palace,
    And if you ask how I regret that parting:
          It is like the flowers falling at Spring's end
                Confused, whirled in a tangle.
    What is the use of talking, and there is no end of talking,
    There is no end of things in the heart.
    I call in the boy,
    Have him sit on his knees here
              To seal this,
    And send it a thousand miles, thinking.


FOUR POEMS OF DEPARTURE

    _Light rain is on the light dust
    The willows of the inn-yard
    Will be going greener and greener,
    But you, Sir, had better take wine ere your departure,
    For you will have no friends about you
    When you come to the gates of Go._




Separation on the River Kiang


    Ko-jin goes west from Ko-kaku-ro,
    The smoke-flowers are blurred over the river.
    His lone sail blots the far sky.
    And now I see only the river,
            The long Kiang, reaching heaven.




Taking Leave of a Friend


    Blue mountains to the north of the walls,
    White river winding about them;
    Here we must make separation
    And go out through a thousand miles of dead grass.
    Mind like a floating wide cloud.
    Sunset like the parting of old acquaintances
    Who bow over their clasped hands at a distance.
    Our horses neigh to each other
            as we are departing.




Leave-taking near Shoku

    RIGHT
    _Sanso, King of Shoku, built roads._


    They say the roads of Sanso are steep,
    Sheer as the mountains.
    The walls rise in a man's face,
    Clouds grow out of the hill
            at his horse's bridle.
    Sweet trees are on the paved way of the Shin,
    Their trunks burst through the paving,
    And freshets are bursting their ice
            in the midst of Shoku, a proud city.

    Men's fates are already set,
    There is no need of asking diviners.




The City of Choan


    The phoenix are at play on their terrace.
    The phoenix are gone, the river flows on alone.
    Flowers and grass
    Cover over the dark path
            where lay the dynastic house of the Go.
    The bright cloths and bright caps of Shin
    Are now the base of old hills.

    The Three Mountains fall through the far heaven,
    The isle of White Heron
            splits the two streams apart.
    Now the high clouds cover the sun
    And I can not see Choan afar
    And I am sad.




South-Folk in Cold Country


    The Dai horse neighs against the bleak wind of Etsu,
    The birds of Etsu have no love for En, in the north,
    Emotion is born out of habit.
    Yesterday we went out of the Wild-Goose gate,
    To-day from the Dragon-Pen.
    Surprised. Desert turmoil. Sea sun.
    Flying snow bewilders the barbarian heaven.
    Lice swarm like ants over our accoutrements.
    Mind and spirit drive on the feathery banners.
    Hard fight gets no reward.
    Loyalty is hard to explain.
    Who will be sorry for General Rishogu,
            the swift moving,
    Whose white head is lost for this province?



    The red and green kingfishers
              flash between the orchids and clover,
    One bird casts its gleam on another.

    Green vines hang through the high forest,
    They weave a whole roof to the mountain,
    The lone man sits with shut speech,
    He purrs and pats the clear strings.

    He throws his heart up through the sky,
    He bites through the flower pistil
              and brings up a fine fountain.
    The red-pine-tree god looks on him and wonders.
    He rides through the purple smoke to visit the sennin,
    He takes Floating Hill by the sleeve,
    He claps his hand on the back of the great water sennin.

    But you, you dam'd crowd of gnats,
    Can you even tell the age of a turtle?






A Ballad of the Mulberry Road

    RIGHT


    The sun rises in south east corner of things
    To look on the tall house of the Shin
    For they have a daughter named Rafu,
            (pretty girl)
    She made the name for herself: Gauze Veil,
    For she feeds mulberries to silkworms,
        She gets them by the south wall of the
              town.

    With green strings she makes the warp of her basket,
    She makes the shoulder-straps of her basket
            from the boughs of Katsura,
    And she piles her hair up on the left side of her head-piece.

    Her earrings are made of pearl,
    Her underskirt is of green pattern-silk,
    Her overskirt is the same silk dyed in purple,
    And when men going by look on Rafu
            They set down their burdens,
    They stand and twirl their moustaches.




Old Idea of Choan




    The narrow streets cut into the wide highway at Choan,
    Dark oxen, white horses,
            drag on the seven coaches with outriders.
    The coaches are perfumed wood,
    The jewelled chair is held up at the crossway,
    Before the royal lodge
            a glitter of golden saddles, awaiting the princess,
    They eddy before the gate of the barons.
    The canopy embroidered with dragons
            drinks in and casts back the sun.

    Evening comes.
          The trappings are bordered with mist.
    The hundred cords of mist are spread through
          and double the trees,
    Night birds, and night women,
          spread out their sounds through the gardens.




    Birds with flowery wing, hovering butterflies
            crowd over the thousand gates,
    Trees that glitter like jade,
            terraces tinged with silver,
    The seed of a myriad hues,
    A net-work of arbours and passages and covered ways,
    Double towers, winged roofs,
            border the net-work of ways:
    A place of felicitous meeting.
    Riu's house stands out on the sky,
            with glitter of colour
    As Butei of Kan had made the high golden lotus
            to gather his dews,
    Before it another house which I do not know:
    How shall we know all the friends
            whom we meet on strange roadways?




To-Em-Mei's The Unmoving Cloud

    Wet springtime, says To-em-mei,
          Wet spring in the garden.




    The clouds have gathered, and gathered,
              and the rain falls and falls,
    The eight ply of the heavens
              are all folded into one darkness,
    And the wide, flat road stretches out.
    I stop in my room toward the East, quiet, quiet,
    I pat my new cask of wine.
    My friends are estranged, or far distant,
    I bow my head and stand still.




    Rain, rain, and the clouds have gathered,
    The eight ply of the heavens are darkness,
    The flat land is turned into river.
              Wine, wine, here is wine!
    I drink by my eastern window.
    I think of talking and man,
    And no boat, no carriage, approaches.




    The trees in my east-looking garden
              are bursting out with new twigs,
    They try to stir new affection,

    And men say the sun and moon keep on moving
              because they can't find a soft seat.

    The birds flutter to rest in my tree,
              and I think I have heard them saying,
    It is not that there are no other men
    But we like this fellow the best,
    But however we long to speak
    He can not know of our sorrow.



END OF CATHAY




Near Perigord

    RIGHT


    You'd have men's hearts up from the dust
    And tell their secrets, Messire Cino,
    Right enough? Then read between the lines
                of Uc St. Cire,
    Solve me the riddle, for you know the tale.

    Bertrans, En Bertrans, left a fine canzone:
    Maent, I love you, you have turned me out.
    The voice at Montfort, Lady Agnes' hair,
    Bel Miral's stature, the vicountess' throat,
    Set all together, are not worthy of you ...
    And all the while you sing out that canzone,
    Think you that Maent lived at Montaignac,
    One at Chalais, another at Malemort
    Hard over Brive -- for every lady a castle,
    Each place strong.

                Oh, _is_ it easy enough?
    Tairiran held hall in Montaignac,
    His brother-in-law was all there was of power
    In Perigord, and this good union
    Gobbled all the land, and held it later
                for some hundreds years.
    And our En Bertrans was in Altafort,
    Hub of the wheel, the stirrer-up of strife,
    As caught by Dante in the last wallow of hell -- 
    The headless trunk that made its head a lamp.
    For separation wrought out separation,
    And he who set the strife between brother and brother
    And had his way with the old English king,
    Viced in such torture for the counterpass.

      How would you live, with neighbours set about you -- 
    Poictiers and Brive, untaken Rochechouart,
    Spread like the finger-tips of one frail hand;
    And you on that great mountain of a palm -- 
    Not a neat ledge, not Foix between its streams,
    But one huge back half-covered up with pine,
    Worked for and snatched from the string-purse of Born -- 
    The four round towers, four brothers -- mostly fools:
    What could he do but play the desperate chess,
    And stir old grudges?
                Pawn your castles, lords!
    Let the Jews pay.
                And the great scene -- 
    (That, maybe, never happened!)
                Beaten at last,
    Before the hard old king:
                Your son, ah, since he died
    My wit and worth are cobwebs brushed aside
    In the full flare of grief. Do what you will.

      Take the whole man, and ravel out the story.
    He loved this lady in castle Montaignac?
    The castle flanked him -- he had need of it.
    You read to-day, how long the overlords of Perigord,
    The Talleyrands, have held the place, it was no transient fiction.
    And Maent failed him? Or saw through the scheme?

      And all his net-like thought of new alliance?
    Chalais is high, a-level with the poplars.
    Its lowest stones just meet the valley tips
    Where the low Dronne is filled with water-lilies.
    And Rochecouart can match it, stronger yet,
    The very spur's end, built on sheerest cliff,
    And Malemort keeps its close hold on Brive,
    While Born his own close purse, his rabbit warren,
    His subterranean chamber with a dozen doors,
    A-bristle with antennae to feel roads,
    To sniff the traffic into Perigord.
    And that hard phalanx, that unbroken line,
    The ten good miles from thence to Maent's castle,
    All of his flank -- how could he do without her?
    And all the road to Cahors, to Toulouse?
    What would he do without her?

                Papiol,
    Go forthright singing -- Anhes, Cembelins.
    There is a throat; ah, there are two white hands;
    There is a trellis full of early roses,
    And all my heart is bound about with love.
    Where am I come with compound flatteries -- 
    What doors are open to fine compliment?
    And every one half jealous of Maent?
    He wrote the catch to pit their jealousies
    Against her, give her pride in them?

    Take his own speech, make what you will of it -- 
    And still the knot, the first knot, of Maent?

      Is it a love poem? Did he sing of war?
    Is it an intrigue to run subtly out,
    Born of a jongleur's tongue, freely to pass
    Up and about and in and out the land,
    Mark him a craftsman and a strategist?
    (St. Leider had done as much at Polhonac,
    Singing a different stave, as closely hidden.)
    Oh, there is precedent, legal tradition,
    To sing one thing when your song means another,

    Foix' count knew that. What is Sir Bertrans' singing?

    Maent, Maent, and yet again Maent,
    Or war and broken heaumes and politics?



      End fact. Try fiction, Let us say we see
    En Bertrans, a tower-room at Hautefort,
    Sunset, the ribbon-like road lies, in red cross-light,
    South toward Montaignac, and he bends at a table
    Scribbling, swearing between his teeth, by his left hand
    Lie little strips of parchment covered over,
    Scratched and erased with _al_ and _ochaisos_.
    Testing his list of rhymes, a lean man? Bilious?
    With a red straggling beard?
    And the green cat's-eye lifts toward Montaignac.

      Or take his magnet singer setting out,
    Dodging his way past Aubeterre, singing at Chalais

                In the vaulted hall,
    Or, by a lichened tree at Rochecouart
    Aimlessly watching a hawk above the valleys,
    Waiting his turn in the mid-summer evening,
    Thinking of Aelis, whom he loved heart and soul ...
    To find her half alone, Montfort away,
    And a brown, placid, hated woman visiting her,
    Spoiling his visit, with a year before the next one.
    Little enough?
    Or carry him forward. Go through all the courts,
    My Magnet, Bertrand had said.

                We came to Ventadour
    In the mid love court, he sings out the canzon,
    No one hears save Arrimon Luc D'Esparo -- 
    No one hears aught save the gracious sound of compliments.
    Sir Arrimon counts on his fingers, Montfort,
    Rochecouart, Chalais, the rest, the tactic,
    Malemort, guesses beneath, sends word to Coeur de Lion:

    The compact, de Born smoked out, trees felled
    About his castle, cattle driven out!
    Or no one sees it, and En Bertrans prospered?

      And ten years after, or twenty, as you will,
    Arnaut and Richard lodge beneath Chalus:
    The dull round towers encroaching on the field,
    The tents tight drawn, horses at tether
    Further and out of reach, the purple night,
    The crackling of small fires, the bannerets,
    The lazy leopards on the largest banner,
    Stray gleams on hanging mail, an armourer's torch-flare
    Melting on steel.

                And in the quietest space
    They probe old scandals, say de Born is dead;
    And we've the gossip (skipped six hundred years).
    Richard shall die to-morrow -- leave him there
    Talking of _trobar clus_ with Daniel.
    And the best craftsman sings out his friend's song,
    Envies its vigour ... and deplores the technique,
    Dispraises his own skill? -- That's as you will.
    And they discuss the dead man,
    Plantagenet puts the riddle: Did he love her?
    And Arnaut parries: Did he love your sister?
    True, he has praised her, but in some opinion
    He wrote that praise only to show he had
    The favour of your party, had been well received.

      You knew the man.
                _You_ knew the man.
    I am an artist, you have tried both m tiers.
    You were born near him.
                Do we know our friends?
    Say that he saw the castles, say that he loved Maent!
    Say that he loved her, does it solve the riddle?
      End the discussion, Richard goes out next day
    And gets a quarrel-bolt shot through his vizard,
    Pardons the bowman, dies,

                Ends our discussion. Arnaut ends
    In sacred odour -- (that's apocryphal!)
    And we can leave the talk till Dante writes:
    _Surely I saw, and still before my eyes_
    _Goes on that headless trunk, that bears for light_
    _Its own head swinging, gripped by the dead hair,_
    _And like a swinging lamp that says, Ah me!_
    _I severed men, my head and heart_
    _Ye see here severed, my life's counterpart._

    Or take En Bertrans?


    RIGHT


    Bewildering spring, and by the Auvezere
    Poppies and day's-eyes in the green  mail
    Rose over us; and we knew all that stream,
    And our two horses had traced out the valleys;
    Knew the low flooded lands squared out with poplars,
    In the young days when the deep sky befriended.
      And great wings beat above us in the twilight,
    And the great wheels in heaven
    Bore us together ... surging ... and apart ...
    Believing we should meet with lips and hands.

      High, high and sure ... and then the counter-thrust:
    `Why do you love me? Will you always love me?
    But I am like the grass, I can not love you.`
    Or, `Love, and I love and love you,
    And hate your mind, not _you_, your soul, your hands.`

      So to this last estrangement, Tairiran!

      There shut up in his castle, Tairiran's,
    She who had nor ears nor tongue save in her hands,
    Gone -- ah, gone -- untouched, unreachable!
    She who could never live save through one person,
    She who could never speak save to one person,
    And all the rest of her a shifting change,
    A broken bundle of mirrors ...!




Villanelle: the Psychological Hour


    I had over-prepared the event,
            that much was ominous.
    With middle-ageing care
            I had laid out just the right books.
    I had almost turned down the pages.

                _Beauty is so rare a thing._
                _So few drink of my fountain._

    So much barren regret,
    So many hours wasted!
    And now I watch, from the window,
            the rain, the wandering busses.

    Their little cosmos is shaken -- 
            the air is alive with that fact.
    In their parts of the city
            they are played on by diverse forces.
    How do I know?
            Oh, I know well enough.
    For them there is something afoot.

            As for me:
    I had over-prepared the event -- 

                _Beauty is so rare a thing._
                _So few drink of my fountain._

    Two friends: a breath of the forest ...
    Friends? Are people less friends
            because one has lust, at least, found them?
    Twice they promised to come.
            _Between the night and morning?_

    _Beauty would drink of my mind._
    Youth would awhile forget
            my youth is gone from me.




    (Speak up! You have danced so stiffly?
       Someone admired your works,
       And said so frankly.

       Did you talk like a fool,
       The first night?
       The second evening?

    _But_ they promised again:
            `To-morrow at tea-time.`)




    Now the third day is here -- 
            no word from either;
    No word from her nor him,
    Only another man's note:
            Dear Pound, I am leaving England.






To a Friend Writing on Cabaret Dancers

    RIGHT



    Good Hedgethorn, for we'll anglicize your name
    Until the last slut's hanged and the last pig disemboweled,
    Seeing your wife is charming and your child
    Sings in the open meadow -- at least the kodak says so -- 
    My good fellow, you, on a cabaret silence
    And the dancers, you write a sonnet,
    Say Forget To-morrow, being of all men
    The most prudent, orderly, and decorous!

    Pepita has no to-morrow, so you write.

    Pepita has such to-morrows: with the hands puffed out,
    The pug-dog's features encrusted with tallow
    Sunk in a frowsy collar -- an unbrushed black.
    She will not bathe too often, but her jewels
    Will be a stuffy, opulent sort of fungus
    Spread on both hands and on the up-pushed bosom -- 
    It juts like a shelf between the jowl and corset.

    Have you, or I seen most of cabarets, good Hedgethorn?

    Here's Pepita, tall and slim as an Egyptian mummy,
    Marsh-cranberries, the ribbed and angular pods
    Flare up with scarlet orange on stiff stalks
    And so Pepita
            flares on the crowded stage before our tables
    Or slithers about between the dishonest waiters -- 



    And 

            you know the deathless verses.
    I search the features, the avaricious features
    Pulled by the kohl and rouge out of resemblance -- 
    Six pence the object for a change of passion.

    Write me a poem.
            Come now, my dear Pepita,

            that's what you mean you advertising spade,
    Or take the intaglio, my fat great-uncle's heirloom:
    Cupid, astride a phallus with two wings,
    Swinging a cat-o'-nine-tails.
            No. Pepita,
    I have seen through the crust.
            I don't know what you look like
    But your smile pulls one way
            and your painted grin another,
    While that cropped fool,
            that tom-boy who can't earn her living.
    Come, come to-morrow,

Homage to Quintus Septimius Florentis Christianus

    This place is the Cyprian's, for she has ever the fancy
    To be looking out across the bright sea,
    Therefore the sailors are cheered, and the waves
    Keep small with reverence, beholding her image.






    A sad and great evil is the expectation of death -- 
    And there are also the inane expenses of the funeral;
    Let us therefore cease from pitying the dead
    For after death there comes no other calamity.






_Troy_

    Whither, O city, are your profits and your gilded shrines,
    And your barbecues of great oxen,
    And the tall women walking your streets, in gilt clothes,
    With their perfumes in little alabaster boxes?
    Where is the work of your home-born sculptors?

    Time's tooth is into the lot, and war's and fate's too.
    Envy has taken your all,
    Save your douth and your story.

Fish and the Shadow


    The salmon-trout drifts in the stream,
    The soul of the salmon-trout floats over the stream
                    Like a little wafer of light.

    The salmon moves in the sun-shot, bright shallow sea....

    As light as the shadow of the fish
                    that falls through the water,
    She came into the large room by the stair,
    Yawning a little she came with the sleep still upon her.

    I am just from bed. The sleep is still in my eyes.
    Come. I have had a long dream.

    And I: That wood?
    And two springs have passed us.

    Not so far, no, not so far now,
    There is a place -- but no one else knows it -- 
    A field in a valley....


    She must speak of the time
    Of Arnaut de Mareuil, I thought,

    Light as the shadow of the fish
    That falls through the pale green water.
                                   

Sea Garden



SEA ROSE


    Rose, harsh rose,
    marred and with stint of petals,
    meagre flower, thin,
    sparse of leaf,

    more precious
    than a wet rose
    single on a stem -- 
    you are caught in the drift.

    Stunted, with small leaf,
    you are flung on the sand,
    you are lifted
    in the crisp sand
    that drives in the wind.

    Can the spice-rose
    drip such acrid fragrance
    hardened in a leaf?




THE HELMSMAN


    O be swift -- 
    we have always known you wanted us.

    We fled inland with our flocks,
    we pastured them in hollows,
    cut off from the wind
    and the salt track of the marsh.

    We worshipped inland -- 
    we stepped past wood-flowers,
    we forgot your tang,
    we brushed wood-grass.

    We wandered from pine-hills
    through oak and scrub-oak tangles,
    we broke hyssop and bramble,
    we caught flower and new bramble-fruit
    in our hair: we laughed
    as each branch whipped back,
    we tore our feet in half buried rocks
    and knotted roots and acorn-cups.

    We forgot -- we worshipped,
    we parted green from green,
    we sought further thickets,
    we dipped our ankles
    through leaf-mould and earth,
    and wood and wood-bank enchanted us -- 

    and the feel of the clefts in the bark,
    and the slope between tree and tree -- 
    and a slender path strung field to field
    and wood to wood
    and hill to hill
    and the forest after it.

    We forgot -- for a moment
    tree-resin, tree-bark,
    sweat of a torn branch
    were sweet to the taste.

    We were enchanted with the fields,
    the tufts of coarse grass
    in the shorter grass -- 
    we loved all this.

    But now, our boat climbs -- hesitates -- drops -- 
    climbs -- hesitates -- crawls back -- 
    climbs -- hesitates -- 
    O be swift -- 
    we have always known you wanted us.




THE SHRINE

(SHE WATCHES OVER THE SEA)


    Are your rocks shelter for ships -- 
    have you sent galleys from your beach,
    are you graded -- a safe crescent -- 
    where the tide lifts them back to port -- 
    are you full and sweet,
    tempting the quiet
    to depart in their trading ships?

    Nay, you are great, fierce, evil -- 
    you are the land-blight -- 
    you have tempted men
    but they perished on your cliffs.

    Your lights are but dank shoals,
    slate and pebble and wet shells
    and seaweed fastened to the rocks.

    It was evil -- evil
    when they found you,
    when the quiet men looked at you -- 
    they sought a headland
    shaded with ledge of cliff
    from the wind-blast.

    But you -- you are unsheltered,
    cut with the weight of wind -- 
    you shudder when it strikes,
    then lift, swelled with the blast -- 
    you sink as the tide sinks,
    you shrill under hail, and sound
    thunder when thunder sounds.
    You are useless -- 
    when the tides swirl
    your boulders cut and wreck
    the staggering ships.




    You are useless,
    O grave, O beautiful,
    the landsmen tell it -- I have heard -- 
    you are useless.

    And the wind sounds with this
    and the sea
    where rollers shot with blue
    cut under deeper blue.

    O but stay tender, enchanted
    where wave-lengths cut you
    apart from all the rest -- 
    for we have found you,
    we watch the splendour of you,
    we thread throat on throat of freesia
    for your shelf.

    You are not forgot,
    O plunder of lilies,
    honey is not more sweet
    than the salt stretch of your beach.




    Stay -- stay -- 
    but terror has caught us now,
    we passed the men in ships,
    we dared deeper than the fisher-folk
    and you strike us with terror
    O bright shaft.

    Flame passes under us
    and sparks that unknot the flesh,
    sorrow, splitting bone from bone,
    splendour athwart our eyes
    and rifts in the splendour,
    sparks and scattered light.

    Many warned of this,
    men said:
    there are wrecks on the fore-beach,
    wind will beat your ship,
    there is no shelter in that headland,
    it is useless waste, that edge,
    that front of rock -- 
    sea-gulls clang beyond the breakers,
    none venture to that spot.




    But hail -- 
    as the tide slackens,
    as the wind beats out,
    we hail this shore -- 
    we sing to you,
    spirit between the headlands
    and the further rocks.

    Though oak-beams split,
    though boats and sea-men flounder,
    and the strait grind sand with sand
    and cut boulders to sand and drift -- 

    your eyes have pardoned our faults,
    your hands have touched us -- 
    you have leaned forward a little
    and the waves can never thrust us back
    from the splendour of your ragged coast.




MID-DAY


    The light beats upon me.
    I am startled -- 
    a split leaf crackles on the paved floor -- 
    I am anguished -- defeated.

    A slight wind shakes the seed-pods -- 
    my thoughts are spent
    as the black seeds.
    My thoughts tear me,
    I dread their fever.
    I am scattered in its whirl.
    I am scattered like
    the hot shrivelled seeds.

    The shrivelled seeds
    are spilt on the path -- 
    the grass bends with dust,
    the grape slips
    under its crackled leaf:
    yet far beyond the spent seed-pods,
    and the blackened stalks of mint,
    the poplar is bright on the hill,
    the poplar spreads out,
    deep-rooted among trees.

    O poplar, you are great
    among the hill-stones,
    while I perish on the path
    among the crevices of the rocks.




PURSUIT


    What do I care
    that the stream is trampled,
    the sand on the stream-bank
    still holds the print of your foot:
    the heel is cut deep.
    I see another mark
    on the grass ridge of the bank -- 
    it points toward the wood-path.
    I have lost the third
    in the packed earth.

    But here
    a wild-hyacinth stalk is snapped:
    the purple buds -- half ripe -- 
    show deep purple
    where your heel pressed.

    A patch of flowering grass,
    low, trailing -- 
    you brushed this:
    the green stems show yellow-green
    where you lifted -- turned the earth-side
    to the light:
    this and a dead leaf-spine,
    split across,
    show where you passed.

    You were swift, swift!
    here the forest ledge slopes -- 
    rain has furrowed the roots.
    Your hand caught at this;
    the root snapped under your weight.

    I can almost follow the note
    where it touched this slender tree
    and the next answered -- 
    and the next.

    And you climbed yet further!
    you stopped by the dwarf-cornel -- 
    whirled on your heels,
    doubled on your track.

    This is clear -- 
    you fell on the downward slope,
    you dragged a bruised thigh -- you limped -- 
    you clutched this larch.

    Did your head, bent back,
    search further -- 
    clear through the green leaf-moss
    of the larch branches?

    Did you clutch,
    stammer with short breath and gasp:
    _wood-daemons grant life -- 
    give life -- I am almost lost._

    For some wood-daemon
    has lightened your steps.
    I can find no trace of you
    in the larch-cones and the underbrush.




THE CONTEST





    Your stature is modelled
    with straight tool-edge:
    you are chiselled like rocks
    that are eaten into by the sea.

    With the turn and grasp of your wrist
    and the chords' stretch,
    there is a glint like worn brass.

    The ridge of your breast is taut,
    and under each the shadow is sharp,
    and between the clenched muscles
    of your slender hips.

    From the circle of your cropped hair
    there is light,
    and about your male torse
    and the foot-arch and the straight ankle.



    You stand rigid and mighty -- 
    granite and the ore in rocks;
    a great band clasps your forehead
    and its heavy twists of gold.

    You are white -- a limb of cypress
    bent under a weight of snow.

    You are splendid,
    your arms are fire;
    you have entered the hill-straits -- 
    a sea treads upon the hill-slopes.



    Myrtle is about your head,
    you have bent and caught the spray:
    each leaf is sharp
    against the lift and furrow
    of your bound hair.

    The narcissus has copied the arch
    of your slight breast:
    your feet are citron-flowers,
    your knees, cut from white-ash,
    your thighs are rock-cistus.

    Your chin lifts straight
    from the hollow of your curved throat.
    Your shoulders are level -- 
    they have melted rare silver
    for their breadth.




SEA LILY


    Reed,
    slashed and torn
    but doubly rich -- 
    such great heads as yours
    drift upon temple-steps,
    but you are shattered
    in the wind.

    Myrtle-bark
    is flecked from you,
    scales are dashed
    from your stem,
    sand cuts your petal,
    furrows it with hard edge,
    like flint
    on a bright stone.

    Yet though the whole wind
    slash at your bark,
    you are lifted up,
    aye -- though it hiss
    to cover you with froth.




THE WIND SLEEPERS


    Whiter
    than the crust
    left by the tide,
    we are stung by the hurled sand
    and the broken shells.

    We no longer sleep
    in the wind -- 
    we awoke and fled
    through the city gate.

    Tear -- 
    tear us an altar,
    tug at the cliff-boulders,
    pile them with the rough stones -- 
    we no longer
    sleep in the wind,
    propitiate us.

    Chant in a wail
    that never halts,
    pace a circle and pay tribute
    with a song.

    When the roar of a dropped wave
    breaks into it,
    pour meted words
    of sea-hawks and gulls
    and sea-birds that cry
    discords.




THE GIFT


    Instead of pearls -- a wrought clasp -- 
    a bracelet -- will you accept this?

    You know the script -- 
    you will start, wonder:
    what is left, what phrase
    after last night? This:

    The world is yet unspoiled for you,
    you wait, expectant -- 
    you are like the children
    who haunt your own steps
    for chance bits -- a comb
    that may have slipped,
    a gold tassel, unravelled,
    plucked from your scarf,
    twirled by your slight fingers
    into the street -- 
    a flower dropped.

    Do not think me unaware,
    I who have snatched at you
    as the street-child clutched
    at the seed-pearls you spilt
    that hot day
    when your necklace snapped.

    Do not dream that I speak
    as one defrauded of delight,
    sick, shaken by each heart-beat
    or paralyzed, stretched at length,
    who gasps:
    these ripe pears
    are bitter to the taste,
    this spiced wine, poison, corrupt.
    I cannot walk -- 
    who would walk?
    Life is a scavenger's pit -- I escape -- 
    I only, rejecting it,
    lying here on this couch.

    Your garden sloped to the beach,
    myrtle overran the paths,
    honey and amber flecked each leaf,
    the citron-lily head -- 
    one among many -- 
    weighed there, over-sweet.

    The myrrh-hyacinth
    spread across low slopes,
    violets streaked black ridges
    through the grass.

    The house, too, was like this,
    over painted, over lovely -- 
    the world is like this.

    Sleepless nights,
    I remember the initiates,
    their gesture, their calm glance.
    I have heard how in rapt thought,
    in vision, they speak
    with another race,
    more beautiful, more intense than this.
    I could laugh -- 
    more beautiful, more intense?

    Perhaps that other life
    is contrast always to this.
    I reason:
    I have lived as they
    in their inmost rites -- 
    they endure the tense nerves
    through the moment of ritual.
    I endure from moment to moment -- 
    days pass all alike,
    tortured, intense.

    This I forgot last night:
    you must not be blamed,
    it is not your fault;
    as a child, a flower -- any flower
    tore my breast -- 
    meadow-chicory, a common grass-tip,
    a leaf shadow, a flower tint
    unexpected on a winter-branch.

    I reason:
    another life holds what this lacks,
    a sea, unmoving, quiet -- 
    not forcing our strength
    to rise to it, beat on beat -- 
    stretch of sand,
    no garden beyond, strangling
    with its myrrh-lilies -- 
    a hill, not set with black violets
    but stones, stones, bare rocks,
    dwarf-trees, twisted, no beauty
    to distract -- to crowd
    madness upon madness.

    Only a still place
    and perhaps some outer horror
    some hideousness to stamp beauty,
    a mark -- no changing it now -- 
    on our hearts.

    I send no string of pearls,
    no bracelet -- accept this.




EVENING


    The light passes
    from ridge to ridge,
    from flower to flower -- 
    the hypaticas, wide-spread
    under the light
    grow faint -- 
    the petals reach inward,
    the blue tips bend
    toward the bluer heart
    and the flowers are lost.

    The cornel-buds are still white,
    but shadows dart
    from the cornel-roots -- 
    black creeps from root to root,
    each leaf
    cuts another leaf on the grass,
    shadow seeks shadow,
    then both leaf
    and leaf-shadow are lost.




SHELTERED GARDEN


    I have had enough.
    I gasp for breath.

    Every way ends, every road,
    every foot-path leads at last
    to the hill-crest -- 
    then you retrace your steps,
    or find the same slope on the other side,
    precipitate.

    I have had enough -- 
    border-pinks, clove-pinks, wax-lilies,
    herbs, sweet-cress.

    O for some sharp swish of a branch -- 
    there is no scent of resin
    in this place,
    no taste of bark, of coarse weeds,
    aromatic, astringent -- 
    only border on border of scented pinks.

    Have you seen fruit under cover
    that wanted light -- 
    pears wadded in cloth,
    protected from the frost,
    melons, almost ripe,
    smothered in straw?

    Why not let the pears cling
    to the empty branch?
    All your coaxing will only make
    a bitter fruit -- 
    let them cling, ripen of themselves,
    test their own worth,
    nipped, shrivelled by the frost,
    to fall at last but fair
    with a russet coat.

    Or the melon -- 
    let it bleach yellow
    in the winter light,
    even tart to the taste -- 
    it is better to taste of frost -- 
    the exquisite frost -- 
    than of wadding and of dead grass.

    For this beauty,
    beauty without strength,
    chokes out life.
    I want wind to break,
    scatter these pink-stalks,
    snap off their spiced heads,
    fling them about with dead leaves -- 
    spread the paths with twigs,
    limbs broken off,
    trail great pine branches,
    hurled from some far wood
    right across the melon-patch,
    break pear and quince -- 
    leave half-trees, torn, twisted
    but showing the fight was valiant.

    O to blot out this garden
    to forget, to find a new beauty
    in some terrible
    wind-tortured place.




SEA POPPIES


    Amber husk
    fluted with gold,
    fruit on the sand
    marked with a rich grain,

    treasure
    spilled near the shrub-pines
    to bleach on the boulders:

    your stalk has caught root
    among wet pebbles
    and drift flung by the sea
    and grated shells
    and split conch-shells.

    Beautiful, wide-spread,
    fire upon leaf,
    what meadow yields
    so fragrant a leaf
    as your bright leaf?




LOSS


    The sea called -- 
    you faced the estuary,
    you were drowned as the tide passed. -- 
    I am glad of this -- 
    at least you have escaped.

    The heavy sea-mist stifles me.
    I choke with each breath -- 
    a curious peril, this -- 
    the gods have invented
    curious torture for us.

    One of us, pierced in the flank,
    dragged himself across the marsh,
    he tore at the bay-roots,
    lost hold on the crumbling bank -- 

    Another crawled -- too late -- 
    for shelter under the cliffs.

    I am glad the tide swept you out,
    O beloved,
    you of all this ghastly host
    alone untouched,
    your white flesh covered with salt
    as with myrrh and burnt iris.

    We were hemmed in this place,
    so few of us, so few of us to fight
    their sure lances,
    the straight thrust -- effortless
    with slight life of muscle and shoulder.

    So straight -- only we were left,
    the four of us -- somehow shut off.

    And the marsh dragged one back,
    and another perished under the cliff,
    and the tide swept you out.

    Your feet cut steel on the paths,
    I followed for the strength
    of life and grasp.
    I have seen beautiful feet
    but never beauty welded with strength.
    I marvelled at your height.

    You stood almost level
    with the lance-bearers
    and so slight.

    And I wondered as you clasped
    your shoulder-strap
    at the strength of your wrist
    and the turn of your young fingers,
    and the lift of your shorn locks,
    and the bronze
    of your sun-burnt neck.

    All of this,
    and the curious knee-cap,
    fitted above the wrought greaves,
    and the sharp muscles of your back
    which the tunic could not cover -- 
    the outline
    no garment could deface.

    I wonder if you knew how I watched,
    how I crowded before the spearsmen -- 
    but the gods wanted you,
    the gods wanted you back.




HUNTRESS


    Come, blunt your spear with us,
    our pace is hot
    and our bare heels
    in the heel-prints -- 
    we stand tense -- do you see -- 
    are you already beaten
    by the chase?

    We lead the pace
    for the wind on the hills,
    the low hill is spattered
    with loose earth -- 
    our feet cut into the crust
    as with spears.

    We climbed the ploughed land,
    dragged the seed from the clefts,
    broke the clods with our heels,
    whirled with a parched cry
    into the woods:

    _Can you come,
    can you come,
    can you follow the hound trail,
    can you trample the hot froth?_

    Spring up -- sway forward -- 
    follow the quickest one,
    aye, though you leave the trail
    and drop exhausted at our feet.




GARDEN


    You are clear
    O rose, cut in rock,
    hard as the descent of hail.

    I could scrape the colour
    from the petals
    like spilt dye from a rock.

    If I could break you
    I could break a tree.

    If I could stir
    I could break a tree -- 
    I could break you.



    O wind, rend open the heat,
    cut apart the heat,
    rend it to tatters.

    Fruit cannot drop
    through this thick air -- 
    fruit cannot fall into heat
    that presses up and blunts
    the points of pears
    and rounds the grapes.

    Cut the heat -- 
    plough through it,
    turning it on either side
    of your path.




SEA VIOLET


    The white violet
    is scented on its stalk,
    the sea-violet
    fragile as agate,
    lies fronting all the wind
    among the torn shells
    on the sand-bank.

    The greater blue violets
    flutter on the hill,
    but who would change for these
    who would change for these
    one root of the white sort?

    Violet
    your grasp is frail
    on the edge of the sand-hill,
    but you catch the light -- 
    frost, a star edges with its fire.




THE CLIFF TEMPLE


    Great, bright portal,
    shelf of rock,
    rocks fitted in long ledges,
    rocks fitted to dark, to silver granite,
    to lighter rock -- 
    clean cut, white against white.

    High -- high -- and no hill-goat
    tramples -- no mountain-sheep
    has set foot on your fine grass;
    you lift, you are the world-edge,
    pillar for the sky-arch.

    The world heaved -- 
    we are next to the sky:
    over us, sea-hawks shout,
    gulls sweep past -- 
    the terrible breakers are silent
    from this place.

    Below us, on the rock-edge,
    where earth is caught in the fissures
    of the jagged cliff,
    a small tree stiffens in the gale,
    it bends -- but its white flowers
    are fragrant at this height.

    And under and under,
    the wind booms:
    it whistles, it thunders,
    it growls -- it presses the grass
    beneath its great feet.


    I said:
    for ever and for ever, must I follow you
    through the stones?
    I catch at you -- you lurch:
    you are quicker than my hand-grasp.

    I wondered at you.
    I shouted -- dear -- mysterious -- beautiful -- 
    white myrtle-flesh.

    I was splintered and torn:
    the hill-path mounted
    swifter than my feet.

    Could a daemon avenge this hurt,
    I would cry to him -- could a ghost,
    I would shout -- O evil,
    follow this god,
    taunt him with his evil and his vice.



    Shall I hurl myself from here,
    shall I leap and be nearer you?
    Shall I drop, beloved, beloved,
    ankle against ankle?
    Would you pity me, O white breast?

    If I woke, would you pity me,
    would our eyes meet?

    Have you heard,
    do you know how I climbed this rock?
    My breath caught, I lurched forward -- 
    stumbled in the ground-myrtle.

    Have you heard, O god seated on the cliff,
    how far toward the ledges of your house,
    how far I had to walk?




    Over me the wind swirls.
    I have stood on your portal
    and I know -- 
    you are further than this,
    still further on another cliff.




ORCHARD


    I saw the first pear
    as it fell -- 
    the honey-seeking, golden-banded,
    the yellow swarm
    was not more fleet than I,
    (spare us from loveliness)
    and I fell prostrate
    crying:
    you have flayed us
    with your blossoms,
    spare us the beauty
    of fruit-trees.

    The honey-seeking
    paused not,
    the air thundered their song,
    and I alone was prostrate.

    O rough-hewn
    god of the orchard,
    I bring you an offering -- 
    do you, alone unbeautiful,
    son of the god,
    spare us from loveliness:

    these fallen hazel-nuts,
    stripped late of their green sheaths,
    grapes, red-purple,
    their berries
    dripping with wine,
    pomegranates already broken,
    and shrunken figs
    and quinces untouched,
    I bring you as offering.




SEA GODS




    They say there is no hope -- 
    sand -- drift -- rocks -- rubble of the sea -- 
    the broken hulk of a ship,
    hung with shreds of rope,
    pallid under the cracked pitch.

    They say there is no hope
    to conjure you -- 
    no whip of the tongue to anger you -- 
    no hate of words
    you must rise to refute.

    They say you are twisted by the sea,
    you are cut apart
    by wave-break upon wave-break,
    that you are misshapen by the sharp rocks,
    broken by the rasp and after-rasp.

    That you are cut, torn, mangled,
    torn by the stress and beat,
    no stronger than the strips of sand
    along your ragged beach.




    But we bring violets,
    great masses -- single, sweet,
    wood-violets, stream-violets,
    violets from a wet marsh.

    Violets in clumps from hills,
    tufts with earth at the roots,
    violets tugged from rocks,
    blue violets, moss, cliff, river-violets.

    Yellow violets' gold,
    burnt with a rare tint -- 
    violets like red ash
    among tufts of grass.

    We bring deep-purple
    bird-foot violets.

    We bring the hyacinth-violet,
    sweet, bare, chill to the touch -- 
    and violets whiter than the in-rush
    of your own white surf.




    For you will come,
    you will yet haunt men in ships,
    you will trail across the fringe of strait
    and circle the jagged rocks.

    You will trail across the rocks
    and wash them with your salt,
    you will curl between sand-hills -- 
    you will thunder along the cliff -- 
    break -- retreat -- get fresh strength -- 
    gather and pour weight upon the beach.

    You will draw back,
    and the ripple on the sand-shelf
    will be witness of your track.
    O privet-white, you will paint
    the lintel of wet sand with froth.

    You will bring myrrh-bark
    and drift laurel-wood from hot coasts!
    when you hurl high -- high -- 
    we will answer with a shout.

    For you will come,
    you will come,
    you will answer our taut hearts,
    you will break the lie of men's thoughts,
    and cherish and shelter us.




ACON




    Bear me to Dictaeus,
    and to the steep slopes;
    to the river Erymanthus.

    I choose spray of dittany,
    cyperum, frail of flower,
    buds of myrrh,
    all-healing herbs,
    close pressed in calathes.

    For she lies panting,
    drawing sharp breath,
    broken with harsh sobs,
    she, Hyella,
    whom no god pities.




    Dryads
    haunting the groves,
    nereids
    who dwell in wet caves,
    for all the white leaves of olive-branch,
    and early roses,
    and ivy wreaths, woven gold berries,
    which she once brought to your altars,
    bear now ripe fruits from Arcadia,
    and Assyrian wine
    to shatter her fever.

    The light of her face falls from its flower,
    as a hyacinth,
    hidden in a far valley,
    perishes upon burnt grass.

    Pales,
    bring gifts,
    bring your Phoenician stuffs,
    and do you, fleet-footed nymphs,
    bring offerings,
    Illyrian iris,
    and a branch of shrub,
    and frail-headed poppies.




NIGHT


    The night has cut
    each from each
    and curled the petals
    back from the stalk
    and under it in crisp rows;

    under at an unfaltering pace,
    under till the rinds break,
    back till each bent leaf
    is parted from its stalk;

    under at a grave pace,
    under till the leaves
    are bent back
    till they drop upon earth,
    back till they are all broken.

    O night,
    you take the petals
    of the roses in your hand,
    but leave the stark core
    of the rose
    to perish on the branch.




PRISONERS


    It is strange that I should want
    this sight of your face -- 
    we have had so much:
    at any moment now I may pass,
    stand near the gate,
    do not speak -- 
    only reach if you can, your face
    half-fronting the passage
    toward the light.

    Fate -- God sends this as a mark,
    a last token that we are not forgot,
    lost in this turmoil,
    about to be crushed out,
    burned or stamped out
    at best with sudden death.

    The spearsman who brings this
    will ask for the gold clasp
    you wear under your coat.
    I gave all I had left.

    Press close to the portal,
    my gate will soon clang
    and your fellow wretches
    will crowd to the entrance -- 
    be first at the gate.

    Ah beloved, do not speak.
    I write this in great haste -- 
    do not speak,
    you may yet be released.
    I am glad enough to depart
    though I have never tasted life
    as in these last weeks.

    It is a strange life,
    patterned in fire and letters
    on the prison pavement.
    If I glance up
    it is written on the walls,
    it is cut on the floor,
    it is patterned across
    the slope of the roof.

    I am weak -- weak -- 
    last night if the guard
    had left the gate unlocked
    I could not have ventured to escape,
    but one thought serves me now
    with strength.

    As I pass down the corridor
    past desperate faces at each cell,
    your eyes and my eyes may meet.

    You will be dark, unkempt,
    but I pray for one glimpse of your face -- 
    why do I want this?
    I who have seen you at the banquet
    each flower of your hyacinth-circlet
    white against your hair.

    Why do I want this,
    when even last night
    you startled me from sleep?
    You stood against the dark rock,
    you grasped an elder staff.

    So many nights
    you have distracted me from terror.
    Once you lifted a spear-flower.
    I remember how you stooped
    to gather it -- 
    and it flamed, the leaf and shoot
    and the threads, yellow, yellow -- 
    sheer till they burnt
    to red-purple in the cup.

    As I pass your cell-door
    do not speak.
    I was first on the list -- 
    They may forget you tried to shield me
    as the horsemen passed.




STORM


    You crash over the trees,
    you crack the live branch -- 
    the branch is white,
    the green crushed,
    each leaf is rent like split wood.

    You burden the trees
    with black drops,
    you swirl and crash -- 
    you have broken off a weighted leaf
    in the wind,
    it is hurled out,
    whirls up and sinks,
    a green stone.




SEA IRIS



    Weed, moss-weed,
    root tangled in sand,
    sea-iris, brittle flower,
    one petal like a shell
    is broken,
    and you print a shadow
    like a thin twig.

    Fortunate one,
    scented and stinging,
    rigid myrrh-bud,
    camphor-flower,
    sweet and salt -- you are wind
    in our nostrils.




    Do the murex-fishers
    drench you as they pass?
    Do your roots drag up colour
    from the sand?
    Have they slipped gold under you -- 
    rivets of gold?

    Band of iris-flowers
    above the waves,
    you are painted blue,
    painted like a fresh prow
    stained among the salt weeds.




HERMES OF THE WAYS


    The hard sand breaks,
    and the grains of it
    are clear as wine.

    Far off over the leagues of it,
    the wind,
    playing on the wide shore,
    piles little ridges,
    and the great waves
    break over it.

    But more than the many-foamed ways
    of the sea,
    I know him
    of the triple path-ways,
    Hermes,
    who awaits.

    Dubious,
    facing three ways,
    welcoming wayfarers,
    he whom the sea-orchard
    shelters from the west,
    from the east
    weathers sea-wind;
    fronts the great dunes.

    Wind rushes
    over the dunes,
    and the coarse, salt-crusted grass
    answers.

    Heu,
    it whips round my ankles!




    Small is
    this white stream,
    flowing below ground
    from the poplar-shaded hill,
    but the water is sweet.

    Apples on the small trees
    are hard,
    too small,
    too late ripened
    by a desperate sun
    that struggles through sea-mist.

    The boughs of the trees
    are twisted
    by many bafflings;
    twisted are
    the small-leafed boughs.

    But the shadow of them
    is not the shadow of the mast head
    nor of the torn sails.

    Hermes, Hermes,
    the great sea foamed,
    gnashed its teeth about me;
    but you have waited,
    were sea-grass tangles with
    shore-grass.




PEAR TREE


    Silver dust
    lifted from the earth,
    higher than my arms reach,
    you have mounted,
    O silver,
    higher than my arms reach
    you front us with great mass;

    no flower ever opened
    so staunch a white leaf,
    no flower ever parted silver
    from such rare silver;

    O white pear,
    your flower-tufts
    thick on the branch
    bring summer and ripe fruits
    in their purple hearts.




CITIES


    Can we believe -- by an effort
    comfort our hearts:
    it is not waste all this,
    not placed here in disgust,
    street after street,
    each patterned alike,
    no grace to lighten
    a single house of the hundred
    crowded into one garden-space.

    Crowded -- can we believe,
    not in utter disgust,
    in ironical play -- 
    but the maker of cities grew faint
    with the beauty of temple
    and space before temple,
    arch upon perfect arch,
    of pillars and corridors that led out
    to strange court-yards and porches
    where sun-light stamped
    hyacinth-shadows
    black on the pavement.

    That the maker of cities grew faint
    with the splendour of palaces,
    paused while the incense-flowers
    from the incense-trees
    dropped on the marble-walk,
    thought anew, fashioned this -- 
    street after street alike.

    For alas,
    he had crowded the city so full
    that men could not grasp beauty,
    beauty was over them,
    through them, about them,
    no crevice unpacked with the honey,
    rare, measureless.

    So he built a new city,
    ah can we believe, not ironically
    but for new splendour
    constructed new people
    to lift through slow growth
    to a beauty unrivalled yet -- 
    and created new cells,
    hideous first, hideous now -- 
    spread larve across them,
    not honey but seething life.

    And in these dark cells,
    packed street after street,
    souls live, hideous yet -- 
    O disfigured, defaced,
    with no trace of the beauty
    men once held so light.

    Can we think a few old cells
    were left -- we are left -- 
    grains of honey,
    old dust of stray pollen
    dull on our torn wings,
    we are left to recall the old streets?

    Is our task the less sweet
    that the larve still sleep in their cells?
    Or crawl out to attack our frail strength:
    You are useless. We live.
    We await great events.
    We are spread through this earth.
    We protect our strong race.
    You are useless.
    Your cell takes the place
    of our young future strength.

    Though they sleep or wake to torment
    and wish to displace our old cells -- 
    thin rare gold -- 
    that their larve grow fat -- 
    is our task the less sweet?

    Though we wander about,
    find no honey of flowers in this waste,
    is our task the less sweet -- 
    who recall the old splendour,
    await the new beauty of cities?




    _The city is peopled
    with spirits, not ghosts, O my love:_

    _Though they crowded between
    and usurped the kiss of my mouth
    their breath was your gift,
    their beauty, your life._

Goblins and Pagodas

  THE GHOSTS OF AN OLD HOUSE



  PROLOGUE


  The house that I write of, faces the north:
  No sun ever seeks
  Its six white columns,
  The nine great windows of its face.

  It fronts foursquare the winds.

  Under the penthouse of the veranda roof,
  The upper northern rooms
  Gloom outwards mournfully.

  Staring Ionic capitals
  Peer in them:
  Owl-like faces.

  On winter nights
  The wind, sidling round the corner,
  Shoots upwards
  With laughter.

  The windows rattle as if some one were in them wishing to get out
  And ride upon the wind.

  Doors lead to nowhere:
  Squirrels burrow between the walls.
  Closets in every room hang open,
  Windows are stared into by uncivil ancient trees.

  In the middle of the upper hallway
  There is a great circular hole
  Going up to the attic.
  A wooden lid covers it.

  All over the house there is a sense of futility;
  Of minutes dragging slowly
  And repeating
  Some worn-out story of broken effort and desire.


THE HOUSE



  BEDROOM


  The clump of jessamine
  Softly beneath the rain
  Rocks its golden flowers.

  In this room my father died:
  His bed is in the corner.
  No one has slept in it
  Since the morning when he wakened
  To meet death's hands at his heart.
  I cannot go to this room,
  Without feeling something big and angry
  Waiting for me
  To throw me on the bed,
  And press its thumbs in my throat.

  The clump of jessamine
  Without, beneath the rain,
  Rocks its golden flowers.



  LIBRARY


  Stuffy smell of mouldering leather,
  Tattered arm-chairs, creaking doors,
  Books that slovenly elbow each other,
  Sown with children's scrawls and long
  Worn out by contact with generations:
  Tattered tramps displaying yourselves -- 
  We, though you broke our backs, did not complain.
  If I had my way,
  I would take you out and bury you quickly,
  Or give you to the clean fire.



  INDIAN SKULL


  Some one dug this up and brought it
  To our house.
  In the dark upper hall, I see it dimly,
  Looking at me through the glass.

  Where dancers have danced, and weary people
  Have crept to their bedrooms in the morning,
  Where sick people have tossed all night,
  Where children have been born,
  Where feet have gone up and down,
  Where anger has blazed forth, and strange looks have passed,
  It has rested, watching meanwhile
  The opening and shutting of doors,
  The coming and going of people,
  The carrying out of coffins.

  Earth still clings to its eye-sockets,
  It will wait, till its vengeance is accomplished.



  OLD NURSERY


  In the tired face of the mirror
  There is a blue curtain reflected.
  If I could lift the reflection,
  Peer a little beyond, I would see
  A boy crying
  Because his sister is ill in another room
  And he has no one to play with:
  A boy listlessly scattering building blocks,
  And crying,
  Because no one will build for him the palace of Fairy Morgana.
  I cannot lift the curtain:
  It is stiff and frozen.



  THE BACK STAIRS


  In the afternoon
  When no one is in the house,
  I suddenly hear dull dragging feet
  Go fumbling down those dark back stairs,
  That climb up twisting,
  As if they wanted no one to see them.
  Beating a dirge upon the bare planks
  I hear those feet and the creak of a long-locked door.

  My mother often went
  Up and down those selfsame stairs,
  From the room where by the window
  She would sit all day and listlessly
  Look on the world that had destroyed her,
  She would go down in the evening
  To the room where she would sleep,
  Or rather, not sleep, but all night
  Lie staring fiercely at the ceiling.

  In the afternoon
  When no one is in the house:
  I suddenly hear dull dragging feet
  Beating out their futile tune,
  Up and down those dark back stairs,
  But there is no one in the shadows.



  THE WALL CABINET


  Above the steep back stairs
  So high that only a ladder can come to it,
  There is a wall cabinet hidden away.

  No one ever unlocks it;
  The key is lost, the door is barred,
  It is shut and still.

  Some say, a previous tenant
  Filled its shelves with rows of bottles,
  Bottles of spirit, filled with spiders.

  I do not know.
  Above the sleepy still back stairs,
  It watches, shut and still.



  THE CELLAR


  Faintly lit by a high-barred grating,
  The low-hung cellar,
  Flattens itself under the house.

  In one corner
  There is a little door,
  So low, it can scarcely be seen.

  Beyond,
  There is a narrow room,
  One must feel for the walls in the dark.

  One shrinks to go
  To the end of it,
  Feeling the smooth cold wall.

  Why did the builders who made this house,
  Stow one room away like this?



  THE FRONT DOOR


  It was always the place where our farewells were taken,
  When we travelled to the north.

  I remember there was one who made some journey,
  But did not come back.
  Many years they waited for him,
  At last the one who wished the most to see him,
  Was carried out of this selfsame door in death.

  Since then all our family partings
  Have been at another door.



THE ATTIC



  IN THE ATTIC


  Dust hangs clogged so thick
  The air has a dusty taste:
  Spider threads cling to my face,
  From the broad pine-beams.
  There is nothing living here,
  The house below might be quite empty,
  No sound comes from it.
  The old broken trunks and boxes,
  Cracked and dusty pictures,
  Legless chairs and shattered tables,
  Seem to be crying
  Softly in the stillness
  Because no one has brushed them.
  No one has any use for them, now,
  Yet I often wonder
  If these things are really dead:
  If the old trunks never open
  Letting out grey flapping things at twilight?
  If it is all as safe and dull
  As it seems?

  Why then is the stair so steep,
  Why is the doorway always locked,
  Why does nobody ever come?



  THE CALENDAR IN THE ATTIC


  I wonder how long it has been
  Since this old calendar hung here,
  With my birthday date upon it,
  Nothing else -- not a word of writing -- 
  Not a mark of any hand.

  Perhaps it was my father
  Who left it thus
  For me to see.

  Perhaps my mother
  Smiled as she saw it;
  But in later years did not smile.
  If I could tear it down,
  From the wall
  Somehow
  I would be content.
  But I am afraid, as a little child, to touch it.



  THE HOOPSKIRT


  In the night when all are sleeping,
  Up here a tiny old dame comes tripping,
  Looking for her lost hoopskirt.

  My great-grandaunt -- I never saw her -- 
  Her ghost doesn't know me from another,
  She stalks up the attic stairs angrily.

  The dust sets her sneezing and coughing,
  By the trunk she is limping and hopping,
  But alas -- the trunk is locked.

  What's an old dame to do, anyway!
  Must stay in a mouldy grave day on day,
  Or go to heaven out of style.

  In the night when all are snoring,
  The old lady makes a dreadful clatter,
  Going down the attic stairs.

  What was that? A ghost or a burglar?
  Oh, it was only the wind in the chimney,
  Yes, and the attic door that slammed.



  THE LITTLE CHAIR


  I know not why, when I saw the little chair,
  I suddenly desired to sit in it.

  I know not why, when I sat in the little chair,
  Everything changed, and life came back to me.

  I am convinced no one at all has grown up in the house,
  The break that I dreamed, itself was a dream and is broken.

  I will sit in the little chair and wait,
  Till the others come looking after me.

  And if it is after nightfall they will come,
  So much the better.

  For the little chair holds me as tightly as death;
  And rocking in it, I can hear it whisper strange things.



  IN THE DARK CORNER


  I brush the dust from this old portrait:
  Yes, it is the same face, exactly,
  Why does it look at me still with such a look of hate?

  I brush the dust from a heap of magazines:
  Here there is all what you have written,
  All that you struggled long years and went down to darkness for.

  O God, to think what I am writing
  Will be ever as this!

  O God, to think that my own face
  May some day glare from this dust!



  THE TOY CABINET


  By the old toy cabinet,
  I stand and turn over dusty things:
  Chessmen -- card games -- hoops and balls -- 
  Toy rifles, helmets, swords,
  In the far corner
  A doll's tea-set in a box.

  Where are you, golden child,
  Who gave tea to your dolls and me?
  The golden child is growing old,
  Further than Rome or Babylon
  From you have passed those foolish years.
  She lives -- she suffers -- she forgets.

  By the old toy cabinet,
  I idly stand and awkwardly
  Finger the lock of the tea-set box.
  What matter -- why should I look inside,
  Perhaps it is empty after all!
  Leave old things to the ghosts of old;

  My stupid brain refuses thought,
  I am maddened with a desire to weep.



  THE YARDSTICK


  Yardstick that measured out so many miles of cloth,
  Yardstick that covered me,
  I wonder do you hop of nights
  Out to the still hill-cemetery,
  And up and down go measuring
  A clayey grave for me?

THE LAWN



  THE THREE OAKS


  There are three ancient oaks,
  That grow near to each other.

  They lift their branches
  High as beckoning
  With outstretched arms,
  For some one to come and stand
  Under the canopy of their leaves.

  Once long ago I remember
  As I lay in the very centre,
  Between them:
  A rotten branch suddenly fell
  Near to me.

  I will not go back to those oaks:
  Their branches are too black for my liking.



  AN OAK


  Hoar mistletoe
  Hangs in clumps
  To the twisted boughs
  Of this lonely tree.

  Beneath its roots I often thought treasure was buried:
  For the roots had enclosed a circle.

  But when I dug beneath them,
  I could only find great black ants
  That attacked my hands.

  When at night I have the nightmare,
  I always see the eyes of ants
  Swarming from a mouldering box of gold.



  ANOTHER OAK


  Poison ivy crawls at its root,
  I dare not approach it,
  It has an air of hate.

  One would say a man had been hanged to its branches,
  It holds them in such a way.

  The moon gets tangled in it,
  A distant steeple seems to bark
  From its belfry to the sky.

  Something that no one ever loved,
  Is buried here:
  Some grey shape of deadly hate,
  Crawls on the back fence just beyond.

  Now I remember -- once I went
  Out by night too near this oak,
  And a red cat suddenly leapt
  From the dark and clawed my face.


  THE OLD BARN


  Owls flap in this ancient barn
  With rotted doors.

  Rats squeak in this ancient barn
  Over the floors.

  Owls flap warily every night,
  Rats' eyes gleam in the cold moonlight.

  There is something hidden in this barn,
  With barred doors.

  Something the owls have torn,
  And the rats scurry with over the floors.



  THE WELL


  The well is not used now,
  Its waters are tainted.

  I remember there was once a man went down
  To clean it.
  He found it very cold and deep,
  With a queer niche in one of its sides,
  From which he hauled forth buckets of bricks and dirt.



  THE TREES


  When the moonlight strikes the tree-tops,
  The trees are not the same.

  I know they are not the same,
  Because there is one tree that is missing,
  And it stood so long by another,
  That the other, feeling lonely,
  Now is slowly dying too.

  When the moonlight strikes the tree-tops
  That dead tree comes back;
  Like a great blue sphere of smoke
  Half buoyed, half ravelling on the grass,
  Rustling through frayed Branches,
  Something eerily cheeping through it,
  Something creeping through its shade.



  VISION


  You who flutter and quiver
  An instant
  Just beyond my apprehension;
  Lady,
  I will find the white orchid for you,
  If you will but give me
  One smile between those wayward drifts of hair.

  I will break the wild berries that loop themselves over the marsh-pool,
  For your sake,
  And the long green canes that swish against each other,
  I will break, to set in your hands.
  For there is no wonder like to you,
  You who flutter and quiver
  An instant
  Just beyond my apprehension.



  EPILOGUE


  Why it was I do not know,
  But last night I vividly dreamed
  Though a thousand miles away,
  That I had come back to you.

  The windows were the same:
  The bed, the furniture the same,
  Only there was a door where empty wall had always been,
  And someone was trying to enter it.

  I heard the grate of a key,
  An unknown voice apologetically
  Excused its intrusion just as I awoke.

  But I wonder after all
  If there was some secret entranceway,
  Some ghost I overlooked, when I was there.



  SYMPHONIES




  BLUE SYMPHONY



  The darkness rolls upward.
  The thick darkness carries with it
  Rain and a ravel of cloud.
  The sun comes forth upon earth.

  Palely the dawn
  Leaves me facing timidly
  Old gardens sunken:
  And in the gardens is water.

  Sombre wreck -- autumnal leaves;
  Shadowy roofs
  In the blue mist,
  And a willow-branch that is broken.

  Oh, old pagodas of my soul, how you glittered across green trees!

  Blue and cool:
  Blue, tremulously,
  Blow faint puffs of smoke
  Across sombre pools.
  The damp green smell of rotted wood;
  And a heron that cries from out the water.




  Through the upland meadows
  I go alone.
  For I dreamed of someone last night
  Who is waiting for me.

  Flower and blossom, tell me, do you know of her?

  Have the rocks hidden her voice?
  They are very blue and still.

  Long upward road that is leading me,
  Light hearted I quit you,
  For the long loose ripples of the meadow-grass
  Invite me to dance upon them.

  Quivering grass
  Daintily poised
  For her foot's tripping.

  Oh, blown clouds, could I only race up like you,
  Oh, the last slopes that are sun-drenched and steep!

  Look, the sky!
  Across black valleys
  Rise blue-white aloft
  Jagged unwrinkled mountains, ranges of death.

  Solitude. Silence.





  One chuckles by the brook for me:
  One rages under the stone.
  One makes a spout of his mouth
  One whispers -- one is gone.

  One over there on the water
  Spreads cold ripples
  For me
  Enticingly.

  The vast dark trees
  Flow like blue veils
  Of tears
  Into the water.

  Sour sprites,
  Moaning and chuckling,
  What have you hidden from me?

  In the palace of the blue stone she lies forever
  Bound hand and foot.

  Was it the wind
  That rattled the reeds together?

  Dry reeds,
  A faint shiver in the grasses.




  On the left hand there is a temple:
  And a palace on the right-hand side.
  Foot passengers in scarlet
  Pass over the glittering tide.

  Under the bridge
  The old river flows
  Low and monotonous
  Day after day.

  I have heard and have seen
  All the news that has been:
  Autumn's gold and Spring's green!

  Now in my palace
  I see foot passengers
  Crossing the river:
  Pilgrims of autumn
  In the afternoons.

  Lotus pools:
  Petals in the water.
  These are my dreams.

  For me silks are outspread.
  I take my ease, unthinking.




  And now the lowest pine-branch
  Is drawn across the disk of the sun.
  Old friends who will forget me soon,
  I must go on,
  Towards those blue death-mountains
  I have forgot so long.

  In the marsh grasses
  There lies forever
  My last treasure,
  With the hopes of my heart.

  The ice is glazing over,
  Tom lanterns flutter,
  On the leaves is snow.

  In the frosty evening.
  Toll the old bell for me
  Once, in the sleepy temple.

  Perhaps my soul will hear.

  Afterglow:
  Before the stars peep
  I shall creep out into darkness.




  SOLITUDE IN THE CITY

  (_Symphony in Black and Gold_)


  WORDS AT MIDNIGHT


  Because the night is so still,
  Because there is no one about,
  Not the tiny squeak of a mouse over the carpet,
  Nor the slow beat of a clock at the top of the stairway,
  I am afraid of the night that is coming to me.

  I know out there
  Some one is thinking of me, some one is wondering about me,
  Some one is needing me, some one is dying for my sake,
  Yet I remain alone.

  I know that life is calling: I cannot resist it:
  Too much of myself I have given ever to turn away,
  I know that shame, sickness, death itself shall befall me,
  And I am afraid.

  O night, hide me in your long cold arms:
  Let me sleep, but let me not live this life!
  There are too many people with haggard eyes standing
  before me
  Saying, To live you must suffer even as we.

  Yet life bitterly bids me: Go on to the last,
  No matter the mud and the cold rain and the darkness:
  No matter the drear pilgrims in whose eyes you shall look for long,
  And see all suffering, madness, death and despair.

  Because my heart is cramped in,
  Because I have suffered much,
  Because my hope is like a candle-flame quenched at midnight,
  Because I dare dream yet of joy,
  I can take my night and the life that is coming to me.





  THE EVENING RAIN


  O the rain of the evening is an infinite thing,
  As it slowly slips on the motionless pavement;
  Greasy and grey is the rain of the evening,
  As it dribbles into the dirty gutters
  And slides down the drains with a roar!

  Ragged men cower
  Under the doorways:
  Umbrellas nod like drowsy birds.
  Bat-umbrellas,
  Teetering, balancing,
  Where will you spread your wings to-night?

  Tangled between the factory-chimneys,
  I have seen the golden lamps wake this evening:
  Spinning and whirling, darting and dancing,
  Tangled with the glittering rain.

  Omnibuses lurch
  Heavily homeward
  Elephants tinselled in tawdry gold:
  Taxicabs fight
  Like wild birds squalling,
  Wild birds with roaring, clattering wings.

  O the rain of the evening is an infinite thing,
  As it shivers to jewel-heaps spilt on the pavement.
  The facades frown gloomily at its beauty,
  The facades are dreaming of the day.

  With rippling, curling,
  Serpentine convolutions
  The pavements drip with drunken light.
  Crimson and gold,
  Shot with opal,
  They glare against the sullen night.

  O the rain of the evening is an infinite thing
  As it slowly dries on the dirty pavement.
  Red low-browed clouds jut over the sky:
  And in the cool sky there are stars.



  STREET OF SORROWS


  You street of sorrows bending
  Over your golden lamps in the evening;
  Dark street that is very silent,
  And everywhere the same:
  Elsewhere there is song and riot,
  Like golden fireflies flickering,
  Elsewhere the crane's gaunt muscles
  Tug the city up to the stars.

  But who in the dawn should come near you?
  There are dry leaves rattling behind him.
  And who should come in the noonday?
  There are shadows that squat on the pave.
  And who should come in the evening?
  There is one: a ship in dark waters.
  And who should come at nightfall,
  To feel cold hands at his heart?

  You street of solitude waiting
  Patient and still in the evening:
  Old street that is very weary,
  And everywhere the same;
  You that have seen joy passing.
  Into pain, into tears, into darkness,
  Street of the dead and musty,
  I have drunk your cold poison to-night.


  SONG IN THE DARKNESS


  It is the last night that I can be solitary:
  Henceforth the keys and wards of me are held in other hands.

  Dark clouds trail over the sky:
  Troops of song retreating:
  But in the sunset
  Once more have I seen aloft
  Incredible summits of gold, far on the south horizon.

  One purple veil of rain
  Floats downward over the city;
  And as it settles slowly
  The light goes out of it.

  Chimneys with massive summits
  Stand gaunt and black and evil:
  Like a river of lead, to seaward
  The river steadily rolls.

  It is the last night that I can be solitary:
  Life takes me in black coils.

  One green light glitters:
  Then a swift taxi
  Scatters another
  As it speeds on.

  The chimneys rank
  Their motionless forces
  Against the swift movement
  Of tugs in the stream;
  Against the flame-chariots
  Of the Embankment;
  Against the bowing trees,
  Against the blowing smoke,
  Against the busy rain.

  With dying might
  The light invades
  The city's hall:
  Curtained by dripping fringes
  Of buoyant tattered cloud,
  Tossed by the wind.

  It is the last night that I can be solitary;
  And all my city of dreams is burning up to-night.

  But yet there waits for me something lost back in the darkness:
  Something I have never seized: a shape, a voice, a gesture,
  Something behind my shoulder: grey robes that stir and rustle.
  Something that moves away from me when I would touch it with my hand.

  Cities of the beyond, what great black-walled horizons
  Dare you climb up, and down what steep incredible valleys?
  I suddenly perceive that I have been mocked in you,
  And therefore will I sow the earth with rain of stars to-night.
  It is the last night that I can be solitary;
  The rain invites to drunkenness: the wind blows
  through my brain.

  Shiplike the sliding golden trams
  Procession by and intercross:
  With tulips, daffodils, crocuses
  The whole street blossoms at my feet:
  Now kindle, flames, and let blow out
  The crimson rose against the grey,
  Let night itself be blotted out
  In life's monotonous drone of day.

  It is the last night that I can be solitary:
  It is the last time that no feet
  But mine can beat upon the floor;
  It is the last time that no hands
  But mine can pound upon my heart;
  It is the last time that no voice
  But mine can cry and yet be lost;
  It is the last time I shall see
  The pavements like a mirror stare at me.




  GREEN SYMPHONY



  The glittering leaves of the rhododendrons
  Balance and vibrate in the cool air;
  While in the sky above them
  White clouds chase each other.

  Like scampering rabbits,
  Flashes of sunlight sweep the lawn;
  They fling in passing
  Patterns of shadow,
  Golden and green.

  With long cascades of laughter,
  The mating birds dart and swoop to the turf:
 'Mid their mad trillings
  Glints the gay sun behind the trees.

  Down there are deep blue lakes:
  Orange blossom droops in the water.

  In the tower of the winds,
  All the bells are set adrift:
  Jingling
  For the dawn.

  Thin fluttering streamers
  Of breeze lash through the swaying boughs,
  Palely expectant
  The earth receives the slanting rain.

  I am a glittering raindrop
  Hugged close by the cool rhododendron.
  I am a daisy starring
  The exquisite curves of the close-cropped turf.

  The glittering leaves of the rhododendron
  Are shaken like blue-green blades of grass,
  Flickering, cracking, falling:
  Splintering in a million fragments.

  The wind runs laughing up the slope
  Stripping off handfuls of wet green leaves,
  To fling in peoples' faces.
  Wallowing on the daisy-powdered turf,
  Clutching at the sunlight,
  Cavorting in the shadow.

  Like baroque pearls,
  Like cloudy emeralds,
  The clouds and the trees clash together;
  Whirling and swirling,
  In the tumult
  Of the spring,
  And the wind.






  The trees splash the sky with their fingers,
  A restless green rout of stars.

  With whirling movement
  They swing their boughs
  About their stems:
  Planes on planes of light and shadow
  Pass among them,
  Opening fanlike to fall.

  The trees are like a sea;
  Tossing;
  Trembling,
  Roaring,
  Wallowing,
  Darting their long green flickering fronds up at the sky,
  Spotted with white blossom-spray.

  The trees are roofs:
  Hollow caverns of cool blue shadow,
  Solemn arches
  In the afternoons.
  The whole vast horizon
  In terrace beyond terrace,
  Pinnacle above pinnacle,
  Lifts to the sky
  Serrated ranks of green on green.

  They caress the roofs with their fingers,
  They sprawl about the river to look into it;
  Up the hill they come
  Gesticulating challenge:
  They cower together
  In dark valleys;
  They yearn out over the fields.

  Enamelled domes
  Tumble upon the grass,
  Crashing in ruin
  Quiet at last.

  The trees lash the sky with their leaves,
  Uneasily shaking their dark green manes.






  Far let the voices of the mad wild birds be calling me,
  I will abide in this forest of pines.

  When the wind blows
  Battling through the forest,
  I hear it distantly,
  The crash of a perpetual sea.

  When the rain falls,
  I watch silver spears slanting downwards
  From pale river-pools of sky,
  Enclosed in dark fronds.

  When the sun shines,
  I weave together distant branches till they enclose mighty circles,
  I sway to the movement of hooded summits,
  I swim leisurely in deep blue seas of air.

  I hug the smooth bark of stately red pillars
  And with cones carefully scattered
  I mark the progression of dark dial-shadows
  Flung diagonally downwards through the afternoon.

  This turf is not like turf:
  It is a smooth dry carpet of velvet,
  Embroidered with brown patterns of needles and cones.
  These trees are not like trees:
  They are innumerable feathery pagoda-umbrellas,
  Stiffly ungracious to the wind,
  Teetering on red-lacquered stems.

  In the evening I listen to the winds' lisping,
  While the conflagrations of the sunset flicker and clash behind me,
  Flamboyant crenellations of glory amid the charred ebony boles.

  In the night the fiery nightingales
  Shall clash and trill through the silence:
  Like the voices of mermaids crying
  From the sea.

  Long ago has the moon whelmed this uncompleted temple.
  Stars swim like gold fish far above the black arches.

  Far let the timid feet of dawn fly to catch me:
  I will abide in this forest of pines:
  For I have unveiled naked beauty,
  And the things that she whispered to me in the darkness,
  Are buried deep in my heart.

  Now let the black tops of the pine-trees break like a spent wave,
  Against the grey sky:
  These are tombs and memorials and temples and altars sun-kindled for me.




  GOLDEN SYMPHONY





  Seen from afar, the city
  To-day is like a golden cloud:
  Strayed from the sky and moulded
  Into dim motionless towers.

  Music is passing far off:
  Music serenely
  Is climbing up and vanishing
  On the long grey stairways of the sky,
  In fanlike rays of light.

  Now it falls slowly,
  Careering, toppling,
  Shivering and quivering like burnished glass or laburnum-blossom,
  Golden cascades.

  Peace: now let the music
  Sound from further away,
  Red bells out of memory's
  Blue dream of regret.

  Seen from afar, the city
  To-day is like a fleet of sails:
  Breaking the foam of dark forests,
  In which I have strayed so long.

  They march together slowly,
  The golden temple terraces,
  Against the dark remembrance
  Of my pools of despair.

  O golden angelus that sounded prolonging uncertain memories,
  I have seen the swallows hovering to you and followed their dark trails
       of passage.

  The gates of the city lie open,
  And the whole world goes homeward,
  Full-pulsing bells in the foreground,
  Catching my soul with them
  On where the sun soars broadly through the incense-dome of the sky.



  High chimes from the belfry;
  The noonday approaches
  With its golden apparel
  Rustling about its feet.

  High dreams of my city,
  Where we, a band of brothers,
  Build our proud dream of beauty
  Before we fall into dust.

  The golden days have come for us:
  With mandolins, sword-thrusts, laughter.
  Even the very dust of the street
  Grows gold beneath our feet.

  Bronze bell-notes poured from deep blue wells:
  Molten gold out of the sky.
  Pillars of yellow marble
  On the summits of which the gods sleep.

  Now we are swimming;
  About us a great golden halo
  Vibrates from us downwards,
  Ebbing its life away.

  Golden clouds are circling
  Like angels and archangels
  About the eye of the sun.

  Flaming sunset:
  Mad conflagrations
  Licking at the earth,
  The blue-black walls of space,
  Iron mountains vast on the horizon.

  O golden spear that dartled through the darkness!
  The evening star sparkled and threw us its message.



  In the bosom of the desert
  I will lie at the last.

  Not the grey desert of sand
  But the golden desert of great wild grasses,
  This shall receive my soul.

  In the high plateaus,
  The wind will be like a flute-note calling me
  Day after day.

  Short bursts of surf,
  The wind climbs up and stops in the grass;
  And the golden petals
  Brush drowsily over my face.

  White butterfly that flutters across my sea of golden blossom;
  Tell me, what are you looking for, lone white butterfly?

  I am seeking for a strange lonely white flower;
  Its petals are honeyless; and in the wind it is still.

  White butterfly, come, fold your wings over my heart:
  I am the white blossom, the white dead blossom for you.

  In the golden bosom of the prairie,
  I am lying at the last
  Like a pool that is stilled.

  But they who shared with me my life's adventure,
  Who tossed their ducats like dandelions into the sunlight,
  I know that somewhere they with songs are building,
  Golden towers more beautiful than my own.





  I only know in the midnight,
  Something will be born of me.

  The village drowses in the darkness,
  But aloft in the temple
  There is a thud of gongs and a shuffle of hollow voices
  In the dark corridors.

  The golden temple
  That kindled like a rose against the sunset,
  Now is dark and silent,
  One light glimmers from its facade.

  In the inner shrine
  One stiff golden curtain
  Hangs from floor to roof.

  Black, impassive, helmeted
  In felt like stiff black warriors,
  The lamas slowly gather,
  Kneeling in a row.

  The hollow brazen trumpets
  Blare and snore.
  The drums, festooned with skulls,
  Roar.

  Suddenly with a clash of gongs,
  And a squeal from ear-splitting bugles,
  The golden veil is rent.

  Cavernous blue darkness!
  And within it
  Smiling,
  Naked,
  Rose-empurpled,
  Rippling with crimson-violet light, behold the god.

  Hail, great jewel in the lotus blossom!
  Rosy flame that kindling
  Flashes on the emptiness
  Or Nirvana's sea!

  Before the shrine, as before,
  Once more the golden curtain,
  And the black shapes vanish.

  Aloft in the hollow temple
  There is a shuffle of feet and a sound of hollow voices,
  Soon lost.

  The village drowses in the darkness:
  Like a vast black cube
  The temple looms above it,
  There is no light on its facade.

  Suddenly, all the golden temple
  Kindles like a rose against the dawn.

  I only know in the midnight
  Something has been born of me.




  WHITE SYMPHONY


  Forlorn and white,
  Whorls of purity about a golden chalice,
  Immense the peonies
  Flare and shatter their petals over my face.

  They slowly turn paler,
  They seem to be melting like blue-grey flakes of ice,
  Thin greyish shivers
  Fluctuating mid the dark green lance-thrust of the leaves.

  Like snowballs tossed,
  Like soft white butterflies,
  The peonies poise in the twilight.
  And their narcotic insinuating perfume
  Draws me into them
  Shivering with the coolness,
  Aching with the void.
  They kiss the blue chalice of my dreams
  Like a gesture seen for an instant and then lost forever.

         *       *       *       *       *

  Outwards the petals
  Thrust to embrace me,
  Pale daggers of coldness
  Run through my aching breast.

  Outwards, still outwards,
  Till on the brink of twilight
  They swirl downwards silently,
  Flurry of snow in the void.

  Outwards, still outwards,
  Till the blue walls are hidden,
  And in the blinding white radiance
  Of a whirlpool of clouds, I awake.

         *       *       *       *       *

  Like spraying rockets
  My peonies shower
  Their glories on the night.

  Wavering perfumes,
  Drift about the garden;
  Shadows of the moonlight,
  Drift and ripple over the dew-gemmed leaves.

  Soar, crash, and sparkle,
  Shoal of stars drifting
  Like silver fishes,
  Through the black sluggish boughs.

  Towards the impossible,
  Towards the inaccessible,
  Towards the ultimate,
  Towards the silence,
  Towards the eternal,
  These blossoms go.

  The peonies spring like rockets in the twilight,
  And out of them all I rise.






  Downwards through the blue abyss it slides,
  The white snow-water of my dreams,
  Downwards crashing from slippery rock
  Into the boiling chasm:
  In which no eye dare look, for it is the chasm of death.

  Upwards from the blue abyss it rises,
  The chill water-mist of my dreams;
  Upwards to greyish weeping pines,
  And to skies of autumn ever about my heart,
  It is blue at the beginning,
  And blue-white against the grey-greenness;
  It wavers in the upper air,
  Catching unconscious sparkles, a rainbow-glint of sunlight,
  And fading in the sad depths of the sky.

  Outwards rush the strong pale clouds,
  Outwards and ever outwards;
  The blue-grey clouds indistinguishable one from another:
  Nervous, sinewy, tossing their arms and brandishing,
  Till on the blue serrations of the horizon
  They drench with their black rain a great peak of changeless snow.

         *       *       *       *       *

  As evening came on, I climbed the tower,
  To gaze upon the city far beneath:
  I was not weary of day; but in the evening
  A white mist assembled and gathered over the earth
  And blotted it from sight.

  But to escape:
  To chase with the golden clouds galloping over the horizon:
  Arrows of the northwest wind
  Singing amid them,
  Ruffling up my hair!

  As evening came on the distance altered,
  Pale wavering reflections rose from out the city,
  Like sighs or the beckoning of half-invisible hands.
  Monotonously and sluggishly they crept upwards
  A river that had spent itself in some chasm,
  And dwindled and foamed at last at my weary feet.

  Autumn! Golden fountains,
  And the winds neighing
  Amid the monotonous hills:
  Desolation of the old gods,
  Rain that lifts and rain that moves away;
  In the greenback torrent
  Scarlet leaves.

  It was now perfectly evening:
  And the tower loomed like a gaunt peak in mid-air
  Above the city: its base was utterly lost.
  It was slowly coming on to rain,
  And the immense columns of white mist
  Wavered and broke before the faint-hurled spears.

  I will descend the mountains like a shepherd,
  And in the folds of tumultuous misty cities,
  I will put all my thoughts, all my old thoughts, safely to sleep.

  For it is already autumn,
  O whiteness of the pale southwestern sky!
  O wavering dream that was not mine to keep!

         *       *       *       *       *

  In midnight, in mournful moonlight,
  By paths I could not trace,
  I walked in the white garden,
  Each flower had a white face.

  Their perfume intoxicated me: thus I began my dream.

  I was alone; I had no one to guide me,
  But the moon was like the sun:
  It stooped and kissed each waxen petal,
  One after one.

  Green and white was that garden: diamond rain hung in the branches,
  You will not believe it!

  In the morning, at the dayspring,
  I wakened, shivering; lo,
  The white garden that blossomed at my feet
  Was a garden hidden in snow.
  It was my sorrow to see that all this was a dream.




  Blue, clogged with purple,
  Mists uncoil themselves:
  Sparkling to the horizon,
  I see the snow alone.

  In the deep blue chasm,
  Boats sleep under gold thatch;
  Icicle-like trees fret
  Faintly rose-touched sky.

  Under their heaped snow-eaves,
  Leaden houses shiver.
  Through thin blue crevasses,
  Trickles an icy stream.

  The pines groan white-laden,
  The waves shiver, struck by the wind;
  Beyond from treeless horizons,
  Broken snow-peaks crawl to the sea.

         *       *       *       *       *

  Wearily the snow glares,
  Through the grey silence, day after day,
  Mocking the colourless cloudless sky
  With the reflection of death.

  There is no smoke through the pine tops,
  No strong red boatmen in pale green reeds,
  No herons to flicker an instant,
  No lanterns to glow with gay ray.

  No sails beat up to the harbour,
  With creaking cordage and sailors' song.
  Somnolent, bare-poled, indifferent,
  They sleep, and the city sleeps.

  Mid-winter about them casts,
  Its dreary fortifications:
  Each day is a gaunt grey rock,
  And death is the last of them all.

         *       *       *       *       *

  Over the sluggish snow,
  Drifts now a pallid weak shower of bloom;
  Boredom of fresh creation,
  Death-weariness of old returns.

  White, white blossom,
  Fall of the shattered cups day on day:
  Is there anything here that is not ancient,
  That has not bloomed a thousand years ago?

  Under the glare of the white-hot day,
  Under the restless wind-rakes of the winter,
  White blossom or white snow scattered,
  And beneath them, dark, the graves.

  Dark graves never changing,
  White dream drifting, never changing above them:
  O that the white scroll of heaven might be rolled up,
  And the naked red lightning thrust at the smouldering
  earth!




  MIDSUMMER DREAMS

  _(Symphony in White and Blue)_



  There is a tall white weed growing at the top of this sand hill:
  In the grass
  It is very still.

  It lifts its heavy bracts of flattened bloom
  Against the sky
  Hazily grey with brume.

  Out over yonder boats pass
  And the swallows
  Flatten themselves on the grass.

  The lake is silvering beneath the heat.
  The wind's feet
  Touch lazily each crest,
  Like white gulls slow flapping
  To windward.

  One rose white cloud slowly disengages, loosening itself,
  And stands
  Above the larkspur-coloured water:
  Like Dione's daughter
  Braiding up her wet hair with her pale, hands.



  The moon puts out her face at a rift between the trees,
  Which do not lift one drooping leaf, this night of June.
  There is no lazy breeze to set them clashing adrift.

  Thin gleams of silver rise and break in the air,
  Fireflies -- here and there.

  Forest of blue masses suddenly quivering with rapid points of white,
  Are the forests beneath the sea where no breeze passes
  As still as you to-night?

  The moon puts out her face at a rift between the trees;
  Through my window, the bed cut evenly with diagonal shafts of light,
  Is a boat rocking out adrift.

  Under it bend the silver tips of the dark blue coral trees,
  And fireflies like glass fish
  Drift and ripple upwards in the breeze.




  We are drifting slowly, you and I,
  To where the clouds are lifting
  High-fretted towers in the sky:
  Palaces of ivory,
  Which we look at dreamily.
  Over our sail
  Frail white clouds,
  Drift as slowly
  Over the undulant pale blue silk of the water,
  As we.

  We are racing swiftly, you and I,
  The sun darts one firm track
  Through the blue-black
  Of the crinkled water.
  Gold spirals spattering, flashing,
  The water heaves and curls away at our bow,
  A mad fish splashing.

  We are rocked together, you and I,
  To this undulant movement.
  White cloud with blue water blent,
  Cloud dipping down to wave its lazy head,
  Wave curling under cloud its cloudy blue.
  I and you,
  All alone, alone, at last.
  I hold you fast.



  The midsummer clouds were piling up upon the south horizon,
  Mountains of drifting translucence in the larkspur-fields of the sky:
  Ascending and toppling in crumbled ravines, dribbling down chasms
       of silence,
  Reassembling in crowded multitudes, massive forms one above another.
  And I saw in their ridges and hollows, the appearance of a woman
  Immeasurable, carven in stainless marble, motionless, naked, fair:
  Her head thrown back, her pointed breasts up-gleaming in chill sunlight,
  Her heavy flanks dark in the shadow, resting forever inert.
  And up to her there suddenly clomb and hurried another cloud,
  Huge, hairy, bulging, and knobby, with dark and knotted brows:
  And he thrust out long bungling arms to her and drew himself up to her,
  And I watched them melting together, blue mouth to sad white mouth.




  ORANGE SYMPHONY



  Now that all the world is filled
  With armies clamouring;
  Now that men no longer live and die, one by one,
  But in vague indeterminate multitudes:

  Now that the trees are coppery towers,
  Now that the clouds loom southward,
  Now that the glossy creeper
  Spatters the walls like spilt wine:

  I will go out alone,
  To catch strong joy of solitude
  Where the treelines, in gold and scarlet,
  Swing strong grape-cables up the smouldering face of the hill.


  Guns crashing,
  Thudding,
  Ululating,
  Tumultuous.

  Guns yelping over the cracked earth,
  Where dry bugles blare.

  Here in this hollow
  It is very quiet,
  Only the wind's hissing laughter
  In the place of tombs.

  One by one these gaunt scarred faces
  Lift up blurred wrinkled inscriptions
  Silently beseeching me to stop and ponder.
  What does it matter if I do not stop to read them?
  No one at all has gone this way that I have chosen before.

  A leaf drops slowly in silence;
  It is a long time twisting and hovering on its way to
  the earth.

  Guns booming,
  Bellowing,
  Crashing,
  Desperate.
  Insistent outcry of savage guns,
  Rocking the gloomy hollow.

  I will run out like the wind,
  Snarling, with savage laughter;
  Like the wind that tosses the grey-black clouds,
  Against the shot-racked barrier of flaming trees.

  I will race between the grey guns,
  And the clouds, like shrapnel exploding,
  Flinging their hail through the tumult,
  Bursting, will melt in cold spray.

  I am the wanderer of the world;
  No one can hold me.
  Not the cannon assembled for battle,
  Nor the gloomy graves of the hollow,
  Nor the house where I long time slumbered,
  Nor the hilltop where roads are straggling.

  My feet must march to the wind.
  Like a leaf dropping slowly,
  An orange butterfly turning and twisting,
  I touch with moist passionate palms the leaden inscriptions
  Of my past. Then I turn to depart.




  The trees dance about the inn;
  The wind thrusts them into flamelets.
  Now my thoughts gipsying,
  Go forth to strange walls and new fires.

  Mouths stained with brown-red berries,
  Bronzed cheeks sunken, unshaven,
  Ragged attire;
  We swing our guitars at the hip
  As we tramp heedless, uncaring.

  In the inn the fire crackles:
  On the hearth the wine is simmering.
  Lift up the brown beaker one instant,
  Drink deeply -- fling out the last coin -- let us go.
  On the plains there is drooping harvest,
  But no harvest can for long time hold us,
  We have seen the winds, baffled,
  Racing up the orange-flecked trench of the hills.



  On the hill summit
  Where the gusty wind all night long has assailed me,
  Now I see stars vanishing
  Before the long cold clutching fingers of dawn.

  Stars scintillant, fire-hued, metallic,
  Topaz fruit of the deep-blue garden:
  Southward you go, my constellations,
  And leave me with the white day, alone.

  Over the hilltop
  Swish with a scurry of wings
  Millions of pale brown birds,
  Songless, pulsing southward.

  Birds who have filled the trees,
  And who fled long ago at my passing,
  Now you clatter in heedless tumult,
  Fanning with your hot wings my face.

  Carry this word to the southward;
  Say that I have forgotten them that wait for me,
  All the loves and the hates need expect me no longer,
  In the autumn at last I am alone.

  Suddenly
  The wind crashes through the tree-tops,
  Stripping away their orange-tiled domes;
  Stark blue skeletons, forbidding
  Gesticulate in my face.
  You whom I planted and lavished
  With all the wealth and beauty I had to bestow
  Hurry away, vain harvest,
  The winds' scythes can reap you,
  Where you lie on the earth, and to death's barns you can go.

  Beyond the hilltop
  I have seen only the sky.
  The wind, naked, prodding up black-furred clouds,
  Cossacks of winter.

  Cry, wind,
  Shriek to the shivering southland,
  That I am going into winter,
  That I do not hope to return.

  Farewell, crowded stars,
  Farewell, birds, winds, clouds and tree-tops,
  I, weary of you all, seek my destined joy in the north-land,
  Amid blue ice and the rose-purple night of the pole.



  Beyond the land there lies the sea;
  And on the sea with wings unfurled,
  Bloodily huge the sunset rests,
  Feathers flickering and claws curled,
  Watching to seize the ruined world.

  Rolling in a torrent,
  Brown leaves, my achievements,
  Rise up from dark-wooded valleys
  And scatter themselves on the sea;
  Brown birds, my wild dreams,
  Mingle their bodies together,
  Shrieking and clamouring as they pass,
  Black charred silhouettes
  Against the west, curtained in orange flame.
  Now the wind starts up
  And strikes the seething water:
  Hissing in uncoiled fury
  Each foam-curled wave darts forward
  To clash and batter
  The smouldering iron-rust cliff,
  Where the end of my road is lost.

  Rise up, black clouds;
  Pounce upon the sunset:
  Tear it with your jagged teeth.
  Fling yourselves, seething winds, in circles
  Upon the blue-black water,
  Swirl, leaves, and dance
  Amid the chaos of breakers,
  Flicker, birds, an instant
  Against the tawny tiger throat of the sun
  Which is snarling in the west.
  Beat down, O great winds, westward,
  Loose reins and gallop to seaward,
  Rush me, too, to that ocean,
  In which I have found my goal.

  Lash me, lap me, rugged waves of blue-black water,
  Dash me, clutch me and do not let me rest one instant;
  All through the purple-blue night rock and soothe me,
  Till I awaken dreamingly at the faint rose breast of the dawn.




  RED SYMPHONY



  Over the ink-black cauldron of the sea,
  Heavily, on wings of leaden cloud,
  Howling the sunset
  Races out to assail me.

  Long have I voyaged,
  Night after night the grey rains swept the sea:
  The heaving breakers
  Hissed and quivered but held no light.

  Now my voyage is ending,
  White storm winds have swept bare my soul;
  With their harsh laughter,
  Their maddening mockery,
  Their bayonet-thrusts of despair.

  Over the keen, clean-swept zenith
  Roll crushingly, huge masses of cloud:
  Dull, ponderous, sagging with the burden
  Of creaking snow.

  They drop flat on the sea,
  They hang menacing over me,
  They festoon the sun
  With swags of crimson light.

  They stripe the horizon,
  They bar every way with their iron tongues;
  They loom weltering over my effort,
  They steadfastly close me in.

  Meanwhile the sun
  With dying force
  Wrenches one little crack
  In the midst of the sagging masses,
  And I steer on to it.

  Like a crimson lake
  The light overflows and touches the bulging surfaces
  With carmine, with scarlet,
  With orange, with vermillion,
  With brick red, with bluish purple,
  With maroon, with rose, with russet,
  With savage green, with snowy blue,
  With grey, with ebony, with gold.

  It is the storm of the evening
  That races out shrieking
  To assail me,
  And I hail it.




  The sky's vast emptiness
  Is crowded with fragments colliding,
  Ragged, splintered masses
  Swirling away to the night.

  The volcano of the sun
  Has burst and split its crater:
  Black slag is hurled to the zenith
  Above the red lava-sea.

  Black shrivelled, charred fragments
  Fall into the scarlet torrent:
  Huge tresses of darkness sweep over my face,
  Leaving me choking.

  The sea is one crimson steaming fire;
  Each fanged wavelet
  Flickers and dances about the one behind it,
  Hungrily licking at the ship.

  Fierce whirling swords,
  Tossed spear-heads lancelike
  Spit and stab, then suddenly fall
  Leaving me there
  On a rolling summit of flame, facing a gulf of despair.

  The ship
  Lurches
  With ice-crusted prow into the wave-trough;
  And rises, rapidly dripping liquid lire,
  Long twisted necklaces, that burn out to green frozen chrysolite.



  Over my head a bell beats: it is midnight.
  Perhaps I will live to the dawn.

  About me are the mouths of yawning furnaces
  And from these scarlet mouths the heat outpours,
  And darts and licks its dry tongues at my brain
  Till it, too, seems a black shell almost bursting
  With the force of flame in it.

  Still, wearily, I swing my shovel,
  Spattering the black coal over the palates
  Of the snoring mouths which rapidly swallow.
  There is nothing else to do.

  My legs seem melting away in sweat beneath me:
  In my body my lungs and heart are fighting for air,
  My eyes are seared by the appalling scarlet,
  Of the furnaces about me -- I scarcely-see them -- My
  shovelfuls fall short with every swing.

  Without I hear the battering of the tempest,
  The ship is pounded sideways by black immeasurable wave-thrusts,
  And rising dizzily again, like a half-senseless fighter,
  Is again sent downwards, by those unseen fists.

  My shovel rises to the ship's slow recovery,
  My shovel shoots out at the smash of toppling masses,
  Sometimes I pause and pant for an endless instant,
  While the ship crouches, quivering.

  Over my head a bell beats: it is morning.
  Wearily I drop the shovel,
  And drag myself to the deck.



  Afar
  There is something that seems a shore;
  The sky has been blown clean of clouds except to westward,
  And these stare hard at me, like huge sardonyx towers.

  I cling to a half-shattered rail that reels and dances,
  Soused by the choking water,
  My face a streaming mass of blood and salt and grime,
  I wait and dizzily I try to remember.

  What is this city that out there awaits me?
  Am I its conqueror?

  Will scarlet flags hang fluttering in the streets
  To greet my coming?
  Will crimson lanterns
  Jingle and toss in festival to-night?

  Has the fire burned the ship and is the water
  But stinging icy fire,
  That whips and sears my face?

  Down there the furnaces go out, for the water
  Sloshes about the floor;
  And steaming acrid fumes arise,
  No living soul could stay in such a place.

  Out here the decks are shattered,
  The boats are shorn away,
  And far on the horizon,
  The city glares with its sardonyx towers.

  Now the red bells,
  The black-red bells,
  The storm bells,
  Break loose from the horizon,
  Leaping upon the eastern sea,
  And breaking it in their teeth.

  The towers
  Infuriate, enkindle
  From base to summit,
  In layers, and orange terraces,
  Against the blue snow haze that drifts down on them from the east.

  The ship of my soul
  Is rolling to port at last,
  With one clang from its heaving boilers,
  One sigh from its shaking funnels,
  One rattle from its loosened chains.
  I will lash myself to the masthead
  And wait
  Empty-eyed and open-mouthed,
  Till the city that is all one scarlet flame of death
  Takes me to itself at last.




  VIOLET SYMPHONY




  But yesterday
  Moonsails were raking high the harbour of my dreams.

  Dull night of trees,
  Dark sorrows drooping,
  Glittering raindrops gleam on you
  In recollection
  Of my despair.

  But yesterday
  Stardust was scattered deep on the dark gulf of my dreams.

  Wind of the night,
  Questing, swaying, calling,
  Rustle of dull grasses,
  Why do you trouble me?

  Yesterday
  Purple mist was powdered on the windless sea of dreams.

  Faces of the night that pass me,
  Haggard, monotonous faces,
  Windblown hair and lustful lips,
  I am not what you desire.

  Yesterday
  One -- two -- sails above the mist -- .
  Windswallows that hover
  Towards the rainclouds of the horizon,
  Out of the reedy harbours
  Rocking, swaying, falling,
  Blown to sea and parted
  Yesterday,
  Yesterday.



  Purple-blue bloom of night,
  Globed grapes clustered morosely
  Down the dark vineyards of untrodden streets:

  The noise of the moments is like the clash of the hoofs of a horse
       rattling,
  Thin tattoo in the stillness:
  The noise of the moments takes me, uncaring,
  Towards the day.

  With brassy crash, dawn's corybants
  Invade and trample the vineyard:
  Like a faun I hide and watch them,
  A dark cup in my hand.

  Spoilers of my vineyard,
  Spilling the lees of my sweet red wine,
  You will yet ask in vain for a cup that is not yours,
  A purple, dewy cup of lonely night.

  Tramplers in the morning,
  Sunburnt faces and weary lips,
  There is yet a cup here you cannot have,
  I hold it in my hands.

  Would you drink of it?
  Lay down your thyrse and timbrel.
  Break the harsh dance that flickers through the morning,
  Forget the scarlet perfumes of the day.

  Remember only starless night, cool swish of many seas.

  Faint pearl-glow of evening,
  Cool marble in the silence:
  Purple-blue grapes of night crushed freshly,
  Deep sleep and the drowsy stars.



  I love the night that in long violet shroud
  Slowly and lovingly wraps up the day,
  Hiding its blurred imperfections
  In endless tenderness.

  I love the day's
  High violet cone of light,
  With thin haze on the horizon
  Like a wavering summer sea.

  But most of all I love midsummer dawn,
  When far-off planes of light ascend and tremble together
  Like distant purple waves, the sound of whose dim breaking
  Is lost in the wild babel of awaking birds.



  Twisted fragments of violet paper,
  The dawn drops you
  Into the green bowl filled with the day's grey waves.

  I love the night's
  Deep purple grapes
  That yesterday
  Were crushed and spilled,
  In long and sluggish rivers
  That joined and made a sea,
  Where, half-guessed through the mist,
  Two golden sails
  Drifted on silently.

  The blue fume of my dreams
  Is laced with violet flame.

  One golden sail alone came back to rest
  In its nest
  Among the reeds.
  The other sail is lost;
  Behind the mist,
  Beyond the craggy rock,
  About which race in jagged white
  The waves,
  Horizon on horizon far away
  She waits.
  But through the day,
  Comes no faint song, nor creaking of the ropes.

  Twisted fragments of violet paper,
  Charred and fallen:
  Out of the green bowl lazily coils grey smoke.




  GREY SYMPHONY


  Up on the hillside a long row of larches
  Shake from their grizzled Beards the vestiges of rain,
  From grey-blue melting ice-slabs 'neath their arches
  The spring goes up again.

  Writhing, exuding,
  Up-steaming, streaming,
  The earth is breathing to the sky
  Wet clouds of spring.

  Dim rosy fans, the trees
  As they flick to and fro,
  Seem driving greyish vapour
  Over the snow.

  The sky remodulates itself
  From violet-grey to blue,
  Under the upturned eaves of the blue larches
  The sun looks through.

  Now with the heat of the sun
  The grey-blue ice-slabs quiver,
  They slide in muddy trickles
  Towards the river.

  Up on the hillside between the long row of larches
  Fume up from south pale clouds that bear the rain;
  In pearl and violet arches
  They break and shape again.



  I have seen in the evening
  The greyish-violet clouds
  Roll wearily back from northward
  To the place whence first they came.

  One or two orange lamps burnt low
  Against deep purple hills -- 

  The wind was hurrying, bundling them together,
  The pines awoke to sing
  The song of the snow buzzing and screaming
  On its one string.

  I have seen within my heart
  Crocuses, purple and gold,
  Drop cold and dull and colourless
  Beneath the snow.

  One or two orange lamps burnt low,
  Vain memories.

  The wind has driven me too many winters,
  My songs are snowflakes whirling about my breast.
  I will wrap my frozen and bitter songs about me,
  In one grey drift, and rest.





  Fluttering and soft the snow
  Flings outward, swirls and settles,
  But when I try to seize it,
  The wind tears it away.

  Through poised green platforms of enormous pines,
  I see far hilltops pushing up blue roofs.
  Snow comes,
  And hums
  Through the woof
  Of the lower branches.
  It skips and dances:
  It drops in sluggish folds
  Of grey,
  To where the frozen rhododendron bushes
  With lower air-gusts play,
  And the earth hushes
  Its movement.

  Fluttering and soft the snow is blent
  In long loose spirals with my dream.

  It is all I have, the snow,
  And I know
  That when I chase it, it will fly from me;
  Beyond the lifeless green,
  Beyond the low blue hills,
  Beyond the pale straw-coloured glare,
  Down in the west
  It goes;
  Straight southward where the purple-orange flare
  Of sunset flows,
  And into the blackened heart of my last rose
  Pours its despair.

  Fluttering, soft, and dim
  Regrets that skip and skim
  Grey in the grey twilight;
  Slim and weary whirls the snow,
  And where it goes I too shall go.


  Of my long nights afar in alien cities
  I have remembered only this:
  They were black scarves all dusted over with silver,
  In which I wrapped my dreams;
  They were black screens on which I made those pictures
  That faded out next day.

  Youth without glory, manhood one mad struggle,
  Maturity a battle without trumpet calls:
  Long gleams from pallid suns seen only in my dreaming
  Struck those dissolving walls.

  And of my days,
  I only know
  They slipped and fell,
  Like too-brief sunsets,
  Into the hill-ravines that held the snow.
  Three lofty pines
  At the corners of my heart
  Waited, apart.

  They only see
  In the mystery
  Of the grey sky,
  The jaggled clouds that fly,
  Endlessly.




  POPPIES OF THE RED YEAR

  _(A Symphony in Scarlet)_



  The words that I have written
  To me become as poppies:
  Deep angry disks of scarlet flame full-glowing in the stillness
  Of a shut room.

  Silken their edges undulate out to me,
  Drooping on their hairy stems;
  Flaring like folded shawls, down-curved like rockets starting
  To break and shatter their light.

  Wide-flaunting and heavy, crinkle-lipped blossom,
  Darting faint shivers through me;
  Globed Chinese lanterns on green silk cords a-swaying
  Over motionless pools.

  These are lamps of a festival of sleep held each night to welcome me,
  Crimson-bursting through dark doors.
  Out to the dull, blue, heavy fumes of opium rolling
  From their rent red hearts, I go to seek my dream.



  A riven wall like a face half torn away
  Stares blankly at the evening:
  And from a window like a crooked mouth
  It barks at the sunset sky.

  And over there, beyond,
  On plains where night has settled,
  Ten-like encampments of vaporous blue smoke or mist,
  Three men are riding.

  One of them looks and sees the sky:
  One of them looks and sees the earth:
  The last one looks and sees nothing at all.
  They ride on.

  One of them pauses and says, It is death.
  Another pauses and says, It is life.
  The last one pauses and says, 'Tis a dream.
  His bridle shakes.

  The sky
  Is filled with oval violet-tinted clouds
  Through which the sun long settled strikes at random,
  Enkindling here and there blotched circles of rosy light.

  These are poppies,
  Unclosing immense corollas,
  Waving the horsemen on.

  Over the earth, upheaving, folding,
  They ride: their bridles shake:
  One of them sees the sky is red:
  One of them sees the earth is dark:
  The last man sees he rides to his death,
  Yet he says nothing at all.


  There will be no harvest at all this year;
  For the gaunt black slopes arising
  Lift the wrinkled aching furrows of their fields, falling away,
  To the rainy sky in vain.

  But in the furrows
  There is grass and many flowers.
  Scarlet tossing poppies
  Flutter their wind-slashed edges,
  On which gorged black flies poise and sway in drunken sleep.

  The black flies hang
  Above the tangled trampled grasses,
  Grey, crumpled bundles lie in them:
  They sprawl,
  Heave faintly;
  And between their stiffened fingers,
  Run out clogged crimson trickles,
  Spattering the poppies and standing in beads on the grass.


  I saw last night
  Sudden puffs of flame in the northern sky.

  The sky was an even expanse of rolling grey smoke,
  Lit faintly by the moon that hung
  Its white face in a dead tree to the east.

  Within the depths of greenish greyish smoke
  Were roars,
  Crackles and spheres of vapour,
  And then
  Huge disks of crimson shooting up, falling away.

  And I said these are flower petals,
  Sleep petals, dream petals,
  Blown by the winds of a dream.

  But still the crimson rockets rose.
  They seemed to be
  One great field of immense poppies burning evenly,
  Casting their viscid perfume to the earth.

  The earth is sown with dead,
  And out of these the red
  Blooms are pushing up, advancing higher,
  And each night brings them nigher,
  Closer, closer to my heart.


  By the sluggish canal
  That winds between thin ugly dunes,
  There are no passing boats with creaking ropes to-day.

  But when the evening
  Crouches down, like a hurt rabbit,
  Under the everlasting raincloud whirling up the north horizon,
  Downwards on the stream will float
  Glowing points of fire.

  Orange, coppery, scarlet,
  Crimson, rosy, flickering,
  They pass, the lanterns
  Of the unknown dead.

  Out where the sea, sailless,
  Is mouthing and fretting
  Its chaos of pebbles and dried sticks by the dunes.

  By the wall of that house
  That looks like a face half torn away,
  And from its flat mouth barks at the sky,
  The sky which is shot with broad red disks of light,
  Petals drowsily falling.




  It was not for a sacred cause,
  Nor for faith, nor for new generations,
  That unburied we roll and float
  Beneath this flaming tumult of drunken sleep-flowers.
  But it was for a mad adventure,
  Something we longed for, poisonous, seductive,
  That we dared go out in the night together,
  Towards the glow that called us,
  On the unsown fields of death.

  Now we lie here reaped, ungarnered,
  Red swaths of a new harvest:
  But you who follow after,
  Must struggle with our dream:
  And out of its restless and oppressive night,
  Filled with blue fumes, dull, choking,
  You will draw hints of that vision
  Which we hold aloof in silence.

Prufrock and Other Observations


The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock

 Let us go then, you and I,
 When the evening is spread out against the sky
 Like a patient etherized upon a table;
 Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,
 The muttering retreats
 Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels
 And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:
 Streets that follow like a tedious argument
 Of insidious intent
 To lead you to an overwhelming question ...
 Oh, do not ask, What is it?
 Let us go and make our visit.

 In the room the women come and go
 Talking of Michelangelo.

 The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,
 The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes,
 Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening,
 Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains,
 Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,
 Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,
 And seeing that it was a soft October night,
 Curled once about the house, and fell asleep.

 And indeed there will be time
 For the yellow smoke that slides along the street,
 Rubbing its back upon the window-panes;
 There will be time, there will be time
 To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;
 There will be time to murder and create,
 And time for all the works and days of hands
 That lift and drop a question on your plate;
 Time for you and time for me,
 And time yet for a hundred indecisions,
 And for a hundred visions and revisions,
 Before the taking of a toast and tea.

 In the room the women come and go
 Talking of Michelangelo.

 And indeed there will be time
 To wonder, Do I dare? and, Do I dare?
 Time to turn back and descend the stair,
 With a bald spot in the middle of my hair -- 
 (They will say: How his hair is growing thin!)
 My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,
 My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin -- 
 (They will say: But how his arms and legs are thin!)
 Do I dare
 Disturb the universe?
 In a minute there is time
 For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.

 For I have known them all already, known them all:
 Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,
 I have measured out my life with coffee spoons;
 I know the voices dying with a dying fall
 Beneath the music from a farther room.
   So how should I presume?
 And I have known the eyes already, known them all -- 
 The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,
 And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,
 When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,
 Then how should I begin
 To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?
   And how should I presume?

 And I have known the arms already, known them all -- 
 Arms that are braceleted and white and bare
 (But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!)
 Is it perfume from a dress
 That makes me so digress?
 Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl.
   And should I then presume?
   And how should I begin?

           *         *         *         *

 Shall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets
 And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes
 Of lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows? ...

 I should have been a pair of ragged claws
 Scuttling across the floors of silent seas.

           *         *         *         *

 And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!
 Smoothed by long fingers,
 Asleep ... tired ... or it malingers,
 Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me.
 Should I, after tea and cakes and ices,
 Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?
 But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,
 Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter,
 I am no prophet -- and here's no great matter;
 I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,
 And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,
 And in short, I was afraid.

 And would it have been worth it, after all,
 After the cups, the marmalade, the tea,
 Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,
 Would it have been worth while,
 To have bitten off the matter with a smile,
 To have squeezed the universe into a ball
 To roll it toward some overwhelming question,
 To say: I am Lazarus, come from the dead,
 Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all -- 
 If one, settling a pillow by her head,
   Should say: That is not what I meant at all;
   That is not it, at all.

 And would it have been worth it, after all,
 Would it have been worth while,
 After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,
 After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the
     floor -- 
 And this, and so much more? -- 
 It is impossible to say just what I mean!
 But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen:
 Would it have been worth while
 If one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl,
 And turning toward the window, should say:
   That is not it at all,
   That is not what I meant, at all.

           *         *         *         *

 No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;
 Am an attendant lord, one that will do
 To swell a progress, start a scene or two,
 Advise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool,
 Deferential, glad to be of use,
 Politic, cautious, and meticulous;
 Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse;
 At times, indeed, almost ridiculous -- 
 Almost, at times, the Fool.

 I grow old ... I grow old ...
 I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.

 Shall I part my hair behind? Do I dare to eat a peach?
 I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach.
 I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.

 I do not think that they will sing to me.

 I have seen them riding seaward on the waves
 Combing the white hair of the waves blown back
 When the wind blows the water white and black.
 We have lingered in the chambers of the sea
 By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown
 Till human voices wake us, and we drown.




Portrait of a Lady

 Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon
 You have the scene arrange itself -- as it will seem to do -- 
 With I have saved this afternoon for you;
 And four wax candles in the darkened room,
 Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,
 An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb
 Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.
 We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole
 Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger tips.
 So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul
 Should be resurrected only among friends
 Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
 That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room.
 -- And so the conversation slips
 Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
 Through attenuated tones of violins
 Mingled with remote cornets
 And begins.

 You do not know how much they mean to me, my friends,
 And how, how rare and strange it is, to find
 In a life composed so much, so much of odds and ends,
 (For indeed I do not love it ... you knew? you are not blind!
 How keen you are!)
 To find a friend who has these qualities,
 Who has, and gives
 Those qualities upon which friendship lives.
 How much it means that I say this to you -- 
 Without these friendships -- life, what cauchemar!
 Among the windings of the violins
 And the ariettes
 Of cracked cornets
 Inside my brain a dull tom-tom begins
 Absurdly hammering a prelude of its own,
 Capricious monotone
 That is at least one definite false note.
 -- Let us take the air, in a tobacco trance,
 Admire the monuments
 Discuss the late events,
 Correct our watches by the public clocks.
 Then sit for half an hour and drink our bocks.



 Now that lilacs are in bloom
 She has a bowl of lilacs in her room
 And twists one in her fingers while she talks.
 Ah, my friend, you do not know, you do not know
 What life is, you who hold it in your hands;
 (Slowly twisting the lilac stalks)
 You let it flow from you, you let it flow,
 And youth is cruel, and has no remorse
 And smiles at situations which it cannot see.
 I smile, of course,
 And go on drinking tea.
 Yet with these April sunsets, that somehow recall
 My buried life, and Paris in the Spring,
 I feel immeasurably at peace, and find the world
 To be wonderful and youthful, after all.

 The voice returns like the insistent out-of-tune
 Of a broken violin on an August afternoon:
 I am always sure that you understand
 My feelings, always sure that you feel,
 Sure that across the gulf you reach your hand.

 You are invulnerable, you have no Achilles' heel.
 You will go on, and when you have prevailed
 You can say: at this point many a one has failed.

 But what have I, but what have I, my friend,
 To give you, what can you receive from me?
 Only the friendship and the sympathy
 Of one about to reach her journey's end.

 I shall sit here, serving tea to friends....

 I take my hat: how can I make a cowardly amends
 For what she has said to me?
 You will see me any morning in the park
 Reading the comics and the sporting page.
 Particularly I remark
 An English countess goes upon the stage.
 A Greek was murdered at a Polish dance,
 Another bank defaulter has confessed.
 I keep my countenance,
 I remain self-possessed
 Except when a street piano, mechanical and tired
 Reiterates some worn-out common song
 With the smell of hyacinths across the garden
 Recalling things that other people have desired.
 Are these ideas right or wrong?


 The October night comes down; returning as before
 Except for a slight sensation of being ill at ease
 I mount the stairs and turn the handle of the door
 And feel as if I had mounted on my hands and knees.

 And so you are going abroad; and when do you return?
 But that's a useless question.
 You hardly know when you are coming back,
 You will find so much to learn.
 My smile falls heavily among the bric- -brac.

 Perhaps you can write to me.
 My self-possession flares up for a second;
 This is as I had reckoned.
 I have been wondering frequently of late
 (But our beginnings never know our ends!)
 Why we have not developed into friends.
 I feel like one who smiles, and turning shall remark
 Suddenly, his expression in a glass.
 My self-possession gutters; we are really in the dark.

 For everybody said so, all our friends,
 They all were sure our feelings would relate
 So closely! I myself can hardly understand.
 We must leave it now to fate.
 You will write, at any rate.
 Perhaps it is not too late,
 I shall sit here, serving tea to friends.

 And I must borrow every changing
 find expression ... dance, dance
 Like a dancing bear,
 Cry like a parrot, chatter like an ape.
 Let us take the air, in a tobacco trance -- 

 Well! and what if she should die some afternoon,
 Afternoon grey and smoky, evening yellow and rose;
 Should die and leave me sitting pen in hand
 With the smoke coming down above the housetops;
 Doubtful, for quite a while
 Not knowing what to feel or if I understand
 Or whether wise or foolish, tardy or too soon ...
 Would she not have the advantage, after all?
 This music is successful with a dying fall
 Now that we talk of dying -- 
 And should I have the right to smile?




Preludes


 The winter evening settles down
 With smell of steaks in passageways.
 Six o'clock.
 The burnt-out ends of smoky days.
 And now a gusty shower wraps
 The grimy scraps
 Of withered leaves about your feet
 And newspapers from vacant lots;
 The showers beat
 On broken blinds and chimney-pots,
 And at the corner of the street
 A lonely cab-horse steams and stamps.
 And then the lighting of the lamps.




 The morning comes to consciousness
 Of faint stale smells of beer
 From the sawdust-trampled street
 With all its muddy feet that press
 To early coffee-stands.
 With the other masquerades
 That time resumes,
 One thinks of all the hands
 That are raising dingy shades
 In a thousand furnished rooms.




 You tossed a blanket from the bed,
 You lay upon your back, and waited;
 You dozed, and watched the night revealing
 The thousand sordid images
 Of which your soul was constituted;
 They flickered against the ceiling.
 And when all the world came back
 And the light crept up between the shutters,
 And you heard the sparrows in the gutters,
 You had such a vision of the street
 As the street hardly understands;
 Sitting along the bed's edge, where
 You curled the papers from your hair,
 Or clasped the yellow soles of feet
 In the palms of both soiled hands.



 His soul stretched tight across the skies
 That fade behind a city block,
 Or trampled by insistent feet
 At four and five and six o'clock
 And short square fingers stuffing pipes,
 And evening newspapers, and eyes
 Assured of certain certainties,
 The conscience of a blackened street
 Impatient to assume the world.
 I am moved by fancies that are curled
 Around these images, and cling:
 The notion of some infinitely gentle
 Infinitely suffering thing.
 Wipe your hand across your mouth, and laugh;
 The worlds revolve like ancient women
 Gathering fuel in vacant lots.




Rhapsody on a Windy Night

 Twelve o'clock.
 Along the reaches of the street
 Held in a lunar synthesis,
 Whispering lunar incantations
 Dissolve the floors of the memory
 And all its clear relations,
 Its divisions and precisions,
 Every street lamp that I pass
 Beats like a fatalistic drum,
 And through the spaces of the dark
 Midnight shakes the memory
 As a madman shakes a dead geranium.

 Half-past one,
 The street lamp sputtered,
 The street lamp muttered,
 The street lamp said,
 Regard that woman
 Who hesitates toward you in the light of the door
 Which opens on her like a grin.
 You see the border of her dress
 Is torn and stained with sand,
 And you see the corner of her eye
 Twists like a crooked pin.

 The memory throws up high and dry
 A crowd of twisted things;
 A twisted branch upon the beach
 Eaten smooth, and polished
 As if the world gave up
 The secret of its skeleton,
 Stiff and white.
 A broken spring in a factory yard,
 Rust that clings to the form that the strength has left
 Hard and curled and ready to snap.

 Half-past two,
 The street lamp said,
 Remark the cat which flattens itself in the gutter,
 Slips out its tongue
 And devours a morsel of rancid butter.
 So the hand of a child, automatic
 Slipped out and pocketed a toy that was running along the quay.
 I could see nothing behind that child's eye.
 I have seen eyes in the street
 Trying to peer through lighted shutters,
 And a crab one afternoon in a pool,
 An old crab with barnacles on his back,
 Gripped the end of a stick which I held him.

 Half-past three,
 The lamp sputtered,
 The lamp muttered in the dark.

 The lamp hummed:
 Regard the moon,
 La lune ne garde aucune rancune,
 She winks a feeble eye,
 She smiles into corners.
 She smoothes the hair of the grass.
 The moon has lost her memory.
 A washed-out smallpox cracks her face,
 Her hand twists a paper rose,
 That smells of dust and old Cologne,
 She is alone
 With all the old nocturnal smells
 That cross and cross across her brain.
 The reminiscence comes
 Of sunless dry geraniums
 And dust in crevices,
 Smells of chestnuts in the streets,
 And female smells in shuttered rooms,
 And cigarettes in corridors
 And cocktail smells in bars.

 The lamp said,
 Four o'clock,
 Here is the number on the door.
 Memory!
 You have the key,
 The little lamp spreads a ring on the stair,
 Mount.
 The bed is open; the tooth-brush hangs on the wall
 Put your shoes at the door, sleep, prepare for life.

 The last twist of the knife.




Morning at the Window

 They are rattling breakfast plates in basement kitchens,
 And along the trampled edges of the street
 I am aware of the damp souls of housemaids
 Sprouting despondently at area gates.

 The brown waves of fog toss up to me
 Twisted faces from the bottom of the street,
 And tear from a passer-by with muddy skirts
 An aimless smile that hovers in the air
 And vanishes along the level of the roofs.




The Boston Evening Transcript

 The readers of the Boston Evening Transcript
 Sway in the blind like a field of ripe corn.
 When evening quickens faintly in the street,
 Wakening the appetites of life in some
 And to others bringing the Boston Evening Transcript,
 I mount the steps and ring the bell, turning
 Wearily, as one would turn to nod good-bye to Rochefoucauld
 If the street were time and he at the end of the street,
 And I say, Cousin Harriet, here is the Boston Evening Transcript.




Aunt Helen

 Miss Helen Slingsby was my maiden aunt,
 And lived in a small house near a fashionable square
 Cared for by servants to the number of four.
 Now when she died there was silence in heaven
 And silence at her end of the street.
 The shutters were drawn and the undertaker wiped his feet -- 
 He was aware that this sort of thing had occurred before.
 The dogs were handsomely provided for,
 But shortly afterwards the parrot died too.
 The Dresden clock continued ticking on the mantelpiece,
 And the footman sat upon the dining-table
 Holding the second housemaid on his knees -- 
 Who had always been so careful while her mistress lived.




Cousin Nancy

 Miss Nancy Ellicot
 Strode across the hills and broke them
 Rode across the hills and broke them -- 
 The barren New England hills
 Riding to hounds
 Over the cow-pasture.

 Miss Nancy Ellicott smoked
 And danced all the modern dances;
 And her aunts were not quite sure how they felt about it,
 But they knew that it was modern.

 Upon the glazen shelves kept watch
 Matthew and Waldo, guardians of the faith,
 The army of unalterable law.




Mr. Apollinax

 When Mr. Apollinax visited the United States
 His laughter tinkled among the teacups.
 I thought of Fragilion, that shy figure among the birch-trees,
 And of Priapus in the shrubbery
 Gaping at the lady in the swing.
 In the palace of Mrs. Phlaccus, at Professor Channing-Cheetah's
 He laughed like an irresponsible foetus.
 His laughter was submarine and profound
 Like the old man of the seats
 Hidden under coral islands
 Where worried bodies of drowned men drift down in the green silence,
 Dropping from fingers of surf.
 I looked for the head of Mr. Apollinax rolling under a chair,
 Or grinning over a screen
 With seaweed in its hair.
 I heard the beat of centaurs' hoofs over the hard turf
 As his dry and passionate talk devoured the afternoon.
 He is a charming man -- But after all what did he mean? -- 
 He has pointed ears ... he must be unbalanced, -- 
 There was something he said that I might have challenged.
 Of dowager Mrs. Phlaccus, and Professor and Mrs. Cheetah
 I remember a slice of lemon and a bitten macaroon.




Hysteria

 As she laughed I was aware of becoming involved in her laughter and
 being part of it, until her teeth were only accidental stars with a
 talent for squad-drill. I was drawn in by short gasps, inhaled at
 each momentary recovery, lost finally in the dark caverns of her
 throat, bruised by the ripple of unseen muscles. An elderly waiter
 with trembling hands was hurriedly spreading a pink and white checked
 cloth over the rusty green iron table, saying: If the lady and
 gentleman wish to take their tea in the garden, if the lady and
 gentleman wish to take their tea in the garden ... I decided that
 if the shaking of her breasts could be stopped, some of the fragments
 of the afternoon might be collected, and I concentrated my attention
 with careful subtlety to this end.




Conversation Galante

 I observe: Our sentimental friend the moon
 Or possibly (fantastic, I confess)
 It may be Prester John's balloon
 Or an old battered lantern hung aloft
 To light poor travellers to their distress.
   She then: How you digress!

 And I then: Some one frames upon the keys
 That exquisite nocturne, with which we explain
 The night and moonshine; music which we seize
 To body forth our own vacuity.
   She then: Does this refer to me?
   Oh no, it is I who am inane.

 You, madam, are the eternal humorist
 The eternal enemy of the absolute,
 Giving our vagrant moods the slightest twist
 With your air indifferent and imperious
 At a stroke our mad poetics to confute -- 
   And -- Are we then so serious?




La Figlia Che Piange

 Stand on the highest pavement of the stair -- 
 Lean on a garden urn -- 
 Weave, weave the sunlight in your hair -- 
 Clasp your flowers to you with a pained surprise -- 
 Fling them to the ground and turn
 With a fugitive resentment in your eyes:
 But weave, weave the sunlight in your hair.

 So I would have had him leave,
 So I would have had her stand and grieve,
 So he would have left
 As the soul leaves the body torn and bruised
 As the mind deserts the body it has used.
 I should find
 Some way incomparably light and deft,
 Some way we both should understand,
 Simple and faithless as a smile and shake of the hand.

 She turned away, but with the autumn weather
 Compelled my imagination many days,
 Many days and many hours:
 Her hair over her arms and her arms full of flowers.
 And I wonder how they should have been together!
 I should have lost a gesture and a pose.
 Sometimes these cogitations still amaze
 The troubled midnight and the noon's repose.

Clown's houses

FIREWORKS ON
PINK faces -- (worlds or flowers or seas or stars),
You all alike are patterned with hot bars
of coloured light; and falling where I stand,
The sharp and rainbow splinters from the band
Seem fireworks, splinters of the Infinite -- 
(Glitter of leaves the echoes). And the night
Will weld this dust of bright Infinity
To forms that we may touch and call and see: -- 
Pink pyramids of faces : tulip-trees
Spilling night-perfumes on the terraces.
The music, blond airs waving like a sea
Draws in its vortex of immensity
The new-awakened flower-strange hair and eyes
Of crowds beneath the floating summer skies.
And, 'gainst the silk pavilions of the sea
I watch the people move incessantly
Vibrating, petals blown from flower-hued stars
Beneath the music-fireworks' waving bars ;
So all seems indivisible, at one:
The flow of hair, the flowers, the seas that run,
A coloured floating music of the night
Through the pavilions of the Infinite.


MINSTRELS
BESIDE the sea, metallic-bright
And sequined with the noisy light,
Duennas slowly promenade
Each like a patch of sudden shade,
While colours like a parokeet
Shrill loudly to the chattering heat;
And gowns as white as innocence
With sudden sweetness take the sense.
Those crested paladins the waves
Are sighing to their tawny slaves
The sands, where, orange-turbann'd stand -- 
Opaque black gems -- the negro band !
While in the purring greenery
The crowd moves like a tropic sea -- 
The people, sparkles from the heat
That dies from ennui at our feet.
The instruments that snore like flies
Seem mourners at Time's obsequies.
The sun, a pulse's beat, inflates
And with the band coagulates:
" A thousand years seem but a day -- 
Time waits for no man, yet he'll stay
Bewildered when we cross this bar
Into the Unknown: -- there we are!"


Eternity and Time commence
To merge amid the somnolence
Of winding circles, bend on bend,
With no beginning and no end,
Down which they chase queer tunes that gape
Till they come close,-then just escape!
But though Time's barriers are defied
They never seem quite satisfied.
The crowds, bright sparks struck out by Time,
Pass, touch each other, never chime:
Each soul a separate entity -- 
Some past, some present, some to be:
But now, an empty blot of white,
Beneath the senseless shocks of light
Flashed by the tunes that cannot thrill
The nerves. Oh! Time is hard to kill !

GREEN apples dancing in a wash of sun -- 
Ripples of sense and fun -- 
A net of light that wavers as it weaves
The sunlight on the chattering leaves;
The half-dazed sound of feet,
And carriages that ripple in the heat.
The parasols like shadows of the sun
Cast wavering shades that run
Across the laughing faces and across


Hair with a bird-bright gloss.
The swinging greenery casts shadows dark,
Hides me that I may mark
How, buzzing in this dazzling mesh, my soul
Seems hardening it to flesh, and one bright whole.
O sudden feathers have a flashing sheen!
The sun's swift javelin
The bird-songs seem, that through the dark leaves pass;
And life itself is but a flashing glass.

WHAT THE DEAN SAID TO SILENUS
EXCUSE me, Sir, my plums, I think!
Amid thick leaves I saw the wink
Of bird-black eyes, where on the brink

Of water, trees seem pale as rain,
With watery sounds, -and marked with pain
That you were-at it-once again.
No really, Sir, I must protest;
For you and each shy-footed guest
Have quite deprived me of my rest :
The sap of trees within my veins
And sleepy frondage of my brains
Hurts quite as much as growing pains;
My trees that hung above a pool
Like sleepy clouds of cotton-wool
No longer seem to me so cool.

And on my lawns of parrot-green
Where plumed trees have a bird-quick sheen,
Young persons are distinctly seen,
In colour, really, scarcely nice -- 
Like centaur waves that drip with spice
From Indian isles of ambergris;
Their wilderness of glittering hair
Seems fire-plumed devils of the air. -- 
My sheep, those sparkling clouds, pass there;
And while the heat, red Harlequin,
Plays on the airs for mandoline,
Each in an air-white crinoline
With points like coloured dust of stars -- 
Confetti, or the wavering bars
From sharpened strings of light that mars
The fruit-trees, (cataracts of fire
That in those nets of golden wire
Catch bird-voices to light the pyre
Of cherries) -- teach my sheep to buck;
My apples, red with sleep, they pluck,
And cherries, plums and grapes they suck. -- 
Then, mirage-waters as they flow,
Or dream-perfumes, they fade and go
With movements like a ship and slow.





You'd scarce believe, but till of late
You came, between a man and mate
I scarce could differentiate,
And always thought a double chin
Was incompatible with sin.
And at my age, one can't begin
To study men instead of bees!
My gaiters seem like trunks of trees -- 
Not pillars of the Church that freeze
To stalactites of boredom through
Long centuries of sermons. -- No,
I really think, Sir, you must go!

STRAWBERRY PATHS
THE phantom sun beats hard and dry
All in a painted sky;
The rattling dust like castanets
Reflects the beat it sets

And echoes in it's dazzling glare
The bells that chiming there
Like rainbow splintered glass, let fall
Their prisms over all.

The branching trees seem verdigrised
As founts of steel, released
To catch the sun and hold it fast
In shining cords they cast.
In towers of glass that pierce the skies
The naiad's laughter dies;
And flowers laugh like Harlequin,
All wetted to the skin.
Their sharp scents pierce the glittering air
Like snakish-thin flutes there ;
And some are cold and serpentine:
Gold-diapered their skin
While, dame and poppet, each frilled rose
. That in dark leaves lies close -- 
Nursing her buds, will curtsey low
To see me as I go
Upon the gravelled paths; my plait
Escapes this broad-brimmed hat;
My lips are like ripe strawberries;
One little bird that flies,
Hid in a brown cloak with a tail
Like some small nightingale
Whose hidden name is "Love," would fain
Peck them again-again.

WEATHERCOCKS 
OLD Owl-wing shakes his lap
of money to the peoples:
His stripy dunce's cap
Is twirling on the steeples
With bells of noisy-coloured rain,
He's paid his money, gone to Spain.
And cows and sparkling sheep
In shrill green painted fields
Seem blocks of wood asleep
Or cloud in air that yields;
Like wooden bumpkins' sun-round stare
Clocks seem, in new-washed air:
Bucolic round-faced clocks
That laugh at pirouettes
Of glittering weathercocks
Each preening as he sets
Clouds tumbling like striped coloured clowns
Through all the far blue towns
With thunder drumming after.
A coloured bubble is the world -- 
A glassy ball that clowns have hurled
Through the rainbow space of laughter.


TWO DRUNKARD SONGS
DUCKIE.
THE streets are dancing with my glee -- 
The black streets hurt their stones at me,
Houp-la! the world is gay!

Stairs like cataracts that burst
The sun, a yellow bladder's thirst,
Houp-la! the world is gay!
And as the streets their refuse fling
The ragged skies are fluttering -- 
Houp-la! the world is gay!
Like my black tatters blown by Chance -- 
And all the muslined windows dance
Like little girls at holiday!
The old are young, the young are old,
The sunlight pours all whisky-gold !
Houp-la ! the world is gay!
A puppet on the string of Chance
Through winds of misery I dance -- 
Houp-la! the world is gay!
I was so young and debonair :
My gay feet trod the summer air,
Houp-la! the world is gay!
And now I gnaw my bones for bread
And lying on my naked bed -- 
Houp-la! the world is gay!

I wish I had a wealth of flesh
To sell for bread or gnaw afresh.
Houp-la! the world is gay!

I had a child; but joy had dried
My breast. Grown thirsty too, he died,
Houp-la! the world is gay!
And now I scour for carrion
And live and hope and die alone.
Houp-la! the world is gay!
Toil mangles us till hot blood spirt
Upon the rich. This blackened dirt
Is living, pulsing, breathing clay!
Houp-la! the world is gay!


DOLCE FAR NIENTE.
In the hot summer evenings
We sit in laurel groves,
The sunlight soaks like water through our skins
And we are happy.
We, made of the red clay
Seem as the broken satyrs
Made of terra-cotta
That peer through the numb leaves.
We bask in the hot rays of the brass band
As bright as sunshine,
Invading dusty corners of the soul,
Loosening the trap of flesh
In which we're caught-O God, we're caught -- 
But no-one pities us.
Yet in each blaring tune


We pluck the dewy daisies of the stars
To crown our little love -- 
She in her summer gown
More white than childhood's innocence.
Oh! how the poor dreams fade, dear!
Perhaps they have grown tired -- 
For now we hardly hear
The music that our hearts desired.
And Life is but a roll of oil-cloth, smooth,
Patterned with dusty flowers that never lived
In a narrow passage full of smells of food;
And old Respectability, the spider,
Lurks in dark corners with his many webs
To catch our poor bright dreams, our happy dreams.
The city is hurling its stones as we run:
Stairways like cataracts, bursting the sun.
Belching black laughter, the chimneys and trains
Batter the city and beat
The noise into blindness, till reeling it reins
Our feet.
Saturn the King was as thirsty as Earth,
Soaked with the blood of his children at birth.
Drunk with the bodies we wrought -- 
On sap of their beings we'll fatten like him -- 
Batten and fatten all red at the rim,
And caught
In the trap of our flesh, while the hammer of toil
Beats bloodless our bodies; the rich have made spoil
Of our souls, a black vintage: we'll burst
The bounds of their heaven-they're drunk with our
Let them go sprawling like flies in the mud -- blood,
Accurst!

MYSELF ON THE MERRY-GO-ROUND

THE giddy sun's kaleidescope,
The pivot of a switchback world,
Is tied to it by many a rope:
The people (flaunting streamers), furled
Metallic banners of the seas,
The giddy sun's kaleidescope
Casts colours on the face of these;
Cosmetics of Eternity,
And powders faces blue as death :
Beneath the parasols we see
Gilt faces tarnished by sea-breath,
And crawling like the foam, each horse
Beside the silken tents of sea
In whirlpool circles takes his course.
Huge houses, humped like camels, chase
The wooden horses' ceaseless bound;
The throbbing whirring sun that drags
The streets upon its noisy round
With tramways chasing them in vain,
Projects in coloured cubes each face -- 
Then shatters them upon our brain.
The house-fronts hurl them back, they jar
Upon cross-currents of the noise :
Like atoms of my soul they are,
They shake my body's equipoise, -- 
A clothes line for the Muse to fly
(So thin and jarred and angular)
Her rags of tattered finery.
Beneath the heat the trees' sharp hue -- 
A ceaseless whirr, metallic-green -- 

Sounds like a gimlet shrilling through
The mind, to reach the dazzling sheen
Of meanings life can not decide:
Then words set all awry, and you
Are left upon the other side.
Our senses, each a wooden horse,
We paint till they appear to us
Like life, and then queer strangers course
In our place on each Pegasus.
The very heat seems but to be
The product of some man-made force -- 
Steam from the band's machinery.
The heat is in a thousand rags
Reverberant with sound, whose dry
Frayed ends we never catch, seem tags
Of our unfinished entity;
And like a stretched accordion
The houses throb with heat, and flags
Of smoke are tunes light plays upon.
The band's kaleidescopic whirr
Tears up those jarring threads of heat,
The crowds: plush mantles seem to purr;
Crustacean silk gowns take the beat
From houses ; each reverberates
With this vitality and stir
The giddy heat acerberates.
And in the swirling restaurant
Where liqueurs at perpetual feud
Dispute for sequined lights and taunt
Hot leaves, our dusty souls exude
Their sentiments, while scraps of sense
Float inward from the band and flaunt -- 
Disturb the general somnolence.



BLACK COFFEE
THE lustrous air is echoing like a shell :
The thousand wheels and shafts of fire that fell

Within my sight from carriages that pass
Reverberate like splinters of thin glass -- 
A shivering sound and coloured sparks that drown
My air-white muslin gown. -- 
My wide-brimmed hat was fluted like a shell,
With paper flowers that tell
How in my black hair hide two little horns.
Each marguerite upon the table scorns
(Like pale Autumnal suns) the coffee in the pot -- 
As black as any nigger, and as hot.
And so I sit through the late afternoon -- 
Await, I know not whom, but coming soon.

THE OLD NURSE'S SONG
PTOLEMY, poor Ptolemy,
"In a dusty room doth lie -- 
Beggars for his bedfellows,
Pence upon his eye.
The old men spend his money,
The nursemaids eat his honey -- 
But no one knows at all, my dear,
Where Ptolemy doth lie.
The moon, a milk-white unicorn,
She chased me round the town:
She chased me up and chased me down
She whistled through her horn:
"Go and listen at the keyhole
When the cold wind blows -- 
It's Ptolemy, poor Ptolemy,
A-snoring through his nose.

ROCKING-HORSES
HORSES of wood
For me and for you. -- 
Castles of crystal -- 
Castles of blue.
Nurse's white gown
Shines through the trees
Like a unicorn.-Down. -- 
Up on the breeze.
Foolscap with bells
Hangs on the steeples;
Oh! the flower-smells
Where the sky ripples,
Sky of blue satin.
Horses of wood
(Gee-up in Latin!)
Go as you should.
Soon, oh too soon,
Right over all
Toss the round moon
Like a cowslip ball.


ON THE GUITAR
PANTALOON, oh Pantaloon,
Face all whitened by the moon,
With the Doctor, grown rheumatic,
Sat and quarrelled in the attic:
Tongues as sharp and shrill as grass,
Flames, bright singing-birds that pass.
Came the moon, a painted parrot,
Flashed her wings within the garret,
Left a feather in each head -- 
Whistled once then off to bed.
Oh the foolish flowery note
Poet never learns by rote:
Throw your arms wide, Pantaloon -- 
You will never catch the moon!


VARIATIONS ON AN OLD NURSERY
RHYME
THE King of China's daughter
So beautiful to see
With her face like yellow water, left
Her nutmeg tree.
Her little rope for skipping
She kissed and gave it me -- 
Made of painted notes of singing-birds
Among the fields of tea.
I skipped across the nutmeg grove, -- 
I skipped across the sea;
But neither sun nor moon, my dear,
Has yet caught me.


MARINER-MEN (Presto)
WHAT are you staring at, mariner-man,
Wrinkled as sea-sand and old as the sea ?"
Those trains will run over their tails, if they can -- 
Snorting and sporting like porpoises. Flee
The burly the whirligig wheels of the train,
As round as the world and as large again -- 
Running half the way over to Babylon,-down
fields of clover to gay Troy town -- 
A-puffing their smoke as grey as the curl
On my forehead as wrinkled as sands of the Sea!
But what can that matter to you, my girl?
(And what can that matter to me?)."

PALANQUINS
BLACK palanquins beneath a fateful sky
Sway through the silent multitudes, -- pass by.
Black palanquins with funeral plumes of smoke
Whose tufted darkness brighter echoes woke,
Ripples in molten air, pass silently
Through amber portals of the empty sea.
Vermilion as the masks of emperors
The sky seems splashed with blood. The vast earth roars

It's cosmic laughter, spattered at these gods
Who whipp'd us -- now grown thin as their own rods.

The dust of earth is rustling as it flaunts
And rearing like the trunks of elephants,
With monstrous trumpetings like suns at war -- 
Flaming pavilions of the equator.
Gold faces through the evil tropic air
Like unknown suns or sudden music, blare, -- 
Fanned by the palm-leaves of their negro slaves
Like statues of red coral, washed by waves
Of tropic heat. Now rise upon our sight
The bull-voiced bellowings of monstrous light:
Mimes garbed as aeons, through black vistas drowned
In equatorial vortices of sound.
And all the while the dust is muttering
And we can tell their souls are guttering -- 
The lights we lit, that burned our souls away,
The gods we made, yet could not break, in play;
Old fetishes we gilded with our blood,
Carved with weak hands from our primeval mud.
They draw the curtains. Tears of wicked gold
Drip from their eyelids, blue as ice and cold,
To mock our thirsting. O they weep who could
No longer warm their bodies in our blood

Because the Sun, all masked with gold as they,
Grew thirsty too and drained our blood away.
And now we run toward the empty sea -- 
Grown dry as gold and blind to agony.
We fling our arms toward the sightless sky -- 
All masked with gold. The palanquins pass by.

THE DANCERS
(During a great battle, 1916).
THE floors are slippery with blood :
The world gyrates too. God is good
That while His wind blows out the light
For those who hourly die for us -- 
We still can dance, each night.

The music has grown numb with death,
But we will suck their dying breath,
The whispered name they breathed to chance,
To swell our music, make it loud
That we may dance,-may dance.
We are the dull blind carrion-fly
That dance and batten. Though God die
Mad from the horror of the light -- 
The light is mad, too, flecked with blood, -- 
We dance, we dance, each night.


ACROBATS

WORLD! Fat woman ambling, with your hair
Blond as the locks of Fortune, or the stare
of opulent suns, -- your tights are thought to be
Pink flesh itself, and youth's simplicity.
Beneath the light's complacency and sheen
Metallic waves of people glitter green,
Breaking in foam of waving handkerchiefs
With a numb sound like lolling furry leaves.
The brass band winnows thoughts like coloured dust
Or feverish confetti when the lust
Of eve for night turns people pink as prawns;
Or when those silver mirrors for strange dawns,
The bird-songs, show a blurred confuse of faces,
And while she convolutes with worm-like graces,
I throw my bouquet with the rest : gilt loads
Of calceolarias, shaped like sleepy toads,
Yellow and spotted as old Mammon's thumb
And velvet as the air gold-shot and numb.

Yet why should poets be constrained to bare
Mock souls, fat Acrobatics at a Fair,
In pink tights, imitative flesh; their goal
To be admired for fatted weight of Soul?


PLUTOCRACY AT PLAY
FROM gilded house to gilded play
Plutocracy has paid its way
To sip that well-confectioned soul -- 
The vanille-tainted Barcarolle,

The iced veneer that violins made;
Great mirrors green as lemonade
Show tiers on tiers of gilded curls
Rococo profiles, rows of pearls.

Submerged within a wavy sea
Of plush, our great Plutocracy
Once more like swan-white water-girls
Prepare to catch the notes as pearls.

Portentous women splash like whales
Amid the froth of talk; and scales
Of lights glance on their surface, wink
And wish their jewels were good to drink;

And in the music's tepid seas
Bald heads seem red anemones
With gold fringe swelling on the tide;
The froth of conversation died.

The music's glutinous sweet flood
Crawls in their veins instead of blood ;
Eyes glitter like the scales of fish
With some half-formed Hebraic wish;

And on the airs that proudly swell
Each plutocratic Ariel
(Wafted upon a half-formed sigh)
Finds heavenly courts are not too high;
Whose pastoral life befits their rank
With field of commerce, marbled bank,
Where seated, the Eternal Nose
Finds out the worm within their rose :
"Let those exalted be brought low" -- 
And noses follow suit, you know
So on the cushioned ecstasy
Of music, our Plutocracy
Exudes the glucose of its soul -- 
The vanille-tainted Barcarolle
Mid tiers on tiers of gilded curls -- 
Rococo profiles, rows of pearls.


THE MADNESS OF SAUL
SAUL.
ATARAH (mother of Saul and Tiras).
AMASA (their old nurse).
CHORUS OF ETHIOPIAN WOMEN.
SEMICHORUS I.
VINEYARDS of the world, cry to the Dawn -- 
Great streams of light that water all the world
And flow like music in our veins, bring life
To those unborn. O founts and waterways
Of the young light, flow down and lie like peace
Upon the upturned faces of the blind.
For all the winds and wings of the wide dark
Fan us to flame, and, Mother of the world,
I stand with hands upraised to the young Day.
SEMICHORUS II
The Sun's wide wings have fanned our bodies black:
With eyelids like the flashing of a sword
And lips like fire of flowers or frankincense
We builded Day with our immortal kiss.
We bring thee flowers, some pale with unshed tears,
All lustrous with the echoes of the dawn,
And perfumed with the light, or flame of flowers
As yellow as the hair of lacchus -- 
They grew in palace portals of the Sun.
And these shall touch the eyelids of the moon
With slumber, fill with music the chill air.
SEMICHORUS I.
O we are black because the heat hath kissed
Our lips, those heavy grapes, and laid a kiss
On eyelids like the chambers of the South

Wherefrom the sweet light drips for frankincense.
And we have brought you flowers-mounds of silver,
And full of chilly bubbles for the bees.
SEMICHORUS II.
We sat beside the rivers and we wept,
For we are black beneath the Sun's hot kiss.
The Sun hath left his tent and kissed our breasts
Till they were sweeter than the budding grapes -- 
The savour of our eyelids seemed the morn.
And then She came, the music of the air,
And all the old worlds died away like dew.
SEMICHORUS I.
We are the perfumed portals of the dawn,
We are the flowering vineyards of the Sun
That break in music, glorify the Lord.
Our heartstrings like the music of the suns
Echo across the splendour of the earth,
And Time, a fiery dew, upon our hair
Is shed and fades; with lips and veins I cry -- 
Light fills me, light invades me, light is life.
(ENTER SAUL).
SEMICHORUS II.
I heard a cry that rustled through the day:
Broad rivers fanned by wings of many winds
Have such a sound. `But then it died again.
And all night long I heard the tread of Doom.
SAUL.
Why have you slain the Sun? He was my brother.
He kills the one he loves. So brothers do.

(CHORUS I.
The Sun hath golden feet to crush our grapes:
all the grapes of joy grew ripe too soon.

SAUL.
is but dew, though clotted with thick misery.
came, a fiery sun, to drain my life,
she hath kissed me, melted up my veins.
ATARAH).

hold me -- broken on the wheel of light.
footsteps are the tread of blinded Boom.
CHORUS.
Thy body reels as though some unheard wind
broken from Hell, blew on thee. What is this?
ATARAH.
Slain, slain, and by the hand of his own brother.
CHORUS.
Thy lips are red, but not with blood of fruits.
ATARAH.
I kissed my son. My lips shall wither now.
CHORUS.
And thou art clothed with trembling like the grass.
ATARAH.
My name is Madness, I whose face was light.
  Thus I exhale from all the chasms of life -- 
Till heaven is broken into dust, and dies.
CHORUS
Queen, old age clear and terrible as noon
Thy face hath gathered darkness from the heavens.
ATARAH.
Pull down the heavens, seal mine eyes with night.
O emptiness sifts endlessly -- they rock, come down.
I had two eyes, and she has blinded them
Two breasts to feed the world: she hacked them off.
These were my sons, twin-born, my roots of life:
And she has torn my roots, I drift through space.
SAUL.
Cry, tear the fabric of the world with screams.
This whirlpool of my madness has sucked down
The palaces of light into its depths.
The pulsing earth is ashen-black as night:
They say it is with drought,-old thirsty ape!
There is no thirst save in my empty veins.
She came, a snake, and stabbed my veins with love:
Her fangs grew in my blood. I killed my brother.
ATARAH.
You should have stabbed my womb, Saul, my son Saul.
SAUL.
O that my tired body could find sleep
Once more within your dark womb, O my mother.
ATARAH.
The earth is drunken with my lamentation
And night invades my veins and flows within
My face grown blind and featureless as heaven.

I would Time were a dew that fades away
And life a veil the hate of God has riven
And this sad house of clay wherein I dwell
Were broken like the earth, -- were spilt as rain.
SAUL.
Ay, there is nothing left but silence now.
A cry went up, the weft of the world was riven -- 
Then silence filled my veins instead of blood.
ATARAH.
My tongue is changed to dust. I fain would weep.
Only mine eyelids withered when Time died.
CHORUS.
O thou art veiled with tears like some sad river.
SAUL.
I would my body were a flame-a flame -- 
That like a falling burning world should cleave
The kindling sky, and then should fall far down
Into the sea of blackness, leaving ashen trails
Of dead sorrow, and disastrous desires
Upon this wretched sphere of petty things,
Of timid fevered thoughts and whining voices.
But God hath spread the earth with reeling night,
With blackness thicker than a wall. Our tears
That fall like silver stars are all the light
He sends us, in our night, and all the sound
He gives, are sobs that rock the earth like waves.
ATARAH.
Bountiful Death, with lips and veins I cry
Come to my breast that I may give you suck.

I had two sons, they clung upon my breast -- 
But oh, they never need my breast-milk now -- 
My breasts will wither for the want of them.
AMASA.
Nay sit a little, warming in the sun.
We have such withered hands that soon grow cold.
They said strange words to us, but we'll forget them.
I bore men too, and then the old grey men,
The old grey hungry men, said one word-war -- 
And wrung my children's bodies dry of blood
And hid them in a hole lest I should kiss them.
We are so old we should be gone -- too old
To die, too weak to creep into the grave,
Two poor old women: for these strong young men
Have taken all the grave-room, and we're left!
ATARAH.
The lips that kissed my sons are changed to dust
They shudder at the sad flame of my breath,
But I've one prayer still left, one prayer, O God!
Seal up her eyes that she may never weep;
Seal up her tongue upon the Judgement Day;
Seal up the earth that she may never crawl
To hide her face from Thee within the grave:
Seal up her breast that she may never feed
Those children of her womb, the worms of death!
SAUL.
Crush down the beat of Time, O mighty God
The pulse of youth, the veins of love and hate,
That I may hear the crying of her soul.
Cry, weep, for there is none to hear you now:

With those lips, red as hell, you burned the world.
The light is dead, for with your long black hair
That twists and writhes like hell's long hissing river
You quenched the light. O you are very pale: -- 
White with the dust of aeons is your face -- 
Things ground to powder by the mills of lust. -- 
And I will sift your dust like whitened ash
From craters of my hate. -- You looked at me ...
My bones were water, and the world lay dead ...
Oh, oh! the vast walls of the world gyrate -- 
Close in -- they'll crush my heart, -- they'll crush my
heart.
ATARAH
My body is broken as the form of night
I gave these light, -- and they have blinded me.
CHORUS.
Our heartstrings were the music of the suns
When their strong youth comes freshened from deep seas.
We were the perfum'd portals of the dawn, -- 
The singing gardens of the Pleiades.
The vineyards of the world, our heavy locks,
When all the fruits of summer shout for joy;
Our eyelids were the chambers of the south,
The gold light drips therefrom like frankincense.
Then madness blew on us, a mighty wind :
The palaces of light are overthrown
And broken lie the rainbows, their great harps,
With burning music muted by the dust.
Our thoughts, strong horses that unfettered ran
Within the golden pastures of the Day;
Then Madness reined them; she has drunk their strength
As summer drains the strongest rivers' pride.
We built new worlds with our immortal kiss,
Then Madness swept like Time across our worlds.
And when we spoke, all space broke into flower,
Till Madness came like winter withering.
And time was but the beat of heart to heart
Till Madness sealed the heart-beat of the world.
Bull-throated now the fires of madness blast.
All space becomes one golden wheel of flame -- 
The agony of endless moons and suns ;
That giant red hole that was the ancient sea
Is fill'd with wreckage of the ruined sky,
The world's vast walls reel blindly, -- then collapse.

Pull down the heavens like a sackcloth pall
To spread upon our faces, sealed with night.
Pull down the sun and burn the fiery moon;
The fabric of the air is torn apart:
The world is dead. There is no world at all.
The light is dead. There shall be no more light.
Pull down the heavens like a sackcloth pall.
Crush down the beat of Time. It was my heart.
ATARAH.
The light is dead. The light is dead -- is dead.

THE PEOPLE'S PALACE
Sacheverell Sitwell

                FOUNTAINS. 

THIS night is pure and clear as thrice refined silver. 
    Silence, the cape of Death, lies heavy 
Round the bare shoulders of the hills. 
Faint throbs and murmurs 
At moments growing to a mutter, then subsiding, 
Fill the night with mystery and panic. 
The honey-tongued arguings of fountains 
Stir the air with flutes and gentle voices. -- 

The graven fountain-masks suffer and weep -- 
Curved with a smile, the poor mouths 
Clutch at a half-remembered song 
Striving to forget the agony of ever laughing, -- 
Laughing while they hear the secrets 
Echoed from the depths of Earth beneath them. 

This half-remembered song -- 
This flow of sad-restrained laughter 
Jars with the jets of youthful water 
Springing from the twisted masks, 
For this is but the birth of water; 

And singing joyfully 
It springs upon the world 
And wanders ceaselessly 
Along its jewelled valleys to the sea, 
Rattling like rolls of drums 
The shells and pebbles down its bed. 

The endless argument of water ceases, 
A few drops fall heavily, splashing on the marble: 
A sultan with his treasures 
Seeking to gain the goodwill of his love, 
Pouring before her chains of crackling pearls 
And weeping heavy jealous tears 
Because she will not heed him. 



                PINDAR.

PINDAR asleep beneath the planes. 
   Then every Zephyr shook his shoulder 
Struck the pale disks 
Sent silver showers beneath the moon 
To clothe his young tired body 
With those pallid leaves. 

And Pan let from his shuttered hive 
The snub-nosed honey-bees escape -- 
A whirr of sound, throb, flutter, 
Feather-flight of birds, 
And on the poet's lips 
The swarm descends to suck his breath. 

Now Pan has learnt his song 
And sings it on the mountains, 
The centaurs gurgling the honeyed waters 
Take hands from lips, retire to caves; 
Each satyr, ev'ry grape-gatherer 
Can hear their panick'd rumblings. 

Now the song lulls; centaurs breathe again -- 
To daylight -- sniff around; then gallop down the hills;  
Beneath the cliffs, poor fishermen 
Hear thunder-thudding of the hooves, and sail for sea. 
They think a hissing thunderbolt will fall about their 
    heads. 

And from the cliffs the centaurs hear 
Flutes like bird-flights through the air 
All regular, then flurry of the wings 
As breath fails in the player -- 
And fevered pluckings at a harp 
Are birds beneath a canopy of leaves 

Who preen their feathers, strike their beaks 
Upon each quill, re-echoing 
With air-born ecstasy. -- 
Could one imprison fire within a pipe of glass 
To catch the surge and shrinkage of its flames, 
I think we'd have in one small pipe 

A man could play on, 
Every plunge through chasms where the winds play, 
Through bell-clear ringing sounds of rain, 
Through painted distances aloof as dreams, 
And every beat their wings make on clouds 
Reverberant as caverns. -- 

And with these flute-sounds came the floundering 
Of horns that play among the waves 
Like porpoises who roll 
Against the stiffened backs of water 
That the waves flap 
When they break sonorously. 

They say that every sound upon the earth 
Is mirrored echoed in the upper air 
And never dies; so when the sound 
The centaurs heard from passing galleys 
Were washing like young tides 
Among the clashing cymbals we call stars -- 

They broke in foam against the songs 
The sirens sang, and the stifled cry 
Of Sappho falling to her death -- 
And still there rose the lyre-strung voice 
Of Pindar fresh, and honey-sweet, 
Rejuvenate in spite of Pan. 



     (He strolls in the garden after dinner.) 

FULL moon-fruit hanging on the orchard tree: 
Wind shakes them -- clash of calabashes 
Full peal of bells -- each fruit 
A honey-hearted rain drop 
Falls pattering on the straight-ribbed leaves. 

I move my eyes then, look around 
Can hear the frost-flowers raise their heads 
In ev'ry dewdrop I have crushed -- 
Far back my sinuous footmarks stretch -- curved snaiL 
walk. 

Then wink my eyes 
Ah! only one moon, and that 
As large and round and heavy as an egg -- 
In branching clouds -- the Phoenix nest it is! 
With half-fledged Phoenix young. 

Their song now swims upon the air 
Like painted ships that plough the sea. 
The wind puffs play among the weeds -- 
Treetops tremble -- temple bells clank in the wind -- 
All flute-sounds in the Phoenix throat. 



           BRIGHTON PIER.

HOW even, flat, and similar 
These strips of plank beneath our feet. 
Unconscious, quite, my weary eyes 
Force me to tread on every joint 
Of plank to plank. 
I seem to lay my road 
Treading flat the boarding as I go, 
And so I ponder, 
Think still further, further, from me. 
Then thump, thump, thump, 
These leaden feet tread on my mind 
And bring me back again. 
Strips of white trouser 
Shooting to and fro 
Jumping forward, jerking back, 
Gay blazers, skirts of flimsy muslin, 
Squirts of sunshine, flopping hats -- 
The planks re-echoing and springing to the footsteps. 
Here, at the water's edge, I stop 
And lean upon the parapet: -- 
There are pierrots dancing in their booth 
Flooded with strong draughts of sunlight; 
They twist and turn beneath the rays 
Like wisps of faint blue smoke. -- 
I cannot hear their song: 
But distant sounds 
Like bubbles breaking 
Reach my ears. -- 
Small waves roll gently forward 
Raise their tired heads 
And slowly break to foam -- 
As sudden as you turn 
A page over in a book. 



          FRAGMENT FROM SIRENS. 

OUR sails were stooping low before the wind -- 
Sails, curved like a shell held to the ear 
That sends far down the listener's soul 
The faint far singing of the sea 
Among its labyrinthine valleys and the hills 
That shew the gilded wreckage of such argosies 
As toss their heads above these sudden mountains 
Raised godlike from the level water-plains, 
And azure-rifted chasms; such ships 
As break their scornful heads 
Against the walls of crumbling foam 
And battlements of far-strung bubbles 
Strewn star-thick o'er the snow-soft sea. 
Our curved prow was steering for the sun 
And lightning-swift we passed across the sea 
Faster, faster, ever faster, faster, 
We flew from speed to speed 
Till looking from the ship 
I saw the jagged foam and tear salt spray -- 
Left hanging in the sea 
Big grapes for which the sea-god 
Would thank our ship, as with his scaled feet 
He crushed the wine from out the bursting fruit. 
For many a mile behind our bird-swift ship 
We left great footmarks in the falling snow 
Of waves, and patches of dire blue 
Restrained the knotted whips of spray 
From striking 'gainst our ship -- 
A striding horse with every nerve 
Strained for utmost speed. 
And so beneath our prow 
The dashing waves were shattered, melted, 
As clouds upon a mountain side 
Sink lower, break asunder, 
Cling lifeless to the rocks 
Then vanish to a wisp of smoke. 
And all the while the red sun drew us down 
A speck of dust within his giant's draught, 
A speck fast falling down the slanting sea, 
Which he had lifted high 
Its musty dregs to drain. 


              OUTSKIRTS.

THE gold voice of the sunset was most clearly in the air 
As I wandered through the outskirts of the town. 

And here disposed upon the grass, I see 
Confetti-thick the amorous couples, -- 
What thoughts, what scenes, evoke, evaporate 
In leaden minds like theirs? 
Can I create them? These things 
Which mean the happiness of multitudes? 
A river bank, grass for a dancing-floor, 
The concertina's wail, and then the darkening day. 

Raise your eyes from ground to trees 
And see them stretch elastically 
Tall and taller, -- then look along 
The banks all frayed of the canal 
Where we are sitting, -- the water 
Lies like a sword 
With marks of rust 
Where the sun has caught it. 

Lie back and listen, 
Watch the reflections. 
You see the ripples run among the leaves, 
Brush them aside, like painted birds 
That sing, within the lattices 
The sun's hot bars make with the branches. 
In China I am told, my dear, 
The temples are outlined with bells 
That swing in the wind, or clash 
Beneath the rain-showers. 
So when these ripples play among the trees 
Or any insect drops upon the water 
The rings and circles spread 
Make the whole trees shiver, 
And far down you hear 
Clash upon clash, the ringing 
Of the bells that jangle with the leaves. 

You cannot pierce those distances? 
Look up! Look up! 
Night is slowly coming to fill the valleys, 
Drench the hills, and free us 
From the suffocation of the sunset. 
On lands all turbulent with heat 
The small white houses dancing 
On the rim of the horizion, -- like aproned children 
In a schoolyard -- are stilled. 
The far-off hills stand solitary 
Made yellow by the sun. 
Beneath them where the river winds 
You hear the spirting of a gramophone -- 
A fountain playing with discoloured water; 
And the strumming of a piano, 
Too far for voice to carry 
Jerks like a mote before our eyes. 
For all the instruments men make 
Play on a public holiday, 
That birdlike we may play upon a reed, 
Or let a nightingale we've made 
Sing among our trees of sentiment, 



               TAHITI.

WHEN the hood of night comes on the land 
My ship is rocked by the sunset wind -- 
Shrill voices from the town 
Cleave the air like darts; 
When they sing in chorus 
It were as if steel arrows of the day, 
The showers of rain, rebounded to the dome of air. 
When one alone shouts loud, his jagged voice 
Blares like a trumpet. Banjos and drums 
Beat, twang, and throb hysterically 
Outside the mud-built huts. 

Far off, the sun, caught spider-like 
In its cloud-web, is seething down the sea 
And churns the waves, spatters them with blood. 
Despairingly it waves red tentacles, clutching 
Fiercely each wool-white wave crest, then splutters out -- 
Ashore, the tall trees flap their foliage, 
Cut out like stage-trees carved in canvas; -- 
The leaves whip the trees as ropes flick the masts 
Of every salt-fed ship. 

Then the hood of night comes lower, and from the shore, 
The Babel grows. 
              -- I dream that I too, sing -- 
Lanterns are lit, -- great stairs of light 
Shake in the water; 
All dank and wet I seem to climb, 
Swaying on soundless gold -- go silently 
Above the land, unto the distant moon, 
Alone, and ringing clear as a bell. 

It is a gong, beaten by the drunkard clouds 
Which reel on the horizon, and by the echoing laughter 
    of the stars. 
 -- Even the sound dies now, and the white bubble, 
Drop of milk, seems to feed 
And love whole worlds, turning gold to silver, 
All ugliness to beauty. 



              BARREL-ORGANS.


RIVER-LIKE, this cold quick wind 
Swirls and eddies down the street. 

In the wide level of the sounding sea 
Sudden pitfalls gape: 
Deep-laid traps for ships, 
Great seething hollows, mirrors for the sky, 
Blue deep chasms flecked with red and gold 
Blown with foam, and live 
With salt-stiff't sails and sailors' bodies, 
Golden treasures and forsaken ships. -- 
And in these hungry seething deeps there lies 
The fleeting wild reflection of the skies. 

So in the steady flow of wind 
That swirls and eddies down the street 
All sense and sight 
All sound and sorrow 
Revolve around us here: -- 
Fly straight as arrows to this spot 
And fall around us. -- 
The jaggeed stones are live with sound, 
And one can hear the shuffling feet on them 
Tread low, monotonous, inevitable -- 
Vast armies marching down the corridors of Time. 
Oh! how this music throbs 
And lifts our bodies from the street! 

Squat chimneys rattle and revolve 
And you can hear 
The weathercocks fly helter-skelter. -- 
Tall drink shops with bedizened fronts 
Decked out with golden letters; 
Inside them voices raised in quarrel 
Seem in an instant to jump nearer 
For the swing-doors with frosted glass 
And bars so thick they seem to guard a treasure 
(Not screen drab ugly drink), 
Fly open with a squirt of yellow light 
Which only shews with emphasis 
The dust and crumbling paper in the gutter. 
A love-sick ballad with a chorus, 
The snarl and tin-tongued tremolo of tenors 
With mellow, even toned basses 
Make the blind and beer-daft beggars 

Stamp their feet and swing their arms in unison, 
So they forget the cold and hungry vigil for a ha'pence. 
The doors swing to, and there is no no more light. 
The darkness throbs around one like the pulse 
Within a frightened animal. 

On either side stretch archways 
Deep like sleep and hopeless as the sea. -- 
A drunkard shuffling his slipshod feet 
Towards his dreary starving home, 
Sings in an even yellow voice: 
Sings of pleasures he has never tasted, 
But sings with full conviction. 
The shop-signs creak and rattle in the wind 
And from far-off a clock strikes (half-heartedly). 
The passage of the hours is uniform; 
They glide together like the tapping of a drum. -- 
Our lives are but as sand within the hour-glass: 
One half is up, the other down. 
So, -- like the ever shifting sea 
Devouring misery eats up 
All the inroads of prosperity -- 
Just as the fangs of seething foam 
Which race and slide o'er the tawny sand 
Are quick withdrawn by the immutable tides. -- 
The moon, young light-haired shepherd 
Has but to lead away his star-fed flocks 
The wool-white foaming breakers of the sea, 
Then pasture them again; -- 
And when he rests behind those thyme-clad hills, the 
   clouds, 
To see the homing stars, striped honey-bees, 
And shuns the sun-god's ravenous embrace, -- 
Without a sight of him, the dragon-writhing foam 
To the gentle piping of his wind-stopped flute 
Draws back again. -- 
                Our lives are short, 
And do we differ but by our degrees of misery. 
We have a solace. -- Listen then: 


THE FEATHERED HAT.

OH! how this music throbs and lifts our feet! 
That day the sky was molten gold, 
The wide fresh-smelling Earth was dancing 
Beneath the glittering sun-shafts. -- 
One side, the street was dark, 
As deep and cool as water-wells, 
The other was ablaze with light: -- 
Great bars, feet thick, shot down 
Between the Sun's hot eyelashes ; 
Motors with their rush and whirr 
Shot into heated glamour, then came 
Black and dull, alternately, 
Between these blazing shafts of heat. 
The organ plays a slow and measured waltz. 
I had my best hat with the feathers in it; 
My boots were thick with dust, 
I held up my skirt and swayed, 
Could not dance, the heat was such. 
I moved so slow, grew tired and more tired, -- 
Could think of nothing. 
             Then of a sudden came the syncopation; 
It seemed to clutch my heart, 
My nerves came strung like banjo-strings -- 
I seemed to twang them with my hands and toes, 
My heavy boots throbbed like catapults a-shooting! -- 

       Reverberate thud of thunder-drops, 
       Shafts and chasms of blinding light 
       Cavalry gallop of falling leaves 
       Crackle and spark of shooting stars. 



               THE MOON.

THE white nightingale is hidden in the branches 
   And heavy leafage of the clouds. 
She pours down her song -- 
Cascades threaded like pearls, 
And the winds, her many-noted flutes 
Flood forth their harmony. -- 
But the Earth turns away 
Swinging in its air and water-rocked cradle. 



               "THE MAYOR OF MURCIA."

SOLILOQUY. 

THE shifting sand lies flat and high 
   As the stand from which an orator 
Sees each human head, a petalled flower 
Turning towards the Sun its benefactor. 
All this I must destroy; 
Beating to a metal disc 
Each feeling flower, to carve it 
To the leer of cunning, clutch of greed, 
Or smile of sacrifice. 
I stand here now: 

This crowd it seems my duty to command 
Is still afar off. Yet the sea 
Is here for me to practice on: 
Each wave a hoary head 
Nigh tumbling from its long bent body; 
Each head with white hair blown by my mouthpiece 
The lean, hard-fingered wind -- 
Grown old because its thirsty hands 
Can never span a shape whose bulk 
Will stop and give it nourishment. 
So the insensate sea strives on; 
And when the far wine-stained breath 
Of the Sun panting after his horses, 
Cools the beard and stops the sea god's conch -- 
Then in fury all the mermen 
Thrash their tails and beat their fins together. 
Always clamour, rattling of pebbles, strife, 
And the greedy gaping of the quicksands. 
Now as the shadow of a frown 
On the face of God 
Is shown by the darkening of a waving cornfield, 
So, as night damps the gilt glory of the Sun 
As he stoops like a husbandman to till the Earth, 
Mighty sweat pouring from under his gorgeous turban 
     of cloud, 
The whole great Earth heaves a sigh 
And all the blossoms of the foam draw in their heads, 
All the harvest of the unfilled sea folds itself to sleep. 

Then from far off the town 
Raises its domes and spires -- they seem 
A troop of elephants with glittering eyes of glass 
And swaying castles on their backs: 
The whole town sways towards me 
Pouring out its people, 
Who gather in the streets, march on: 

Hubbub throb of drums, 
Clangour and thrash of bells, 
And the measured march 
And stamp of feet; -- 
A crash of movement 
On four short notes: 
Gestures of a marionette 
For either arm and both his legs -- 
And trumpet-calls 
Forked and quick as lightning. -- 
            The crowd all gay with colour 
Blown along the road 
Like confetti when a wedding's over. 
Bars of colour, streaks of colour 
And sharp notes like a rapier's thrust. 
And the fevered clanging of the bells 
Rings out still more and more : 
Cataracts, curved blades of steel 
Falling 
       down 
           down 
Through ice cold caverns: 
The clash of shields 
When ship meets ship 
And the fighters leap from boat to boat, 
The sea tossing her blue shoulders 
And the spray running salt unaccustomed tears 
Down every eager face: 

The whole wide Earth trembles and totters 
With the stamp of myriad feet: 
The fret and fury of a mighty army 
Following the foe through a level land. 
Swift as Eagles the Saracen horse 
Fled my army through the sun-scorched sand. 
The furious tramping of horses stirred the desert 
Making the sand ring like a trumpet, 
Echoing the hoots, the howls, the heavy stamp of hooves 
Raising hurricanes of dust to hide the stars, -- 
Wind-riven curtains of sand 
To hide those whirling dancers from our sight. 
My mind now hovers like a vulture 
Seeing down-stretched before him 
Dim valleys filled with memories, 
High peaks enreddened by the sunset fires 
And gloomy depths, clothed black 
Beneath the coverlet of sleep, forgetfulness. 
And now I hover like this vulture 
Swimming 'gainst the star-strewn spaces of the wind: 
Or like a rock stand undismayed 
The peals, the clattering throbs, and splash of foam 
From all this sea of upturned heads 
And bodies all poignant with colour: 
Great waves of sun-touched dyes 
As brilliant, swift, and shrill 
As when the Sun with gorgeous fingers 
Plucks the watery thrill of music 
From the star-high lyre 
That echoes from the clouds 
To touch the Earth all resonant 
With rippling carillons of rain. 
              And now I have to speak, -- 
Explain the objects we're assembled for. 



THE SPEECH. 

"Citizens of Murcia, slaves to these, -- 
By my command you're gathered here. 
I see on every forehead lines of care; 
Each body's bowed and worn with toil. -- 
For many years you've laboured, 
Tilled and reaped your harvests -- 
Golden corn and vine-clusters 
Ripened with the sun's red blood, 
And when the burning hours are dead, 
Refreshed with crystal emanation -- 
Dew from the hidden stores 
Of water in the Earth's black gaping chasms. 
So in the steady pageantry of years 
You've garnered treasures 
Wealth to deck and glorify our town. 
One part 
Of this, our solemn duty 
You've already done. 
Great girdling walls 
Which circle round the town 
Keep off our foes -- a casque of steel 
Upon a warrior's head keeps off all blows 
As lustily as these star-aspiring towers. 
And in the evening the droning bells 
Which call to prayer, re-echo 
From the walls, and peal aloft among the towers, 
As in the forest on a summer's evening 
The tall trees are rudely stirred 
By rush of winged insects 
Intent upon their honeyed business. 
Our walls, then, rise triumphant 
And we can turn our energies to other fields. -- 
The plain here stretches many a mile 
Between the town and tawny mountains; 
The far hills seem battlements 
Of austere hostile towns -- and nearer 
The clouds hang low like beauty-drugged butterflies 
Above the flowering fields. 
Let us girdle the Earth with our handiwork, 
Bind the blue hills with our strength; 
The firmament shall know our might and skill. 
Broad roads shall cross the plains 
Cleave the gold harvest at their will 
And clamp the hills down with their might. 
From the high towers of Murcia 
The roads shall seem like fluttering pennons 
Tied to lances pointing at the stars -- 
For so they seem, when having climbed the hills 
The roads appear to launch into Eternity. -- 
And we will dig canals to bring 
The sea's salt breath into the land 
And heap her shimmering treasures 
On quays deep-laden with the glittering cornsheaves; 
So then with holds replenished 
Our galleons shall sail the seas 
To distant towns afloat above the tawny sands 
Like fleets at anchor -- 
                    And when it's evening 
No sound shall mar the cool canals 
But they shall stretch like weighty drag-nets 
And in each mesh you'll see the moon 
All silver like a draggled scale 
Amid the drying nets." 

Now the thin air was torn with cheers 
And the fiery fountains of the mayor's speech 
Had set afire the gaping listeners;
The swirling smoke of words 
Had blinded every citizen 
To sober hard reality. -- 
Great thoughts, those striding bridges 
Athwart the crystal chasms of our dreams, 
Seemed like accomplished facts 
And on the prancing horses of ambition 
Each conscience leaps the river 
That runs between the thought and fact accomplished. 


THE RETURN.

Look! Here come 
The trumpet 
-ers who stab 
The air 
With stinging 
Blasts from 
Every brazen throat. 

And after them 
   The drummers rolling 
   Of their drums 
   Until they catch an echo 
   From distant dome, blue hill, or whispering tree. 

Think of all the tearing grinding movements irresistible 
   Rattling of rain that splashes 
   From rock hard ground 
   And drips from leaves 
   That shake together -- 
   One vast swing like pealing bells -- 
   And all the rolling of the sea 
   Whipped by the wind's salt lashes --  
   And through this hubbub roar 

The MAYOR 
In his new motor 
Shoots like an arrow; 
While thick darkness lowers on the land. 

And so the winds, giant gods, 
Must hasten home from where 
Above the foam-flecked sea 
They feed their ragged cloud-flocks -- 
And in their haste they loosen from their shoulders 
The heavy baskets filled with fruits 
They have gathered in the day, 
And, careless, drop them by the river 
That runs through Murcia. 
On either side there stand 
The city's clustering domes -- 
Blood-pulsed fruits 
From out these copious baskets 
And fast these fruits now stain the sky, 
With fierce ensanguined hues. 
The while the spires 
Re-echo with the fevered clanging of the bells -- 
Those steel-strong tongues the gods have given them. 

And now I fear 
The moon will give 
A show of sentiment, 
And splash the land 
With her maternal milk, 
Whilst we beneath the walls 
Let pass the dignitaries -- 
And every brick 
This arch is made from 
Is like a honeycomb 
Replete with sound, 
Till, like a sea, 
We hear our voices 
Break above us, 
Then reecho -- 
Small ripples lapping 
The gold shores of all these honey-cells -- 
The bricks above us. 

Bright torches dance like motes 
In the broad moonbeams -- 
And in the tufted trees 
Like wooden toys 
The nightingales begin to creak 
Their laboured song 
Grinding out run by run each spray, 
Till, wings relapsed, 
They stare in vacancy 
And listen to their neighbours. 

THE FESTA.
 
The smoke from our torches 
Hung heavy in the square -- 
An instant's pause -- a slight fatigue -- 
An old man with a white moustache 
Stooped to his bootlace -- 
The first firework flew, 
Rockets fell like falling fruit 
Through the cloud-lattice -- 
Striking the bars at the second bang. 
Chains of light slid on the wind 
Myriad-feathered as the Phoenix 
Flying to its home -- 
Then the searchlights sprang into the air, 
And played point-blank 
Upon the houses -- 
Like fountains lifting 
Attenuated rainbows in the air, 
Carving their crystal bulk to stems, 
Hanging the flowers of water 
Head downwards in the fleecy clouds, 
Thick leaves to guard them, 
Till the fruit downfall 
Like rain upon the roofs. 

And while the beams 
Are playing on the crowd 
You see all secrets -- 
Every soul is bared 
As by a secret window in a room, 
So that the Mayor, who now is on the balcony, 
Might be an insect with its hundred eyes 
Probing the swaying flowers beneath it. 
While below, beyond their heads, 
Black puppets on the end of strings, 
The people dangle on the terraces 
That stretch as taut as tightropes 
All along the cliffs -- 
And here and there they stumble 
Try to keep their balance, 
While, like a nurse's arm 
   The strains of brass bands keep them up; 
   And all the night gesticulates 
   With wooden movements. -- 
In band-stands wreathed with flowers 
The military blare out dance-tunes -- 
The brass roars out over the sea. 
Sibilant strings seem syrup 
Floating in clouds among the tree-tops, 
Keeping the drooping acacias to their stems, 
That drop their distilled dew, 
Made fragrant with the honey of their breath, 
Upon the sheen of darker leaves beneath them 
Where magnolias flaunt their skins 
Whiter than any woman's, 
Or pinker, beneath the prying lights. -- 
   Processions now pour in 
   From every side and quarter -- 
   Music at their head -- 
   People foam at the sides 
   With a fringe of tin trumpets, 
   Throwing flowers, 
   Waving flags, -- 
The churches open wide their doors 
So you can see inside them, 
As into a cake, or the core of a honeycomb. 
The organs boom out loud 
Amid the sugared, marbled splendour, 
As an old priest quite solemn 
Preaching to young girls who laugh at him. 
Waltzes rush through the air like snakes, 
Dances like flopping birds, 
Bands of guitars twang, 
Mandolines send 
Liquid cubes, close knit with sound 
Through the whirl of striving music; 
As you hear the hooves of a galloping horse, 
And then, the blows of the rider. 
The whole town sways 
Pouring out it's people 
Who gather in the streets, march on: 

Hubbub throb of drums, 
Clangour and thrash of bells 
And the measured march 
And stamp of feet: -- 
A crash of movement 
On four short notes: 
Gestures of a marionette 
For either arm and both his legs -- 
And trumpet-calls 
Forked and quick as lightning. -- 
             The crowd all gay with colour 
Blown along the road 
Like confetti when a wedding's over. 
Bars of colour, streaks of colour 
And sharp notes like a rapier's thrust, 
And the fevered clanging of the bells 
Rings out still more and more: 
Cataracts, curved blades of steel 
Falling 
       down 
           down 
Through ice-cold caverns: 
The clash of shields 
When ship meets ship 
And the fighters leap from boat to boat, 
The sea tossing her blue shoulders 
And the spray running salt unaccustomed tears 
Down every eager face, 
The whole wide Earth trembles and totters 
With the stamp of myriad feet. 
The fret and fury of a mighty army 
Following the foe through a level land. 
Swift as eagles the Saracen horse 
Fled my army through the sun-scorched sand. 
The furious trampling of horses stirred the desert 
Making the sand ring like a trumpet, 
Echoing the hoots, the howls, the heavy stamp of 
    hooves 
Raising hurricanes of dust to hide the stars -- 
Wind-riven curtains of sand 
To hide those whirling dancers from our sight. 

                    
THE HOME-COMING.

The houses all are galloping toward me -- 
Gymnasts on the tall trapezes of the wind. 
That dome there!
Like an acrobat tumbling 
From the white bars that the clouds make! 
That broad arch 
Feet wide apart, 
Like any striding giant 
Comes nearer, nearer, 
Leaps right over me. 
The moon sends down fresh floods of milk 
Tall trees seem hands 
Plunged deep into the clouds 
That hang, fat udders, 
Whence the milk flows down. 
Seen against the pattern of broad leaves, 
That the tall trees make, 
The moon might wander in this park 
As free as any animal; 
And when a sudden darkness comes 
Till the beams shine out again -- 
Without a doubt she left her pasture, 
Running in the soft grass, 
Shaking with her horns 
The star-fruit from the sun's gold orchards, 
Where the dew of his breath 
Lies like a soft bloom 
On the red fruit; 
And sure enough you see 
A star dart through the sky 
And fall into the smooth sea. 

A window opens 
And a voice calls out my name 
I stumble on the rough stones, 
Feel for my door. 
A piece of paper in the gutter 
Lies provocative. 
I blow my trumpet at it 
Till it reels into the air 
Floats slowly, turns red, 
Starts spinning, 
Darts like a flame 
Above the housetops. 


          TRUMPETS.

WOVEN from the tangled hair of comets 
On the never-ceasing shuttles of the wind, 
Night, thick Tabernacle for the sun, is pitched; 
And from the deepening gloom 
Ring out the trumpets 
Red and quick as sparks 
Before the vivifying camp-fire of the Gods. 
The blare of a Trumpet is brazen, fierce 
As the culminate charge that decides a battle. -- 
Great plumes like clouds wind-riven 
Float behind each fighter, 
And their armour glints and gleams in the Sun. -- 
The horses hooves beat loud, insistent, -- 
As ominous and dire as kettledrums; 
The whole Earth's expectant. 
And the fields stretch green metallic 
As the leaden plated sky; -- far off 
Small windows, kissed by the Sun's red lips 
Send back a shuddering echo 
To the blare of trumpets. 
The cottage smoke, so stiff and regular 
Goes creaking through the painted air 
And everything is waiting 
Watching in uncertainty. 



THE parrot's voice snaps out -- 
No good to contradict -- 
What he says he'll say again: 
Dry facts, like biscuits, -- 

His voice and vivid colours 
Of his breast and wings 
Are immemoriably old; 
Old dowagers dressed in crimped satin 
Boxed in their rooms 
Like specimens beneath a glass 
Inviolate -- and never changing, 
Their memory of emotions dead; 
The ardour of their summers 
Sprayed like camphor 
On their silken parasols 
Intissued in a cupboard. 
Reflective, but with never a new thought 
The parrot sways upon his ivory perch -- 
Then gravely turns a somersault 
Through rings nailed in the roof -- 
Much as the sun performs his antics 
As he climbs the aerial bridge 
We only see 
Through crystal prisms in a falling rain. 




TRAPEZE-SONG FROM "PERSPECTIVE." 

BENEATH the roof now . . . 
. . . Kick once more the gilded balustrade . . . 
                . . . Now's your time . . . 
And then you'll be among the flowering trees 
That travel with you in the train ; 
Among the trees, and just beneath 
The creaking pulleys that manipulate them 
As rain is managed by the clouds 
That travel with it over sea and land. 

And in your flight diagonal 
Look down upon your audience -- 
Intent upon you, and as you move 
See their direction change, 
White faces sudden blotted out 
Like tears are wiped from eyes -- 
(For an instant while you turn) -- 
Then full upon you once again. 
And as your senses daze 
Convert their movement into sound 
A pendulum for ever beating 
With a fevered interval between the beat -- 
(This, the movement when all heads are turned) -- 
Feel the hot air quiver up your legs and sides 
Surround you quite, like breaking waves 
On sands the sun has warmed. 
Then your pace begins to slacken 
Bird-like you hover 
Long before you light -- 
While, once the danger of your turn is o'er 
The band will start again, 
And gently let you down, 
As in a net ---- 



"WHITSUN." 

HOW hot the bank on which we lie! 
The green paint is melted 
On the seat near by 
So that you cannot touch it! 

Small yellow flowers, glazed white with heat 
That snap like glass when you pick them, 
Grass like a parrot's wing 
Burnt yellow here and there 
By the Sun's hot stare. 

So high this cliff stands from the water 
That the drop itself into the cooler sea 
Makes a faint wind up here -- 
Refreshing like cold water drunk from a spring, 
Or the wafting of far music 
On the bird-wings of a cool wind.
 
The sea sleeps ever 
Under the Sun's hot trumpet, 
While patches of weed float in the water 
To make the surface darker -- 
Where the dying Sun 
Has caught the windows of the town 

You see their glare reflected in the water 
A whorl of quivering sparks 
A crackle in the heart of waves -- 
While catspaws play among the weed 
Till the long strands raised on a wave's back 
Shine like wet hair in the Sun. 

One cloud far out, comes nearer 
Takes my soul back to the gray tunnel 
Of every year's hard work 
Till the young year's holiday, again.

  THE MEMORY OF
  ROBERT ROSS



  "HOW SHALL WE RISE TO GREET THE DAWN?"

  How shall we rise to greet the dawn?
  Not timidly,
  With a hand above our eyes,
  But greet the strong light
  Joyfully;
  Nor will we mistake the dawn
  For the mid-day.

  We must create and fashion a new God--
  A God of power, of beauty, and of strength--
  Created painfully, cruelly,
  Labouring from the revulsion of men's minds.

  It is not that the money-changers
  Ply their trade
  Within the sacred places;
  But that the old God
  Has made the Stock Exchange his Temple.
  We must drive him from it.
  Why should we tinker with clay feet?
  We will fashion
  A perfect unity
  Of precious metals.

  Let us tear the paper moon
  From its empty dome.
  Let us see the world with young eyes.
  Let us harness the waves to make power,
  And in so doing,
  Seek not to spoil their rolling freedom,
  But to endow
  The soiled and straining cities
  With the same splendour of strength.

  We will not be afraid,
  Tho' the golden geese cackle in the Capitol,
  In fear
  That their eggs may be placed
  In an incubator.
  Continually they cackle thus--
  These venerable birds--
  Crying, "Those whom the Gods love
  Die young,"
  Or something of that sort.
  But we will see that they live
  And prosper.

  Let us prune the tree of language
  Of its dead fruit.
  Let us melt up the clichés
  Into molten metal;
  Fashion weapons that will scald and flay;
  Let us curb this eternal humour
  And become witty.

  Let us dig up the dragon's teeth
  From this fertile soil;
  Swiftly,
  Before they fructify;
  Let us give them as medicine
  To the writhing monster itself.

  We must create and fashion a new God--
  A God of power, of beauty, and of strength;
  Created painfully, cruelly,
  Labouring from the revulsion of men's minds.
  Cast down the idols of a thousand years,
  Crush them to dust
  Beneath the dancing rhythm of our feet.
  Oh! let us dance upon the weak and cruel:
  We must create and fashion a new God.

  PART I

  PRELUDE

  We have wandered through the dim valleys of sleep
  --That lie so still and far--
  Have bathed in the lakes of silence,
  Where each star
  Shines brighter than its own reflection in the heavens;
  Where, diving deep,
  My soul has sought to catch and keep
  The silver feathers of the moon
  That float like down upon the waters,
  In whose pale rest
  We find
  Forgetfulness of death
  That comes so soon
  --Waters that lull the mind
  With some sweet breath
  Of wind, of flowers,
  With summer showers of rain,
  Or quicken it with recreative pain.

  We have fled further from this leaden cage,
  Seeking those rainbow forests,
  Where the light
  Thrills through you, shaking, fainting, with delight;
  Where sway tall luminous trees
  Wind-swept in one vast flashing harmony,
  That like a wave
  Splashes its seething sound
  And then envelops you.

  We have strayed to other places,
  Courts of fear,
  That stretch like echoes through the endless dusk
  Drenched with dead memories;
  Like musk
  They cling about you
  In a heavy cloud.
  Each shadow-sound we hear
  Clutches the heart.
  With fevered hands we tear
  The terror-pulsing walls
  --Fight our way out
  --Out
  Into other Courts
  As vague and full of fear.
  And we have found the proud and distant palaces of night.




  THE SILENCE OF GOD

  One night upon the southern sea
  In helpless calm we lay,
  Waiting for day,
        Waiting for day.

  As goldripe fruit fall from a tree
  A comet fell; no other sight,
  But in the ocean tracks of light
  Trembled--then passed away,
        Away.

  No sound broke on our waiting ears,
  Though instinct whispered wayward fears
  Of things we cannot tell--
        Of things the sea could tell.

  No wisp of wind, no watery sound
  Reached us; as if high on the ground
  We stayed.  A sense of fever fell
  Upon each mind,
        Each soul and mind.

  Until our eyes, that ever sought
  The cloying empty darkness, find
  Another shape--or is it wrought
  Of terror?--on the deep
        The endless deep.

  All dark it lay.  No light shone out;
  And though we cried across, no shout
  Came back to us.  As if in sleep
  The black bulk lay so still,
        So still.

  No sign came back; no answering cry
  Cleft the immense monotony
  That swathed us like a funeral pall,
  In folds of menace; almost shrill
  The silence seemed,
        And we so small.

  Swiftly a boat was lowered down;
  The rowlocks creaked; our track shone white
  Behind us like God's frown,
        God's frown.

  We clambered up that great ship's height;
  There was no light; there was no sound;
  Nor was there any being found
  Upon that ship,
        That ship.

  We groped our way along.  God knows
  How long the rats had been alone
  With dust and rust!  Yet flight was shown
  To have been instant, in the grip
  Of some force stronger than its foes
        --Its human foes.

  * * * * *

  Then sudden from the dark there thrilled
  The distant dying of a song
  That hung like haze upon the sea, and filled
  Each soul with joy and terror strong,
        With joy and terror strong.

  Upon the sombre air were spent
  These notes, as from a hidden place
  Where all time and all love lay pent
  In lingering embrace--
        In lingering embrace.

  Deep in our hearts we felt the call;
  We knew that if our fate should send
  That song again, we must leave all
  And follow to the end,
        The end.




  ADVENTURE

  Down through the torrid seas we swept,
  Sails curved like bows about to shoot.
  As an arrow speeds through the air
  Our ship parted the clinging waters.

  Then, out of the ocean
  Blossomed a distant land.

  * * * * *

  The air quivered,
  Dancing above it
  In a frenzy of passion.
  Waves of heat trembled towards us
  Across the cool lassitude of the ocean.
  They rolled new odours at us,
  Sounding the chords of hidden senses,
  Till we were alert
  With minds as sensitive and taut
  As resined strings.
  The sea itself
  Crouched down behind us,
  Urging us on,
  Driving us on,
  To unknown
  Perilous adventures.

  * * * * *

  Ships and sea were forgotten.
  We trampled
  And stumbled
  On, on,
  Through the burning sand
  To the hot shroud of the squat threatening forest,
  Where, as you walked,
  You tore apart
  A solid sheet of air.

  Brown satyrs grimaced at us,
  Swinging with long hairy arms
  From crooked branch to crooked branch.
  The sun
  Was at its height.
  Rays pierced the hot shade;
  White lines of light
  Shot through the shadows
  To where a point of green
  Shuddered with dangerous movement,
  Throbbed and hummed with the whirr of insects.
  Birds more bright than any streamers from the sun
  Cleft the air
  Like hammers;
  Scintillating wings
  Tossed patches of colour
  Into the dark shimmering air.
  Shrill calls
  Whistled like knives
  Hurled through the empty heat.

  Frantic chattering rose up.
  Through the honeycombed darkness
  Slim animals
  --Their hides splashed with false sunlight--
  Quivered away
  Into the hollow distance.
  Or clattered past us,
  Cloven hooves
  Kicking at the hard, bent trunks
  Of gnarled trees.
  Large hairy fruits of wood
  Were cast at us,
  Snarlingly,
  From the darkness.
  Faces
  --Faces peered down
  From the interwoven boughs.

  Hastily we stumbled on;
  Hurriedly we stumbled back,
  Bewildered.
  Small tracks
  Tripped through the blackness
  Hither and thither;
  Twigs crawled from under our feet,
  Hissing away
  In venom
  --And we were bewildered.

  Then suddenly
  We felt,
  Rumbling in curling patterns through the ground,
  The beating of drums.
  As winds bellow into caves,
  As waves swirl and curl into hollows,
  We heard the blowing of wooden trumpets
  And of pipes.

  Soon,
  Under the western canopy of the sun,
  Where the fevered hills lay huddled together,
  We saw great gourd-shaped palaces
  Loom up like mountains.
  Figures played on trumpets,
  Twisted like snakes,
  Or on the curved, carved horns of unknown beasts.
  In the sound was mirrored
  The panic seizures of the night,
  --The fear of things that walk in darkness.
  The drums were painted
  In hot colours
  That, even through the dusk,
  Glowed torture and writhing torment.
  Like a shower of molten lead
  The din fell down upon us
  From the Palaces.

  Bare yellow women
  Hurried
  To greet us;
  Their heels swayed inward
  As they walked.
  They offered fruits
  --Fruits that were strange to us;
  Mellow they were, and with a scent
  Of sun, of summer,
  And of woodland nights.
  We ate
  --And dreams closed round.

  * * * * *




  DUSK

  Night like a hawk
  Swooped down
  On to the phoenix bird,
  --Tore out its flaming feathers.
  Solitary plumes
  Flared down into the darkness,
  Floating above the distant sea.
  Stillness and heat clung together;
  And the hawk
  Spread out her wings.

  Gigantic pinions
  Flutter the air above,
  Fanning our faces
  And
  We sing.....




  SAILOR-SONG

  On swinging seas our ship has flown
  --In sun and shadow lands alit.
  We saw the sack of Carthage Town
  (And Dido building it).

  Cassandra, direful prophetess,
  We heard foretell the fate of Troy,
  And through its streets helped wheel and press
  That wooden, painted toy.

  We've seen events aboard this hulk
  Of grave import and mystery
  --The serpent's writhing horrid bulk
  Go seething through the sea.

  Then once we left Atlantis Town.
  Behind us like a lily flower
  It blossomed; but then down, far down,
  Sank every vane and tower.

  Now you can hear the clanging beat
  Of bells beneath the furious foam.
  In coral palaces the great
  Sea monsters make their home.

  Their corridors with pearl are pav'd;
  Float down them in an endless flight
  Fierce finny beasts.  The walls are laved
  In irridescent light.

  We brought gifts--myrrh and frankincense--
  From Khubla to the Great Moghul;
  Espied the Juggernaut immense
  Pound over flesh and skull;

  Saw desert-men atone for ills
  With frenzied hands, with wounds that gape,
  --The hermits hidden in the hills
  --The Herod in his Tyrian Cape.

  From out our ship, held fast by gale,
  We watched Andromeda's release;
  Beheld the galleon in full sail
  That flew the Golden Fleece.

  Icarus, proud of his new power,
  We saw stretch out his wings to fly.
  We heard in that tremendous hour
  The cry from Calvary.

  Thus many things we understand
  That puzzle landsmen: we can tell
  Of perils in each time and land;
  But outside Heaven or Hell

  No fruit so strange we tasted save
  But one; none cast so strange a spell
  Except the fruit the first Eve gave
  To the first man who fell.




  THE DANCE

  The song ends.
  The rocking earth
  Plunges madly
  --Lunges like a man
  About to fight.
  Trees roll beckoning branches at us,
  Branches that swing and sway.
  From the forest
  The animals
  Howl
  Like laughter.
  With their burning scimiters
  Flames slice the night.

  Monotony,
  A life preserved in ocean salt,
  Scales off our limbs.
  Within our veins
  The liquor of this fruit-of-fire
  Mounts in splendour inexhaustible.
  The world itself
  Dances
  To make us dance
  In cosmic frenzy.




  WHY SHOULD A SAILOR RIDE THE SEA?

  Why should a sailor ride the sea,
  When he can drink and dance and sing,
  Or watch the stars out-blossoming
  Upon the tree of night?

  Why should he face the tear-salt waves,
  When he can sing, or feast on fruit,
  Dance to the silver-sobbing lute,
  And all men seem his slaves?

  No more to ship or sea we'll go,
  To watch the land sink out of sight
  Suffused by purple fumes of night,
  Each heart weighed down with woe.

  But under rustling fretted lace
  Of leaves, we'll dance and stamp our feet
  In frenzy, to the furious beat,
  --The rhythm of all space.

  Or watch each dappled fawn and elf
  Spring from the green lairs where they hide;
  Now every soul is multiplied
  And communes with itself.

  The softly sailing moon is now
  A pendulum, hung in a vast
  Blue bubble--so to mark our fast
  Lithe movements to and fro.

  Down from the sky the willing stars
  Fall round each brow a crown to form;
  Till feet and limbs, a rushing storm,
  Dance whirling on in ecstasy.


  The earth dances;
  The earth dances;
  Trees charge at us
  Like horsemen;
  Forests swoop
  Down the hill,
  Charging at us,
  But we are brave,
  Full of a fiery courage,
  And go onward
  Onward,
  Through the galloping trees.
  We shout
  Glowing phrases
  --Snatches of ineffable wit.

  The frenzy in our feet
  Must surely set the world afire.
  Yet still the stars
  Rain down their golden tremors of delight,
  And the moon
  Sweeps like a bird
  Through the arch of space.

  We, too,
  Float downward
  Gently
  To soft shipwreck.
  We, too,
  Are of the kindred of the Pleiades;
  Reel on our golden path
  Down,
  Down,
  Through the curved emptiness of the heavens.




  PART II



  CORNUCOPIA

  Now music fills the night with moving shades;
  Its velvet darkness, veined like a grape,
  Obscures and falls round many a subtle shape
  --Figures that steal through cool tall colonnades,
  Vast minotaurian corridors of sleep;
  Rhythmic they pass us, splashed by red cascades
  Of wine, fierce-flashing fountains whose proud waves
  Shimmer awhile; plunge foaming over steep
  Age-polished rocks, into the dim cold caves
  Of starlit dusk below--then merge with night,
  Softly as children sinking into sleep.

  But now more figures sway into our sight;
  Strong and bare-shouldered, pressed and laden down,
  Stagger across the terraces.  They bear
  Great Cornucopia of summer fruit
  And heavy roses scented with the noon
  --Piled up with fruit and blossoms, all full blown,
  Crimson, or golden as the harvest moon--
  Piled up and overflowing in a flood
  Of riches; brilliant-plumaged birds, that sing
  As the faint playing on a far sweet lute,
  Warble their tales of conquest and of love;
  Perch on each shoulder; sweep each rainbow wing
  Like light'ning through the breathless dark above.
  Heaped up in vases gems shine hard and bright;
  Sudden they flare out--gleaming red like blood--
  For now the darkness turns to swelling light,
  Great torches gild each shadow, tear the sky,
  As drums tear through the silence of the night;
  Breaking its crystal quiet--making us cry
  Or catch our sobbing breath in sudden fear.
  A shadow stumbles, and the jewels shower
  On to the pavers with a sharp sweet sound.
  They mingle with the fountain drops that flower
  Up in a scarlet bloom above the ground,
  A beauteous changing blossom; then they rain
  On to the broad mysterious terraces,
  Where sea-gods rise to watch in cold disdain
  Before those vast vermillion palaces,
  --Watch where the slumbering coral gods of noon,
  Drunk with the sudden golden light and flare
  Of flaming torches, try to pluck and tear
  That wan enchanted lotus flower, the moon,
  Down from its calm still waters; thus they fall,
  Like flowing plumes, the fountains of our festival.

  Slowly the torches die.  They echo long,
  These last notes of a Bacchanalian song,
  Of drifting drowsy beauty, born of sleep,
  --Vast as the sea, as changing and as deep.
  In thanksgiving for shelt'ring summer skies
  Still, far away, a fervent red light glows.
  Small winds brush past against our lips and eyes,
  Caress them like a laughing summer rose,
  And rainbow moths flit by, in circling flight.
  A harp sobs out its crystal syruppings;
  Faintly it sounds, as the poor petal-wings,
  Fragile yet radiant, of a butterfly
  Beating against the barriers of night.

  Then from the Ocean came the Syren song,
  Heavy with perfume, yet faint as a sigh,
  Kissing our minds, and changing right from wrong;
  Chaining our limbs; making our bodies seem
  Inert and spellbound, dead as in a dream.

  * * * * *

  Bound by the silver fetters of your voice
  To this new slavery of dreams,
  We, listening, rejoice.
  The magic strains
  Swell in this darkness star-devoid.
  The music streams
  Upon the world in patterns passionate yet clear,
  And stains
  Each soul.  The mind, decoyed
  By thoughts that grind and tear
  Away old values,
  Is sent down other thoughts
  So subtly swift,
  That in their fleeting passage
  They can cut adrift our souls
  Upon a sea of wonder and of fear.
  Within the arid minds of men
  This music sounds but once, for then
  They hear no other song.
  In it, tumultuous rush of wings,
  The glamour of old lovely things
  In deserts buried long,
  The grace of beasts that bound and leap
  With movements blithe and strong
  --Of those that creep
  Away in hissing-reptile rage--
  All these, all these are found.
  They hear
  The secrets, solved, of each dead age,
  Each mystery is clear.
  For in this music's flow, the din
  Of spheres that tear and speed and spin
  Through pulsing space is heard,
  And all things men have loved and feared
  Are mirror'd in each sound.




  SONG

  Our hidden voices, wreathed with love's soft flowers,
  Wind-toss'd thro' valleys, tremble across seas
  To turbann'd cities; touch tall lonely towers,
  Call to you thro' the sky, the wind, the trees.

  Misted and golden as the hanging moon,
  That like a summer fruit floats from the sky,
  Thrills out our distant age-enchanted tune,
  --Nor will it let you pass our beauty by.
  But if it should not reach to stir your mind,
  Then hold a summer rose against the ear,
  Till through its crimson sweetness you can hear
  The falling flow of rhythm--so designed
  That from this secret island, like a star
  Shining above a shrouded world, our song
  Cleaves through the darkest night and echoes long,
  Bidding you follow whether near or far.
  Come hither where the mermaids churn the foam,
  Lashing their tails across the calm, or dive
  To groves and gardens of bright flowers; then roam
  Beneath the shade of stone-branched trees, or drive
  Some slow sea-monster to its musselled home.
  Here, as a ladder, they climb up and down
  The rainbow's steep refracted steps of light,
  Till, when the dusk sends down its rippling frown,
  They quiver back to us in silver flight.
  The moon sails down once more; our mermaids bring
  Rich gifts of ocean fruit.  Again we sing.
  Enchantment, love, vague fear, and memories
  That cling about us like the fumes of wine
  With myriad love-enhancing mysteries
  We pour out in one song--intense--divine,
  Down the deep moonlit chasms of the waves
  Our song floats on the opiate breeze.  Why seek
  To goad your carven galleys, fast-bound slaves
  Who search each sweeping line of bay and creek,
  Only to stagger on a hidden rock, or find
  The limp dead sails swept off by sudden wind?
  Thus always you must search the cruel sea,
  For if you find us mankind shall be free!

  But when you sleep we grasp you by the hand,
  And to the trickling honey of the flute
  We lead you to a distant shimmering land
  Where lotus-eaters munch their golden fruit,
  Then fall upon the fields of summer flowers
  In drunken sunlit slumber, while a fawn
  Prances and dances round them.
                              Oh, those hours
  When through the crystal valleys of the dawn
  Down from the haunted forests of the night
  There dash the dew-drenched centaurs on their way,
  Mad with the sudden rush of golden light
  --Affright the lotus-eaters, as they sway
  Towards the woodlands in a stumbling flight.
  In these deep groves we follow through the cool
  Shadow of high columnar trees, to find
  The fallen sky within a forest pool
  That's faintly veiled and fretted by a wind,
  Lest our white flashing limbs should turn you blind.

  * * * * *

  As the sweet sound of bells that fall and fade
  In watery circles on the verge of night,
  So rounded ripples spread beneath the shade
  Of flowing branches dripping with green light.

  Thus do we wander; but when day is spent
  We grope our way thro' vast tall palaces,
  Palaces sinister and somnolent,
  Where lurk dim fears and unknown menaces.

  These high pale walls and this pale shining floor
  Seem built of bones, by ages planed and ground
  To a white smoothness.
                On this rock-bound shore
  The bodies of dead sailors oft are found.

  These sombre arches pierce the sullen sky.

  These pillars are the pillars of the night.

  Of what avail your strife and agony?
  Why seek to search and struggle for the light?
  Our music chains you: binds your limbs from flight.




  PROSPECT ROAD

  Gigantic houses, tattered by all time,
  Raise their immense and ruined bulk and height
  In one unending universal street,
  Against a strange and sunken yellow sky
  --Like sunset trickling through into the sea,
  Down to the depths--yellow and grey and green.
  Blind windows face the interminable road;
  Innumerable those windows seem to stretch
  All smeared and stained and stamped with time and blood,
  --Stains that seem faces--horrid twitching masks
  Moving their lewd derisive lips and tongues,
  Spitting out treacheries with vampire lips--
  Or eyes that gaze from far blank-stretching walls
  --The tortured eyes of those who see their death
  Approaching æon-by-æon along this road.
  Behind the walls sound voices whispering
  Of dire and hidden, carefully hidden, thoughts--
  Cruel, wicked and unfathomable things
  That lie behind this infamy of stone.
  Then clamour, shrieking voices, or a pause
  That falls like lead through the suspended air;
  Broken by laughter--rending piercing sounds
  That seem to tear the fabric of our minds.
  Slinking along these wicked, stricken walls,
  I reached a shining distant point of light.
  And glory came--vast and unending light,
  Rays--flashing, writhing rays of light.
  And then the music sounded.  Ah, that sound!

  Cadences rose and fell unendingly--
  Quivering, shining waves of sound and sight--
  Sounds of the universe--the cries of space
  And planets tumbling wildly round our world
  --Showing the meaning of the meaningless.
  "God and eternity"--strange flashing sounds
  The whirl of time, "Melchisedec"--"Glory of God"
  And space--the universe--like framing words--
  "Gog and Magog"--"Infinity"--the rush of waters
  And the sky comes down.
                      Down with the splintering stars.

  WAR-HORSES

  How they come out
  --These Septuagenarian Butterflies--
  After resting
  For four years!

  Surely they are more spirited
  Than ever?
  Their enamelled wings
  Are rusty with waiting
  --Their eyelids
  Sag a little
  Like those of a bloodhound;
  But they swim gaily into the limelight.

  Oh, these war-horses!
  They have seen it through.
  Theirs has been a splendid part!
  The waiting--the weariness!
  For the Queens of Sheba
  Are used to courts and feasting;
  But for four years
  Platitudes have remained
  Uncoined,
  For there have been few parties
  And only
  Three stout meals
  A day.

  But now
  They have come out.
  They have preened
  And dried themselves
  After their blood-bath.
  Old men seem a little younger,
  And tortoise-shell combs
  Are longer than ever;
  Earrings weigh down aged ears;
  And Golconda has given them of its best.

  They have seen it through!
  Theirs is the triumph,
  And, beneath
  The carved smile of the Mona Lisa
  False teeth,
  Rattle
  Like machine guns,
  In anticipation
  Of food and platitudes.

  CHURCH-PARADE

  The flattened sea is harsh and blue--
  Lies stiff beneath--one tone, one hue,
  While concertina waves unfold
  The painted shimmering sands of gold.

  Each bird that whirls and wheels on high
  Must strangle, stifle in, its cry,

  For nothing that's of Nature born
  Should seem so on the Sabbath morn.

  The terrace glitters hard and white,
  Bedaubed and flecked with points of light

  That flicker at the passers-by--
  Reproachful as a curate's eye.

  And china flowers, in steel-bound beds,
  Flare out in blues and flaming reds;

  Each blossom, rich and opulent,
  Stands like a soldier; and its scent

  Is turned to camphor in the air.
  No breath of wind would ever dare

  To make the trees' plump branches sway,
  Whose thick green leaves hang down to pray.

  The stiff, tall churches vomit out
  Their rustling masses of devout,

  Tall churches whose stained Gothic night
  Refuses to receive the light!

  Watch how the stately walk along
  Toward the terrace, join the throng

  That paces carefully up and down
  Above a cut-out cardboard town!

  With prayer-book rigid in each hand,
  They look below at sea and sand.

  The round contentment in their eyes
  Betrays their favourite fond surmise,

  That all successful at a trade
  Shall tread an eternal Church-Parade,

  And every soul that's sleek and fat
  Shall gain a heavenly top-hat.

  From out the Church's Gothic night,
  Past beds of blossoms china-bright,
  Beneath the green trees' porous shade,
  We watch the sea-side Church-Parade.




  AT THE HOUSE OF MRS. KINFOOT

  At the house of Mrs. Kinfoot
  Are collected
  Men and women
  Of all ages.
  They are supposed
  To sing, paint, or to play the piano.
  In the drawing-room
  The fireplace is set
  With green tiles
  Of an acanthus pattern.
  The black curls of Mrs. Kinfoot
  Are symmetrical.
  --Descended, it is said,
  From the Kings of Ethiopia--
  But the British bourgeoisie has triumphed.
  Mr. Kinfoot is bald
  And talks
  In front of the fireplace
  With his head on one side,
  And his right hand
  In his pocket.
  The joy of catching tame elephants,
  And finding them to be white ones,
  Still gleams from the jungle-eyes
  Of Mrs. Kinfoot,
  But her mind is no jungle
  Of Ethiopia,
  But a sound British meadow.

  Listen then to the gospel of Mrs. Kinfoot:
  "The world was made for the British bourgeoisie,
  They are its Swiss Family Robinson;
  The world is not what it was.
  We cannot understand all this unrest!

  Adam and Eve were born to evening dress
  In the southern confines
  Of Belgravia.
  Eve was very artistic, and all that,
  And felt the fall
  Quite dreadfully.
  Cain was such a man of the world
  And belonged to every club in London;
  His father simply adored him,
  --But had never really liked Abel,
  Who was rather a milk-sop.
  Nothing exists which the British bourgeoisie
  Does not understand;
  Therefore there is no death
  --And, of course, no life.

  The British bourgeoisie
  Is not born,
  And does not die,
  But, if it is ill,
  It has a frightened look in its eyes.

  The War was splendid, wasn't it?
  Oh yes, splendid, splendid."

  Mrs. Kinfoot is a dear,
  And so artistic.




  GREEN-FLY

  I.

  Like ninepins houses stand up square
    In lines; their windows mouths to bite
  At servants, who lean out to stare
    At anything that moves in sight.

  Where once was green-limbed tree or ledge
    Of greener moss or flowery lane,
  Set back behind a private hedge
    Each house repeats itself again.

  Each house repeats itself again,
    But smaller still and yet more dry;
  For--just as those who live within--
    So have these houses progeny.

  Throughout each dusty endless year,
    Whose days seem merely wet or fine,
  These children constantly appear
    In an unending dusty line.

  As, on a rose that is ill-grown
    Nature, insulted and defied,
  Showers down a blight, so sends she down
    On houses, those who live inside.


  II.

  Within each high, well-papered room,
    Compressed, all darkness lay,
  Darkness of night, and crypt, and tomb,
    Nor ever entered day.

  But through the endless black there crept,
    With groping hand and groping thought,
  With eyes that blinked, but never wept,
    And minds that fell, but never fought,

  The wonderless, the hard, the nice,
    Who scurry at a ray of light,
  Then, like a flock of frightened mice,
    Career back into night.

  From out this damning dreadful dark
    (While history, thundering, rolls by)
  They wait for an anæmic lark
    To sing from weak blue sky.

  Or if a dog is hurt, why then
    They see the evil, and they cry.
  But yet they watch ten million men
    Go out to end in agony!

  Their own strange God they have set up,
    Of clay, of iron, and mothéd hide;
  Whose eyes, each convex as a cup,
    Reflect the herd endeified.

  Their twisted feet in boots He made
    To walk the narrow asphalt way,
  And gave each room a curtain's shade
    To muffle out the light of day.

  For this God understands their need;
    Created lids for each pale eye;
  He sculped each mouth to say "Agreed,"
    And gives them coffins if they die.

  When, if for punishment they go
    To other lands, why, it should be
  The judgment that, down there below,
    They see this world as they might see!

  A world of contrast, shade and light--
    Clashing romance and cruelty,
  But stricken with the dreadful blight
    Of fear to feel and fear to cry.

  Where for a moment lives are filled
    With love or hate--where born of pain
  The children grow up--to be killed!
    Where freedom--dead--is born again.

  Wherein life's pattern crude and shrill
    Is weft by neither foe nor friend,
  But by some rough colossal will
    Towards some vast invisible end.

  But in those houses dark there creep,
    With bodies wrapt in woollen dress,
  With eyes that blink but never weep,
    The sentimental wonderless!




  DE LUXE

  I.

  HYMN.

  Above from plaster-mountains,
    Wine-shadowed by the sea,
  Spurt white-wool clouds, as fountains
    Whirl from a rockery.

  These clouds were surely given
    To keep the hills from harm,
  For when a cloud is riven
    The fatted rain falls warm.

  Through porous leaves the sun drops
    Each dripping stalactite
  Of green.  The chiselled tree-tops
    Seem cut from malachite.

  Stiff leaves with ragged edges
    (Each one a wooden sword)
  Are carved to prickly hedges,
    On which, with one accord,

  Their clock-work songs of calf-love
    Stout birds stop to recite,
  From cages which the sun wove
    Of shade and latticed light.

  Each brittle booth and joy-store
    Shines brightly.  Below these
  The ocean at a toy shore
    Yaps like a Pekinese.


  II.

  NURSERY RHYME.

  The dusky king of Malabar
  Is chief of Eastern Potentates;
  Yet he wears no clothes except
  The jewels that decency dictates.

  A thousand Malabaric wives
  Roam beneath green-tufted palms;
  Revel in the vileness
  That Bishop Heber psalms.

  From honey-combs of light and shade
  They stop to watch black bodies dart
  Into the sea to search for pearls.
  By means of diabolic art

  Magicians keep the sharks away;
  Mutter, utter, each dark spell,
  So that if a thief should steal,
  One more black would go to Hell.

  But Mrs. Freudenthal, in furs,
  From brioche dreams to mild surprise
  Awakes; the music throbs and purrs.
  The cellist, with albino eyes,

  Rivets attention; is, in fact,
  The very climax; pink eyes flash
  Whenever nervous and pain-racked
  He hears the drums and cymbols clash.

  Mrs. Freudenthal day-dreams
  --Ice-spoon half-way to her nose--
  Till the girl in ochre screams,
  Hits out at the girl in rose.

  This is not at all the way
  To act in large and smart hotels;
  Angrily the couples sway,
  Eagerly the riot swells.

  Girls who cannot act with grace
  Should learn behaviour; stay at home;
  A convent is the proper place.
  Why not join the Church of Rome?

  A waiter nearly drops the tray
  --Twenty tea-cups in one hand.
  Now the band joins in the fray,
  Fighting for the Promised Land.

  Mrs. Freudenthal resents
  The scene; and slowly rustles out,
  But the orchestra relents,
  Waking from its fever bout.




  BOOK III

  PROMENADES




  NOCTURNE

  The valleys that were known in sunlit hours
  Are vast and vague as seas;
  Wan as the blackthorn flowers
  That quiver in the first spring-scented breeze:
  Far as the frosted hollows of the moon.
  The sighing woods are still--
  Wrapp'd in their age-long boon
  Of mystery and sleep.  A naked hill,
  Loud and discordant, looms against the sky,
  And little lights like stars
  Break the monotony
  Of blue and silver, black and grey.  Strange bars
  Of light resemble silver masks, and leer
  Across the forest lane.
  Tall nettles, rank from rain,
  Scent all the woods with some ancestral fear.

  Trees rustle by the water.  A voice sings
  Faintly, to ward off fright.

  The water breathes pale rings
  Of sad, wan light;
  Faintly they grow,
  Then merge into the night:
  The last poor twisted echo takes to flight.




  _To_ W. H. DAVIES.


  THE LAMENT OF THE MOLE-CATCHER

  An old, sad man who catches moles
    Went lonely down the lane--
  All lily-green were the lanes and knolls,
    But sorrow numbed his brain.
  He paid no heed to flower or weed
    As he went his lonely way.
  No note he heard from any bird
    That sang, that sad spring day.

  "I trap'd the moles for forty years
    Who could not see the sky,
  I reckoned not blind blood or tears,
    And the Lord has seen them die.
  For forty years I've sought to slay
    The small, the dumb, the blind,
  But now the Lord has made me pay,
    And I am like their kind.
  I cannot see or lane or hill,
    Or flower or bird or moon;
  Lest life shall lay me lower still,
    O Lord--come take it soon."




  THE BEGINNING

  Great spheres of fire, to which the sun is nought,
  Pass thund'ring round our world.  A golden mist--
  The margin to the universe--falls round
  The verges of our vision.  Rocks ablaze
  Leap upward to the sun, or fall beneath
  The rush of our rapidity, that seems
  Catastrophy, and not the joyous birth
  Of yet another star.  The air is full
  Of clashing colour, full of sights and sounds
  Too plain and loud for men to heed or hear,
  The cosmic cries of pain that follow birth:
  A multi-coloured world.
                          The scorching heat
  Surpasses all the equatorial days:
  Steam rises from the surface of the sea.
  Gigantic rainbow mists resemble forms
  That bring to mind strange elemental sprites
  Exulting in the chaos of creation.
  They glide above the tumult-ridden sea
  Which now is shaken as are autumn leaves;
  Great hollows open and reveal its depths--
  Devoid of any form of life or death.
  Till wave on wave it gathers strength again
  And shakes a mountain, splits it to the base
  (Still weak from struggle as a new-born babe).
  Then night comes on, and shows the flaming path
  Of all the rocks that vainly seek the sun.
  Broad as the arch of space, a myriad moons
  Sail slowly by the sea; the glowing world
  Shows up the pallor of their ivory.
  The din grows greater from the universe:
  There rises up the smell of fire and iron,--
  Not dreary like the smell of burnt-out things,
  But like the smell of some gigantic forge--
  Cheerful, of good intent, and full of life.

  Now all the joyous cries of sea and earth,
  The universal harmonies of birth,
  Rise up to haunt the slumber of their God.




  THE END

  Round the great ruins crawl those things of slime
  Green ruins lichenous and scarred by moss--
  An evil lichen that proclaims world doom,
  Like blood dried brown upon a dead man's face.
  And nothing moves save those monstrosities,
  Armoured and grey, and of a monster size.

  But now, a thing passed through the cloying air
  With flap and clatter of its scaly wings--
  As if the whole world echoed from some storm.
  One scarce could see it in the dim green light
  Till suddenly it swooped and made a dart
  And brushed away one of those things of slime,
  Just as a hawk might sweep upon its prey.

  It seems as if the light grows dimmer yet--
  No radiance from the dreadful green above,
  Only a lustrous light or iridescence
  As if from off a carrion-fly,--surrounds
  That vegetation which is never touched
  By any breeze.  The air is thick, and brings
  The tainted subtle sweetness of decay.
  Where, yonder, lies the noisome river-course,
  There shows a faintly phosphorescent glow.

  Long writhing bodies fall and twist and rise,
  And one can hear them playing in the mud.
  Upon the ruined walls there gleam and shine
  The track of those grey vast monstrosities--
  As some gigantic snail had crawled along.

  All round the shining bushes waver lines
  Suggesting shadows, slight and grey, but full
  Of that which makes one nigh to dead with fear.

  Watch how those awful shadows culminate
  And dance in one long wish to hurt the world.

  A world that now is past all agony!




  FOUNTAINS

  "The graven fountain-masks suffer and weep.
  Carved with a smile, the poor mouths clutch
  At a half-remembered song,
  Striving to forget the agony of ever laughing."
                              SACHEVERELL SITWELL.


  Some fountains sing of love
  In full and flute-like notes that charge the night
  With all the red-mouthed essence of the rose;
  Then turn to voices murmuring above,
  Among the trees,
  Of hidden sweet delight.

  Another fountain flows
  With the faint music of a first spring breeze;
  Each falling drop is jewelled by the moon
  To some fine luminous ecstasy of light.
  It sings of noon,
  Of sunlit blossoms on a first spring day
  And all things sweet and pleasant to the sight.

  Another fountain sings
  Of the cool pleasures of those moonlit hours
  When dappled sylvan things
  Trample through thickets and through secret bowers
  To prance and play,
  Or, squatting round in rings,
  To wreathe their horned heads with wan sweet flowers
  Till dawn comes grey and sweeps them to the wood.

  Another fountain sobs
  Its song of passions that have passed away.
  Then with a sound like threatening rolling drums, it throbs
  And bursts into a flood
  Of fierce wild music; and its savage spray
  Becomes the blood
  Renewed, of crimes long past.

  Another fountain sings its song of fear,
  Of rustics flying fast
  Before some foe--
  A deadly, unknown foe that comes so near
  They feel his panting breath,
  And run for many a lengthy, panic mile.

  Those graven fountain-masks are white with woe!
  Carved with a happy smile
  They strive to weep...
  End their eternal laughing--for awhile
  To lose themselves in sleep
  Or in the silver peacefulness of death.




  SONG OF THE FAUNS

  When the woods are white beneath the moon
  And grass is wet with crystal dew,
  When in the pool
  So clear and cool
  The moon reflects itself anew,
  We raise ourselves from daylight's swoon,
  We shake away
  The sleep of day,
  Out from our bosky homes we spring;
  Horns wreathed with flowers,
  Throughout the hours
  Of moonlight, worshipping we sing.
  Pale iv'ry goddess, whose wan light
  Looks down upon us worshipping--
  Each dappled faun
  Who shuns the dawn,
  Is here, and rarest gifts we bring--
  The feathers of the birds of night
  Wrought to a crown
  Of softest down
  We offer you, and crystal bright,
  The dew within a lily cup
  Reflecting stars
  In shining bars;
  All things most strange we offer up--
  Rich gifts of fruit and honeyed flowers
  To place within your secret bowers.
  We shake down apples from the trees,
  And pears, and plums with velvet skin;
  Up to the sky
  We cast these high
  And pray you'll stoop to net them in.
  We dance: then fall upon our knees
  And pray and sing--all this to show
  The love that all loyal fauns must owe
  To you, white goddess of the night.
  But no more play,
  We must away,
  The eastern sky is growing bright.




  "A SCULPTOR'S CRUELTY"

  The faun runs through the forest of the noon,
    Then leaps into some lovely shrouded glade
    Splashed with hot light.  He dances in the shade
  Of tower-like trees, whose branches sway and swoon
    Beneath their weight of green.  No breath of air
  Ruffles the vivid blossom or the moss
    On which he pirouettes, all is so fair!

  He leaps about; then, tired and at a loss
    For what to do, he roams the wood--espies
  A figure like himself--but stiff and grey!
    Lacking the hairy chest and dappled thighs
  That are his pride.  "But surely this can play
    And scamper, dance and snuffle through the day
  As well as me?"  So he comes near and eyes
    The lichened features of a faun of stone.

  Oh! it is sad to be so young--alone!




  PIERROT OLD

  The harvest moon is at its height,
  The evening primrose greets its light
  With grace and joy: then opens up
  The mimic moon within its cup.
  Tall trees, as high as Babel tower,
  Throw down their shadows to the flower--
  Shadows that shiver--seem to see
  An ending to infinity.

  The Pagan Pan has now unbent
  And stoops to sniff the night-stock scent
  That brings a memory sad and old,
  When he was young, and free, and bold,
  To play his pipe in forests black,
  Or follow in some goatherd's track
  Who, fill'd with panic fear, then flees
  Through all the terror-threatening trees.

  Huge silver moths, like ghosts of flowers,
  Hover about the warm dark bowers,
  And wait to breathe the lime-tree scent
  That perfum'd many a compliment
  Address'd to beauties young and gay,
  Their faces powdered by the ray
  Of that same moon that looks upon
  Their dreary lichen-cover'd tomb.
  The dryads throw their water wide
  And strive to stem the surging tide
  That dashes up the fountain base,
  Hoping to catch the moon's pale face--
  A game now played without a score
  For three good centuries or more.
  And all the earth smells warm and sweet
  --A fitting place for fairy feet.

  But now a figure white and frail
  Leaps out into the moonlight pale.
  From wakeful thoughts, old age and grief,
  He finds in this strange world relief.
  Yet all the shadow, scent and sound,
  Poor Pierrot's mind do sad confound.
  Watch how he dances to the moon
  While singing some faint fragrant tune!

  But Pierrot now is tired and sad
  --Remembers all the evenings mad
  He spent with that fantastic band
  So gaily wand'ring o'er the land.
  They all are dead--and at an end,
  And he is left without a friend.
  For tho' the hours can pass away,
  Poor Pierrot still must grieve and stay.

  Upon the dewy grass he lies:
  The perfumes stir strange memories.
  Once more he hears a laughing cry
  That brings great tear-drops to his eye.
  That step--that look--that voice--that smile.
  Ah! they've been buried a long while!
  And who's the man in pantaloons,
  And he who sings such festive tunes?
  Why, it's that laughing man of sin,
  That roguish rascal Harlequin!

  Forgiving Pierrot hides his head
  Deep in the grass and mourns the dead;
  Forgetting all the pranks they play'd,
  And how he was himself betray'd.

  The butterfly lives but one day,
  But Pierrot still seems doom'd to stay.

  He falls asleep there, tragic-white,
  And wakes to find the bleak daylight.




  NIGHT

  All the dim terrors dwelling far below,
  Interr'd by many thousand years of life,
  Arise to revel in this evil dark:
  The wail forlorn of dogs that mourn for men--
  A shuffling footfall on a creaking board,
  The handle of a door that shakes and turns--
  A door that opens slightly, not enough:
  The rustling sigh of silk along a floor,
  The knowledge of being watched by one long dead,
  By something that is outside Nature's pale.
  The unheard sounds that haunt an ancient house:
  The feel of one who listens in the dark,
  Listens to that which happened long ago,
  Or what will happen after we are dust.
  The awful waiting for a near event,
  Or for a crash to rend the silence deep
  Enveloping a house that always waits--
  A house that whispers to itself and weeps.
  The murmur of the yew, or woodland cries,
  A sombre note of music on the breeze;
  A shudder from the ivy that entwines
  The horror that is felt within its grip.
  The sound of prowling things that walk abroad,
  The nauseous flapping of Night's bat-like wings--
  These are the signs the gods have given us
  To know the limit of our days and powers.

  FROM CARCASSONNE

  I

  Now night,
            The sighing night,
  Descends to hide and heal
  The crimson wounds
  Ripped in the sky,
  Where the high helmet-towers
  (With clouds as streaming feathers)
  Have torn the Heavens
  In their incessant sunset battle.

  Below,
        Upon the mound,
  Small golden flowers
  Release their daylight slowly
  At the Night's behest,
  Till they become pale discs
  That quiver
  When the evening wind
  Draws his thin fingers
  Down the dew-drenched grass
  --As an old harper,
  Who awakes
  From drunken sunlit slumber,
  Blindly plucks
  His silver-sounding strings,
  Making the sound
  That, further, darker down
  The trees make,
  When they draw back
  Their upturned leaves
  In fountain-foaming hurry.


  II

  The curling, hump-backed dolphins,
  Drunk with purple fumes
  Of wine-stained sunset,
  Plunge through the wider waters of the night--
  Waters that well down every narrow street
  In darkening billows,
  Till they become quiet, full--
  Canals that, mirror-like,
  Reflect each sound
  Of snarling song
  In all the town.

  And as the dolphins dive
  There splashes back
  Upon their goat-eared riders,
  Dislodged in sudden fury,
  The foaming froth of summer-cooling winds
  --Issuing from where the northern trees
  Bellow their resined breath
  Across the seas
  To ripple through far fields
  Of twilight flowers--
  Sweeping across
  To where these old high towers
  Of Carcassonne
  Still stand to break their flow.

  Neptune, from his high pedestal,
  Can watch the waters of the night
  Rise, further, further,
  And the faun-riders sink below
  The conquering, cool tide.




  PROGRESS

  The city's heat is like a leaden pall--
  Its lowered lamps glow in the midnight air
  Like mammoth orange-moths that flit and flare
  Through the dark tapestry of night.  The tall
  Black houses crush the creeping beggars down,
  Who walk beneath and think of breezes cool,
  Of silver bodies bathing in a pool,
  Or trees that whisper in some far, small town
  Whose quiet nursed them, when they thought that gold
  Was merely metal, not a grave of mould
  In which men bury all that's fine and fair.
  When they could chase the jewelled butterfly
  Through the green bracken-scented lanes, or sigh
  For all the future held so rich and rare;
  When, though they knew it not, their baby cries
  Were lovely as the jewelled butterflies.




  THE RETURN OF THE PRODIGAL

  I lay awake in that dim room of fear
  Which seemed to hold the essence of the night,
  Clutched in the grip of its tall sentient walls:
  Dark walls and high, that stretch for ever up--
  Up to the darkness, vague and menacing,
  As if no light could ever penetrate
  That mist of shadows, only cast a gloom
  More cavernous upon the atmosphere
  That seems to thicken into cloudy shapes,
  Substantiate--then disappear and die.
  And all the room is full of whisperings;
  Of moving things that hope I do not heed;
  And sudden gusts of wind blow cold upon
  My head, lifting the heavy mantle of the air,
  Revealing for an instant some vague thought
  Snatched from the haunting lumberland of dreams.
  Far in the distance, from the open night,
  Sounds an insistent hooting from the wood;
  The owl is calling to its kindred things.
  The bat emits its sinful piercing note--
  So high one cannot hear it, only feel
  The rhythm beat within the shrinking ear.
  A faint breeze blows in from the countryside,
  Rustling the curtains with the forest's breath,
  Stirring the grass of many an unknown tomb,
  Some new--some immemorably old,
  Whose dwellers never heard an owl at night,
  Only the reptile sounds and beating wings
  Of some forefather of that bird of night--
  Some flapping scaly monster with huge wings.
  Then, sudden, through the rustling of the room
  Silence shrills out its startling trumpet call
  Of terror, and the house is frozen still.
  Despair dropp'd down like rain upon my heart,
  Catching my breath and clutching at my throat.
  Fear magnified my senses, and my brain
  Could hear beyond the threshold of this world.
  Then through the threatening silence of the house,
  The silent waiting for the coming play--
  There came that halting well-remembered tread,
  The dreadful limp, and dragging of the feet,
  That cruel sin-white face looked through the door!
  And in my scream--that rent the trembling air,
  Reaching the woods and tainting them with death,
  Filling the fountain with strange ripplings
  That make the moon's reflection but a mask
  Like to that face of shame--my soul passed out--
  Out of my ashen lips, to find its end.




  LONDON SQUARES

  To-night this city seems delirious.  The air
  Is fever'd, hot and heavy--yet each street,
  Each tortuous lane and slumb'ring stone-bound square
  Smells of the open woods, so wild and sweet.
  Through the dim spaces, where each town-bred tree
  Sweeps out, mysterious and tall and still,
  The country's passionate spirit--old and free--
  Flings off the fetters of the calm and chill.

  There in the garden, fauns leap out and sing--
  Chant those strange sun-born songs from far away!
  With joyous ecstasy in this new spring,
  They cast the coats and top-hats of the day.

  There by the railings, where the women pace
  With painted faces, passionless and dead,
  Out of the dark, Pan shows his leering face,
  Mocks their large hats and faces painted red.
  Then as they walk away, he mocks their lives,
  Racking each wearied soul with lost desires,
  And--cruelty more subtle--he contrives
  With aching memories of love's first fires
  To tune their hearts up to a different key.

  So, when they sleep, the withered years unfold
  --Again, as children round a mother's knee
  They listen to their future as foretold
  --A future rich and innocent and gay.

  Then wake up to the agony of day!




  TEARS

  Silence o'erwhelms the melody of Night,
  Then slowly drips on to the woods that sigh
  For their past vivid vernal ecstasy.
  The branches and the leaves let in the light
  In patterns, woven 'gainst the paler sky
  --Create mysterious Gothic tracery
  Between those high dark pillars, that affright
  Poor weary mortals who are wand'ring by.

  Silence drips on the woods like sad faint rain
  Making each frail tired sigh a sob of pain;
  Each drop that falls, a hollow painted tear
  Such as are shed by Pierrots when they fear
  Black clouds may crush their silver lord to death.
  The world is waxen; and the wind's least breath
  Would make a hurricane of sound.  The earth
  Smells of the hoarded sunlight that gave birth
  To the gold-glowing radiance of that leaf
  Which falls to bury from our sight its grief.




  _To_ VIOLET GORDON-WOODHOUSE


  CLAVICHORDS

  Its pure and dulcet tone
  So clear and cool
  Rings out--tho' muffled by the centuries
  Passed by;
  Each note
  A distant sigh
  From some dead lovely throat.

  A sad cascade of sound
  Floods the dim room with faded memories
  Of beauty that has gone
  Like the reflected rhythm in some dusk blue pool,
  Of dancing figures (long laid in the ground)--
  Like moonlit skies
  Or some far song harmonious and sublime--
  Breaking the leaden slumber of the night.
  A perfume, faint yet fair
  As of an old press'd blossom that's reborn
  Seeming to flower alone
  Within the arid wilderness of Time.

  The music fills the air
  Soft as the outspread fluttering wings
  Of flower-bright butterflies
  That dive and float
  Through the sweet rose-flushed hours of summer dawn.
  The rippling sound of silver strings
  Break o'er our senses as small foaming waves
  Break over rocks,
  And into hidden caves
  Of silent waters--never to be found--
  Waters as clear and glistening as gems.

  And in this ancient pool of melodies,
  So soothing, deep,
  We search for strange lost images and diadems
  And old drowned pleasures,
  --Each one shining bright
  And rescued from the crystal depths of sleep.

  As the far sun-kissed sails of some full-rigged boat,
  Blown by a salt cool breeze,
  --Laden with age-old treasures
  And rich merchandise--
  Fade into evening on the foam-flecked seas--
  So this last glowing note
  Hovers awhile--then dies.




  PROMENADES

  Long promenades against the sea
  Kaleidoscopic, chattering!
  Pavilions rising from the sea,
  On which a fawning, flattering,
  Hot crush of orientals move,
  And sell their cheap and tawdry wares,
  To other Jews, and aldermen,
  And rich, retired, provincial mayors.
  Oh! many colours in the sun;
  Copper and gold predominate!
  Parasols, held 'gainst the sun
  Throw down their shadows incohate
  On leering faces looking sly--
  All shining with the heat of June.
  The shifting masses move and talk
  And whistle tunes all out of tune.

  Long promenades against the sea,
  And oranges and mandolines!
  Pavilions rising from the sea
  And penny-in-the-slot machines!




  CLOWN PONDI

  When youth and strength had changed my blood to fire
    And every day passed long and glorious,
  Another link in the eternal chain
    Of life, I turned my love of luring and my sense
  For all the unfathomable ways of God,
    My burning sense for laughter and my joy
  In crowds, in tumult, and in blazing lights,
    To make my fellows see these qualities.
  Thus I became "Clown Pondi," and my fame
    Grew high in every theatre in the land.

  I seem'd to draw fresh vigour from the crowds--
    Loving the sea of faces, eyes with tears,
  And gaping mouths wide open--loosely hung;
    The acrid, opalescent haze of smoke,
  Hanging above the auditorium.
    And over it the crowded galleries
  That float far up, like painted prows of ships--
    All overweighted and alive with men.
  I loved the limelight, hard and white and strong,
    The throbbing music and the theatre's scent,
  That artificial, paper, printed scent
    That sweeps across the footlights to the stalls.

  Then was I pleased to strut about the stage,
    With face dead white, and strangely purple nose--
  Flamboyant in the garb of foolery--
    To run about too quickly--and fall down;
  To make queer noises--inarticulate
    Strange sounds and oaths, the signal for my share
  Of cackling laughter.
                        Thus the years pass'd by
  And--all unheeding--swept away my youth,
    Till, one sad night, I heard a voice near-by:
  "Ah!  Poor old man!  It's shocking they should laugh;
    Mock his bent legs, and poor old toothless jaws!"

  And then old-age rush'd down upon my head,
    Each sombre year roll'd past in solemn time;
  In true perspective--to the jingling tune
    That was my exit; and so near came death,
  Holding a mirror to my ridicule,
    That show'd each line beneath the smearing paint,
  Each wrinkle underneath the dab of rouge,

  That in my sudden hopelessness I wept.
    But as I left the stage with dragging feet,
  With body bent with age, and crouching low,
    I heard the applauding people pause and say,
    "Who but Clown Pondi could amuse us so?"




  LAUSIAC THEME

  SERAPION-THE-SINDONITE
  Wore a cloth about his loins.
  This Christian Recondite
  Never carried coins.

  Never did he ask for bread;
  Revelled in his own distress.
  High of spirit, low of head,
  With no other dress

  Than a loin-cloth, Serapion
  Was free from greed and gluttony
  Progressed in the direction
  Of impassivity.

  Serapion, though ascetic,
  Could not keep within his cell--
  Spiritual athletic,
  Who wrestled with Hell--

  This Sindonitic holy man
  Converted, overcome by pity,
  Thais, the famous courtesan,
  To Christianity.

  Thais was not thin or frail
  But full of figure.  Flesh and blood
  Rose up in riot--made her rail
  At a selfless God.

  From Theban windows, far above,
  She plays and sings to a guitar
  With low voice: the light of love
  Beckons like a star.

  Eagerly she welcomed in
  The unexpected Sindonite;
  But he spoke to her of sin--
  Set her soul alight.

  So they went together out
  To the crowded, garish street,
  Where he taught her how to flout
  Fumes of wine and meat.

  To the Thebaid they go--
  Where she stands each Christian test,
  Plaiting palm-leaves to and fro,
  Sure of heaven's rest.

  In the desert they both died,
  Thais and the holy man.
  They were buried side by side,
  Ascetic and courtesan.




  METAMORPHOSIS

  The woods that ever love the moon, rest calm and white
  Beneath a mist-wrapp'd hill:
  An owl, horned wizard of the night,
  Flaps through the air so soft and still;
  Moaning, it wings its flight
  Far from the forest cool,
  To find the star-entangled surface of a pool,
  Where it may drink its fill
  Of stars; a blossom-laden breeze
  Scatters its treasures--each a fallen moon
  Among the waiting trees--
  Bears back the faded shadow-scents of noon.

  The whispering wood is full of dim, vague fears.
  The rustling branches sway
  And listen for some sound from far away--
  A silver piping down the Pagan years
  Since Time's first joyous birth--
  The listening trees all sigh,
  The moment of their hornèd king is nigh.
  Then, peal on peal, there sounds the fierce wild mirth
  Of Pan their master, lord and king,
  And round him in a moonlit ring
  His court, so wan and sly!

  But then the trees closed round and hid from sight
  Their deeds--the voices seemed to die.

  An owl, horned wizard of the night,
  Flaps through the air so soft and still.
  Moans, as it wings its flight
  Toward the mist-wrapp'd hill.




  THE GIPSY QUEEN

  A ragged Gipsy walked the road,
  Her eyes blazed fierce and strong,
  But she gazed at me as on she strode,
  She fiercely gazed, and long.

  "Give me a penny, sir," she said,
  "To buy me drink and buy me bread,
  For I've nothing had to eat or drink,
  And at night I never sleep a wink.
  Cold is the snow and wet the rain,
  But my soul died when my love was slain!"

  "Fair Gipsy, in some southern clime,
  I've seen your face before
  In some far other distant time,
  But whom are you weeping for?"

  "'Twas Antony I loved," she said,
  "For him, in vain, I shed these tears,
  But my loved Antony is dead--
  Is dead these long two thousand years;

  Then I was mighty Egypt's pride,
  Fear'd both by friend and foe--

  Yet they believe Cleopatra died
  Two thousand years ago!"




  BLACK MASS

  The atmosphere is charged with hidden things
  --Thoughts that are waiting--wanting to revive
  Primeval terrors from their present graves
  --Those half-thoughts hidden from the mind of man.

  The fear of those bright, countless stars that shine
  Celestially serene on summer nights,
  --And those, too far for human eye to see--
  That make men feel as small and ill at ease
  As do the thoughts of immortality;
  The fear of seas that stretch beyond our sight
  Unspoilt by any memory of a ship--
  Strange, silent seas that lap the unknown shores
  Of some far-distant, undiscovered land;
  The curious fear of caves and horrid depths
  Where lurk those monsters that we hide away
  And bury in our self-complacency.
  The dread of all that waits unseen, yet heard;
  The fear of moonlight falling on a face;
  The sound of sobs at night, the fear of laughter;
  The misty terror lurking in a wood
  Which night has wrapped in her soft robe of sighs.

  The horror that is felt where man is not,
  In lonely lands all dotted with squat trees
  That seem to move in the grey twilight breeze
  --Or sit and watch you like malicious cripples,
  Intent on every movement, every thought--
  Where stones, like evil fungi, raise their bulk
  Cover'd with lichen older than the hills--
  A warning for the ages yet to come;
  Stones that have seen the sun, and moon, and stars,
  Deflect their course for very weariness.
  These fears are gathered, press'd into a room
  Vibrating with the wish to damage man;
  To put a seal upon his mind and soul--
  These fears are fused into a living flame.

  The room is filled with men of evil thoughts,
  And some poor timid ones, on evil bent.
  They stand in anxious, ghastly expectation.

  The guttering light is low, and follows them
  With subtle shadows tall beyond belief:
  Vast elemental shapes that make men feel
  Like dusty atoms blown by wayward winds
  About the world: shadows that sway and swing.
  And sigh and talk, as if themselves alive.
  Small shadows cringe about the room incredibly,
  Grotesque and dwarf-like in their attitudes;
  Malignant, mocking things that caper round--
  Triumphant heralds of an evil reign.

  Secret and swift they flit about the wall;
  Noiseless, they drag their feet about the floor,
  And murmur subtle infamies of love,
  Sweet-sounding threats, and bribes, and baleful thoughts.

  Yet all are waiting, evilly alert...
  Yet all are waiting--watching for events.

  Silence has ceased to be a negative,
  Becomes a thing of substance--fills the room
  And clings like ivy to the listening walls.
  The flickering light flares up--then gutters out.
  The shadows seem to shiver and expand
  To active, evil things that breathe and live.

  But now they whirl and dance in ecstasy.
  The highest moment of their mass is near.
  We only feel the swaying of the shades,
  --Rhythm of wicked music that escapes
  Our consciousness, tho' we have known it long--
  The music of the evil things of Night
  Scarcely remembered from some dim, vast world--
  The things that haunted us when we were young
  And nearer to our past realities.
  Like scaly snakes, the hymn to evil writhes
  Through the sub-conscious basis of our mind.
  Eddies of icy breath, or hot as flame,
  Twist into all the corners of the room,
  Filling our veins with fire like red-hot iron,
  And wicked as the Prince of Evil Things.

  Faintly his glowing presence is revealed to us
  Amid the chorus of his satellites.
  The consummation of our awful hopes.




  PIERROT AT THE WAR

  The leaden years have dragged themselves away;
    The blossoms of the world lie all dash'd down
  And flattened by the hurricane of death:
  The roses fallen, and their fragrant breath
    Has passed beyond our senses--and we drown
  Our tragic thoughts: confine them to the day.

  Pierrot was happy here two years ago,
    Singing through all the summer-scented hours,
  Dancing throughout the warm moon-haunted night.
  Swan-like his floating sleeves, so long and white,
    Sailed the blue waters of the dusk.  Wan flowers,
  Like moons, perfumed the crystal valley far below.

  But now these moonlit sleeves lie on the ground,
    Trampled and torn from many a deadly fight.
  With fingers clenched, and face a mask of stone,
  He gazes at the sky--left all alone--
    Grimacing under every rising light:
  His body waits the peace his soul has found.

  SPRING HOURS

  The air is silken--soft and dark--
  Calm as the waters of some blue, far sea;
    Sweet as a youthful dream,
  The trees stand cold and stark,
  Yet full of the new life which makes each tree
  To tremble with delight; sets free
    The summer rapture of the stream.

  But now the clouds disperse and drift away,
    Splashing the woods with patches of pale light,
  Sail off like silver ships, and then display
    The dazzling myriad blossoms of the night.

  Ah!  It is worth full many a sun-gilt hour
  To see the heavens bursting into flower.

  "THEREFORE IS THE NAME OF IT CALLED BABEL"

  And still we stood and stared far down
  Into that ember-glowing town,
  Which every shaft and shock of fate
  Had shorn unto its base.  Too late
    Came carelessly Serenity.

  Now torn and broken houses gaze
  On to the rat-infested maze
  That once sent up rose-silver haze
    To mingle through eternity.

  The outlines once so strongly wrought,
  Of city walls, are now a thought
  Or jest unto the dead who fought...
    Foundation for futurity.

  The shimmering sands where once there played
  Children with painted pail and spade
  Are dreary desolate--afraid
    To meet night's dark humanity,

  Whose silver cool remakes the dead,
  And lays no blame on any head
  For all the havoc, fire, and lead,
    That fell upon us suddenly,

  When all we came to know as good
  Gave way to Evil's fiery flood,
  And monstrous myths of iron and blood
    Seem to obscure God's clarity.

  Deep sunk in sin, this tragic star
  Sinks deeper still, and wages war
  Against itself; strewn all the seas
  With victims of a world disease
  --And we are left to drink the lees
  Of Babel's direful prophecy.

  TWENTIETH-CENTURY HARLEQUINADE

  Fate, malign dotard, weary from his days,
  Too old for memory, yet craving pleasure,
  Now finds the night too long and bitter cold
  --Reminding him of death--the sun too hot.
  The beauty of the universe he hates,
  Yet stands regarding earthly carnivals:
  The clatter and the clang of car and train,
  The hurrying throng of homeward-going men,
  The cries of children, colour of the streets,
  Their whistling and their shouting and their joy,
  The lights, the trees, the fanes and towers of churches,
  Thanksgiving for the sun, the moon, the earth,
  The labour, love, and laughter of our lives.

  He thinks they mock his age with ribaldry.

  From far within his æon-battered brain
  Well up those wanton wistful images
  That first beguiled the folk of Bergamo.
  Now like himself, degraded and distress'd,
  They sink to ignominy; but the clown
  Remains, reminder of their former state,
  And still earns hurricanes of hoarse applause.

  This dotard now decides to end the earth
  (Wrecked by its own and his futility).
  Recalls the formula of world-broad mirth
  --A senseless hitting of those unaware,
  Unnecessary breaking of their chattels.

  The pantomime of life is near its close:
  The stage is strewn with ends and bits of things,
  With mortals maim'd or crucified, and left
  To gape at endless horror through eternity.

  The face of Fate is wet with other paint
  Than that incarnadines the human clown:
  Yet still he waves a bladder, red as gold,
  And still he gaily hits about with it,
  And still the dread revealing limelight plays
  Till the whole sicken'd scene becomes afire.
  Antic himself falls on the funeral pyre
  Of twisted, tortured, mortifying men.

  THIS GENERATION

  Their youth was fevered--passionate, quick to drain
    The last few pleasures from the cup of life
  Before they turn'd to suck the dregs of pain
    And end their young-old lives in mortal strife.
  They paid the debts of many a hundred year
    Of foolishness and riches in alloy.
  They went to death; nor did they shed a tear
    For all they sacrificed of love and joy.
  Their tears ran dry when they were in the womb,
  For, entering life--they found it was their tomb.

  _To_ FRANCIS MEYNELL


  SHEEP-SONG

  From within our pens,
  Stout built,
  We watch the sorrows of the world.
  Imperturbably
  We see the blood
  Drip and ooze on to the walls.
  Without a sigh
  We watch our lambs
  Stuffed and fattened for the slaughter....

  In our liquid eyes lie hidden
  The mystery of empty spaces
  All the secrets of the vacuum.

  Yet we can be moved;
  When the head-sheep bleats,
  We bleat with him;
  When he stampedes
  --Heavy with foot-rot--
  We gallop after him
  Until
  In our frenzy
  We trip him up
  --And a new sheep leads us.

  We are the greatest sheep in the world;
  There are no sheep like us.
  We come of an imperial bleat;
  Our voices,
  Trembling with music,
  Call to our lambs oversea.
  With us they crash across continents.

  We will not heed the herdsmen,
  For they warned us,
  "Do not stampede";
  Yet we were forced to do so.
  Never will we trust a herdsman again.

  Then the black lamb asked,
  Saying, "Why did we start this glorious Gadarene descent?"
  And the herd bleated angrily,
  "We went in with clean feet,
  And we will come out with empty heads.
  We gain nothing by it,
  Therefore
  It is a noble thing to do.
  We are stampeding to end stampedes.
  We are fighting for lambs
  Who are never likely to be born.

  When once a sheep gets its blood up
  The goats will remember...."

  But the herdsman swooped down
  Shouting,
  "Get back to your pens there."

  THE POET'S LAMENT.

  Before the dawning of the death-day
  My mind was a confusion of beauty.
  Thoughts fell from it in riot
  Of colour,
  In wreaths and garlands of flowers and fruit...

  Then the red dawn came
  --And no thought came to me
  Except anger
  And bitter reproach.
  God filled my mouth
  With the burning pebbles of hatred,
  And choked my soul
  With a whirl-wind of fury.
  He made my tongue
  A flaming sword
  To cut and wither
  The white soft edges
  Of their anæmic souls.
  I ridiculed them,
  I despised them,
  I loathed them
  ... But they had stolen my soul away.

  Yes, they had stolen my soul from me.
  My heart jumps up into my mouth
  In fury;
  They have stolen my soul away.

  But we will wait,
  And later words will come
  --Words that in their burning flight
  Shall scorch and flay,
  Or flare like fireworks
  Above their heads.
  In those days my soul shall be restored to me
  And they shall remember,
  They shall remember!




  JUDAS AND THE PROFITEER

  Judas descended to this lower Hell
    To meet his only friend--the profiteer--
  Who, looking fat and rubicund and well,
    Regarded him, and then said with a sneer,
  "Iscariot, they did you!  Fool! to sell
    For silver pence the body of God's Son,
  Whereas for maiming men with sword and shell
    I gain at least a golden million."

  But Judas answered: "You deserve your gold;
  It's not His body but His soul you've sold!"




  _To_ H. W. MASSINGHAM


  RHAPSODE

  Why should we sing to you of little things--
  You who lack all imagination?
  Why should we sing to you of your poor joys,
  That you may see beauty through a poet's mind--
  Beauty where there was none before?
  Why should we heed your miserable opinions,
  And your paltry fears?
  Why listen to your tales and narratives--
  Long lanes of boredom along which you
  Amble amiably all the dull days
  Of your unnecessary lives?
  We know you now--and what you wish to be told:
  That the larks are singing in the trenches,
  That the fruit trees will again blossom in the spring,
  That Youth is always happy;
  But you know the misery that lies
  Under the surface--
  And we will dig it up for you!
  We shall sing to you
  Of the men who have been trampled
  To death in the circus of Flanders;
  Of the skeletons that gather the fruit
  From the ruined orchards of France;
  And of those left to rot under an Eastern sun--
  Whose dust mingles with the sand
  Of distant, strange deserts,
  And whose bones are crushed against
  The rocks of unknown seas;
  All dead--dead,
  Defending you and what you stand for.

  You hope that we shall tell you that they found their
        happiness in fighting,
  Or that they died with a song on their lips,
  Or that we shall use the old familiar phrases
  With which your paid servants please you in the Press:
  But we are poets,
  And shall tell the truth.

  You, my dear sir,
  You are so upset
  At being talked to in this way
  That when night
  Has coffin'd this great city
  Beneath the folds of the sun's funeral pall,
  You will have to drink a little more champagne,
  And visit a theatre or perhaps a music-hall.
  What you need (as you rightly say, my dear sir) is CHEERING-UP.
  There you will see vastly funny sketches
  Of your fighting countrymen;
  And they will be represented
  As those of whom you may be proud.
  For they cannot talk English properly,
  Or express themselves but by swearing;
  Or perhaps they may be shown as drunk.
  But they will all appear cheerful,
  And you will be pleased;
  And as you lurch amiably home, you will laugh,
  And at each laugh
  Another countryman will be dead!

  When Christ was slowly dying on that tree--
  Hanging in agony upon that hideous Cross--
  Tortured, betrayed, and spat upon,
  Loud through the thunder and the earthquake's roar
  Rang out
  Those blessed humble human words of doubt:
  "My God!  My God! why hast Thou forsaken Me?"
  But near by was a cheerfully chattering group
  Of sects,
  Of Pharisees and Sadducees,
  And all were shocked--
  Pained beyond measure.
  And they said:
  "At least he might have died like a hero
  With an oath on his lips,
  Or the refrain from a comic song--
  Or a cheerful comment of some kind.
  It was very unpleasant for all of us--
      But we had to see it through.
  I hope people will not think we have gone too far--
  Or behaved badly in any way."

  There in the street below a drunken man reels home,
  And as he goes
  He sings with sentiment:
  "Keep the home fires burning!"
  And the constable helps him on his way.
      But we--
      We should be thrown into prison,
  Or cast into an asylum,
  For we want--
              PEACE!

  THE MODERN ABRAHAM

  His purple fingers clutch a large cigar--
    Plump, mottled fingers, with a ring or two.
  He rests back in his fat armchair.  The war
    Has made this change in him.  As he looks through
  His cheque-book with a tragic look he sighs:
    "Disabled Soldiers' Fund" he reads afresh,
  And through his meat-red face peer angry eyes--
    The spirit piercing through its mound of flesh.

  They should not ask me to subscribe again!
    Consider me and all that I have done--
  I've fought for Britain with my might and main;
    I make explosives--and I gave a son.
  My factory, converted for the fight
    (I do not like to boast of what I've spent),
  Now manufactures gas and dynamite,
    Which only pays me seventy per cent.
  And if I had ten other sons to send
  I'd make them serve my country to the end,
  So all the neighbours should flock round and say:
    "Oh! look what Mr. Abraham has done.
  He loves his country in the elder way;
    Poor gentleman, he's lost another son!"

  THE TRAP

  The world is young and green.
  Its woods are golden beneath the May-time sun;
  But within its trap of steel the rabbit plunges
  Madly to and fro.
  It will bleed to death
  Slowly,
        Slowly,
  Unless there is some escape.
  Why will not someone release it?

  And presently a kindly passer-by
  Stoops down.
  The rabbit's eye glints at him--
  Gleaming from the impenetrable obscurity of its prison.
  He stoops and lifts the catch
  (He cannot hold it long, for the spring is heavy).
  The rabbit could now be free,
  But it does not move;
  For from the darkness of its death-hutch
  The world looks like another brightly baited trap.
  So, remaining within its steel prison,
  It argues thus:
  "Perhaps I may bleed to death,
  But it will probably take a long time,
  And, at any rate,
  I am secure
  From the clever people outside.
  Besides, if I did come out now
  All the people who thought I was a lion
  Would see, by the trap-mark on my leg,
  That I am only an unfortunate rabbit,
  And this might promote disloyalty among the children.
  When the clamp closed on my leg
  It was a ruse
  To kill me.
  Probably the lifting of it betrays the same purpose!
  If I come out now
  They will think they can trap rabbits
  Whenever they like.
  How do I know they will not snare me
  Again next year?
  Besides, it looks to me from here..."

  But the catch drops down,
  For the stranger is weary.
  From within the hutch
  A thin stream of blood
  Trickles on to the grass
  Outside,
  And leaves a brown stain on its brightness.
  But the dying rabbit is happy,
  Saying:
  "I knew it was only a trap!"

  _To_ RODERICK MEIKLEJOHN


  THE ETERNAL CLUB

  Warming their withered hands, the dotards say:
    "In our youth men were happy till they died.
  What is it ails the young men of to-day--
    To make them bitter and dissatisfied?"

  Two thousand years ago it was the same:
    "Poor Joseph!  How he'll feel about his son!
  I knew him as a child--his head aflame
    With gold.  He seemed so full of life and fun.
  And even as a young man he was fine,
  Converting tasteless water into wine.
  Then something altered him.  He tried to chase
    The money-changers from the Temple door.
    White ringlets swung and tears shone in their poor
    Aged eyes.  He grew so bitter and found men
  For friends as discontented--lost all count
    Of caste--denied his father, faith, and then
  He preached that dreadful Sermon on the Mount!
    But even then he would not let things be;
    For when they nailed him high up on the tree,
    And gave him vinegar and pierced his side,
    He asked God to forgive them--still dissatisfied!"




  HEAVEN

  A theatre rises dark and mute and drear
    Among those houses that stand clustering round.
  Passing this pleasure-house, I seem'd to hear
    The distant rhythm of some lauding sound,
  The hot applause that greeted every night
  The favourite song, or girl, or joke, or fight.
    The laughter of the young and strong and gay
    Who greeted life--then laid their lives away.

  Do they, then, watch the same old blatant show,
    Forgetting all death's wrench and all its pain
  And all their courage shown against the foe?
    Is this the heaven that they died to gain?




  THE BLIND PEDLAR

  I stand alone through each long day
  Upon these pavers; cannot see
  The wares spread out upon this tray
  --For God has taken sight from me!

  Many a time I've cursed the night
  When I was born.  My peering eyes
  Have sought for but one ray of light
  To pierce the darkness.  When the skies

  Rain down their first sweet April showers
  On budding branches; when the morn
  Is sweet with breath of spring and flowers,
  I've cursed the night when I was born.

  But now I thank God, and am glad
  For what I cannot see this day
  --The young men crippled, old, and sad,
  With faces burnt and torn away;

  Or those who, rich and old,
  Have battened on the slaughter,
  Whose faces, gorged with blood and gold,
  Are creased in purple laughter!

  WORLD-HYMN TO MOLOCH

  Holy Moloch, blessed lord,
  Hatred to our souls impart.
  Put the heathen to the sword,
  Wound and pierce each contrite heart.
  Never more shall darkness fall
  But it seems a funeral pall;
  Never shall the red sun rise
  But to red and swollen eyes.
  In the centuries that roll,
  Slowly grinding out our tears,
  Often thou hast taken toll;
  Never till these latter years
  Have all nations lost the fray;
  Lead not thou our feet astray.
  Never till the present time
  Have we offered all we hold,
  With one gesture, mad, sublime,
  Sons and lovers, lands and gold.
  Must we then still pray to thee,
  Moloch, for a victory?

  Eternal Moloch, strong to slay,
  Do not seek to heal or save.
  Lord, it is the better way
  Swift to send them to the grave.
  Those of us too old to go
  Send our sons to face the foe,
  But, O lord! we must remain
  Here, to pray and sort the slain.
  In every land the widows weep,
  In every land the children cry.
  Other gods are lulled to sleep,
  All the starving peoples die.
  What is left to offer you?
  Thou, O Sacred King of Death!
  God of Blood and Lord of Guile,
  Do not let us waste our breath,
  Cast on us thy crimson smile.
  Moloch, lord, we pray to thee,
  Send at least one victory.

  All the men in every land
  Pray to thee through battle's din,
  Swiftly now to show thy hand,
  Pray that soon one side may win.
  Under sea and in the sky,
  Everywhere our children die;
  Laughter, happiness and light
  Perished in a single night.
  In every land the heaving tides
  Wash the sands a dreadful red,
  In every land the tired sun hides
  Under heaps and hills of dead.
  In spite of all we've offered up
  Must we drink and drain the cup?
  Everywhere the dark floods rise,
  Everywhere our hearts are torn.
  Every day a new Christ dies,
  Every day a devil's born.
  Moloch, lord, we pray to thee,
  Send at least one victory.

  ARMCHAIR

  If I were still of handsome middle-age
  I should not govern yet, but still should hope
  To help the prosecution of this war.
  I'd talk and eat (though not eat wheaten bread),
  I'd send my sons, if old enough, to France,
  Or help to do my share in other ways.
  All through the long spring evenings, when the sun
  Pursues its primrose path towards the hills,
  If fine, I'd plant potatoes on the lawn;
  If wet, write anxious letters to the Press.
  I'd give up wine and spirits, and with pride
  Refuse to eat meat more than once a day,
  And seek to rob the workers of their beer.
  The only way to win a hard-fought war
  Is to annoy the people in small ways,
  Bully or patronise them, as you will!
  I'd teach poor mothers, who have seven sons
  --All fighting men of clean and sober life--
  How to look after babies and to cook;
  Teach them to save their money and invest;
  Not to bring children up in luxury
  --But do without a nursemaid in the house!

  If I were old, or only seventy,
  Then should I be a great man in his prime.
  I should rule army corps; at my command
  Men would rise up, salute me, and attack
  --And die.  Or I might also govern men
  By making speeches with my toothless jaws,
  Chattering constantly; and men should say,
  "One grand old man is still worth half his pay!"
  That day I'd send my grandsons out to France
  --And wish I'd got ten other ones to send
  (One cannot sacrifice too much, I'd say).
  Then would I make a noble toothless speech,
  And all the listening Parliament would cheer.
  "Gentlemen, we will never end this war
  Till all the younger men with martial mien
  Have entered capitals; never make peace
  Till they are cripples, on one leg, or dead!"
  Then would the Bishops all go mad with joy,
  Cantuar, Ebor, and the other ones,
  Be overwhelmed with pious ecstasy.
  In thanking Him we'd got a Christian--
  An Englishman--still worth his salt--to talk,
  In every pulpit they would preach and prance;
  And our great Church would work, as heretofore,
  To bring this poor old nation to its knees.
  Then we'd forbid all liberty, and make
  Free speech a relic of our impious past;
  And when this war is finished, when the world
  Is torn and bleeding, cut and bruised to death,
  Then I'd pronounce my peace terms--to the poor!
  But as it is, I am not ninety yet,
  And so must pay my reverence to these men--
  These grand old men, who still can see and talk,
  Who sacrifice each other's sons each day.
  O Lord! let me be ninety yet, I pray.
  Methuselah was quite a youngster when
  He died.  Now, vainly weeping, we should say:
  "Another great man perished in his prime!"
  O let me govern, Lord, at ninety-nine!"

  RAGTIME

  The lamps glow here and there, then echo down
  The vast deserted vistas of the town--
  Each light the echo'd note of some refrain
  Repeated in the city's fevered brain.
  Yet all is still, save when there wanders past
  --Finding the silence of the night too long--
  Some tattered wretch, who, from the night outcast,
  Sings, with an aching heart, a comic song.
  The vapid parrot-words flaunt through the night--
  Silly and gay, yet terrible.  We know
  Men sang these words in many a deadly fight,
  And threw them--laughing--to a solemn foe;
  Sang them where tattered houses stand up tall and stark,
  And bullets whistle through the ruined street,
  Where live men tread on dead men in the dark,
  And skulls are sown in fields once sown with wheat.
  Across the sea, where night is dark with blood
  And rockets flash, and guns roar hoarse and deep,
  They struggle through entanglements and mud,
  They suffer wounds--and die--
                              But here they sleep.
  From far away the outcast's vacuous song
  Re-echoes like the singing of a throng;
  His dragging footfalls echo down the street,
  And turn into a myriad marching feet.

  PEACE CELEBRATION

  Now we can say of those who died unsung,
  Unwept for, torn, "Thank God they were not blind
  Or mad!  They've perished strong and young,
  Missing the misery we elders find
  In missing them."  With such a platitude
  We try to cheer ourselves.  And for each life
  Laid down for us, with duty well-imbued,
  With song-on-lip, in splendid soldier strife--
  For sailors, too, who willingly were sunk--
  We'll shout "Hooray!"--
                      And get a little drunk.




  _To_ SACHEVERELL


  THE NEXT WAR

  The long war had ended.
  Its miseries had grown faded.
  Deaf men became difficult to talk to.
  Heroes became bores.

  Those alchemists
  Who had converted blood into gold,
  Had grown elderly.
  But they held a meeting,
  Saying,
  "We think perhaps we ought
  To put up tombs
  Or erect altars
  To those brave lads
  Who were so willingly burnt,
  Or blinded,
  Or maimed,
  Who lost all likeness to a living thing,
  Or were blown to bleeding patches of flesh
  For our sakes.
  It would look well.
  Or we might even educate the children."

  But the richest of these wizards
  Coughed gently;
  And he said,
  "I have always been to the front
  --In private enterprise--
  I yield in public spirit
  To no man.
  I think yours is a very good idea
  --A capital idea--
  And not too costly.
  But it seems to me
  That the cause for which we fought
  Is again endangered.
  What more fitting memorial for the fallen
  Than that their children
  Should fall for the same cause?"
  Rushing eagerly into the street,
  The kindly old gentlemen cried
  To the young:
      "Will you sacrifice
      Through your lethargy
      What your fathers died to gain?
      Our cause is in peril.
  The world must be made safe for the young!"
  And the children
  Went....


The Wild Swans at Coole


THE WILD SWANS AT COOLE

    The trees are in their autumn beauty,
    The woodland paths are dry,
    Under the October twilight the water
    Mirrors a still sky;
    Upon the brimming water among the stones
    Are nine and fifty swans.

    The nineteenth Autumn has come upon me
    Since I first made my count;
    I saw, before I had well finished,
    All suddenly mount
    And scatter wheeling in great broken rings
    Upon their clamorous wings.

    I have looked upon those brilliant creatures,
    And now my heart is sore.
    All's changed since I, hearing at twilight,
    The first time on this shore,
    The bell-beat of their wings above my head,
    Trod with a lighter tread.

    Unwearied still, lover by lover,
    They paddle in the cold,
    Companionable streams or climb the air;
    Their hearts have not grown old;
    Passion or conquest, wander where they will,
    Attend upon them still.

    But now they drift on the still water
    Mysterious, beautiful;
    Among what rushes will they build,
    By what lake's edge or pool
    Delight men's eyes, when I awake some day
    To find they have flown away?




IN MEMORY OF MAJOR ROBERT GREGORY

    Now that we're almost settled in our house
    I'll name the friends that cannot sup with us
    Beside a fire of turf in the ancient tower,
    And having talked to some late hour
    Climb up the narrow winding stair to bed:
    Discoverers of forgotten truth
    Or mere companions of my youth,
    All, all are in my thoughts to-night, being dead.




    Always we'd have the new friend meet the old,
    And we are hurt if either friend seem cold,
    And there is salt to lengthen out the smart
    In the affections of our heart,
    And quarrels are blown up upon that head;
    But not a friend that I would bring
    This night can set us quarrelling,
    For all that come into my mind are dead.

    Lionel Johnson comes the first to mind,
    That loved his learning better than mankind,
    Though courteous to the worst; much falling he
    Brooded upon sanctity
    Till all his Greek and Latin learning seemed
    A long blast upon the horn that brought
    A little nearer to his thought
    A measureless consummation that he dreamed.

    And that enquiring man John Synge comes next,
    That dying chose the living world for text
    And never could have rested in the tomb
    But that, long travelling, he had come
    Towards nightfall upon certain set apart
    In a most desolate stony place,
    Towards nightfall upon a race
    Passionate and simple like his heart.

    And then I think of old George Pollexfen,
    In muscular youth well known to Mayo men
    For horsemanship at meets or at race-courses,
    That could have shown how purebred horses
    And solid men, for all their passion, live
    But as the outrageous stars incline
    By opposition, square and trine;
    Having grown sluggish and contemplative.

    They were my close companions many a year,
    A portion of my mind and life, as it were,
    And now their breathless faces seem to look
    Out of some old picture-book;
    I am accustomed to their lack of breath,
    But not that my dear friend's dear son,
    Our Sidney and our perfect man,
    Could share in that discourtesy of death.

    For all things the delighted eye now sees
    Were loved by him; the old storm-broken trees
    That cast their shadows upon road and bridge;
    The tower set on the stream's edge;
    The ford where drinking cattle make a stir
    Nightly, and startled by that sound
    The water-hen must change her ground;
    He might have been your heartiest welcomer.

    When with the Galway foxhounds he would ride
    From Castle Taylor to the Roxborough side
    Or Esserkelly plain, few kept his pace;
    At Mooneen he had leaped a place
    So perilous that half the astonished meet
    Had shut their eyes, and where was it
    He rode a race without a bit?
    And yet his mind outran the horses' feet.

    We dreamed that a great painter had been born
    To cold Clare rock and Galway rock and thorn,
    To that stern colour and that delicate line
    That are our secret discipline
    Wherein the gazing heart doubles her might.
    Soldier, scholar, horseman, he,
    And yet he had the intensity
    To have published all to be a world's delight.

    What other could so well have counselled us
    In all lovely intricacies of a house
    As he that practised or that understood
    All work in metal or in wood,
    In moulded plaster or in carven stone?
    Soldier, scholar, horseman, he,
    And all he did done perfectly
    As though he had but that one trade alone.

    Some burn damp fagots, others may consume
    The entire combustible world in one small room
    As though dried straw, and if we turn about
    The bare chimney is gone black out
    Because the work had finished in that flare.
    Soldier, scholar, horseman, he,
    As 'twere all life's epitome.
    What made us dream that he could comb grey hair?

    I had thought, seeing how bitter is that wind
    That shakes the shutter, to have brought to mind
    All those that manhood tried, or childhood loved,
    Or boyish intellect approved,
    With some appropriate commentary on each;
    Until imagination brought
    A fitter welcome; but a thought
    Of that late death took all my heart for speech.


AN IRISH AIRMAN FORESEES HIS DEATH

    I know that I shall meet my fate
    Somewhere among the clouds above;
    Those that I fight I do not hate
    Those that I guard I do not love;
    My country is Kiltartan Cross,
    My countrymen Kiltartan's poor,
    No likely end could bring them loss
    Or leave them happier than before.
    Nor law, nor duty bade me fight,
    Nor public man, nor angry crowds,
    A lonely impulse of delight
    Drove to this tumult in the clouds;
    I balanced all, brought all to mind,
    The years to come seemed waste of breath,
    A waste of breath the years behind
    In balance with this life, this death.


MEN IMPROVE WITH THE YEARS

    I am worn out with dreams;
    A weather-worn, marble triton
    Among the streams;
    And all day long I look
    Upon this lady's beauty
    As though I had found in book
    A pictured beauty,
    Pleased to have filled the eyes
    Or the discerning ears,
    Delighted to be but wise,
    For men improve with the years;
    And yet and yet
    Is this my dream, or the truth?
    O would that we had met
    When I had my burning youth;
    But I grow old among dreams,
    A weather-worn, marble triton
    Among the streams.

THE COLLAR-BONE OF A HARE

    Would I could cast a sail on the water
    Where many a king has gone
    And many a king's daughter,
    And alight at the comely trees and the lawn,
    The playing upon pipes and the dancing,
    And learn that the best thing is
    To change my loves while dancing
    And pay but a kiss for a kiss.

    I would find by the edge of that water
    The collar-bone of a hare
    Worn thin by the lapping of water,
    And pierce it through with a gimlet and stare
    At the old bitter world where they marry in churches,
    And laugh over the untroubled water
    At all who marry in churches,
    Through the white thin bone of a hare.

UNDER THE ROUND TOWER

    `Although I'd lie lapped up in linen
    A deal I'd sweat and little earn
    If I should live as live the neighbours,`
    Cried the beggar, Billy Byrne;
    `Stretch bones till the daylight come
    On great-grandfather's battered tomb.`

    Upon a grey old battered tombstone
    In Glendalough beside the stream,
    Where the O'Byrnes and Byrnes are buried,
    He stretched his bones and fell in a dream
    Of sun and moon that a good hour
    Bellowed and pranced in the round tower;
    Of golden king and silver lady,
    Bellowing up and bellowing round,
    Till toes mastered a sweet measure,
    Mouth mastered a sweet sound,
    Prancing round and prancing up
    Until they pranced upon the top.

    That golden king and that wild lady
    Sang till stars began to fade,
    Hands gripped in hands, toes close together,
    Hair spread on the wind they made;
    That lady and that golden king
    Could like a brace of blackbirds sing.

    `It's certain that my luck is broken,`
    That rambling jailbird Billy said;
    `Before nightfall I'll pick a pocket
    And snug it in a feather-bed,
    I cannot find the peace of home
    On great-grandfather's battered tomb.`


SOLOMON TO SHEBA

    Sang Solomon to Sheba,
    And kissed her dusky face,
    `All day long from mid-day
    We have talked in the one place,
    All day long from shadowless noon
    We have gone round and round
    In the narrow theme of love
    Like an old horse in a pound.`

    To Solomon sang Sheba,
    Planted on his knees,
    `If you had broached a matter
    That might the learned please,
    You had before the sun had thrown
    Our shadows on the ground
    Discovered that my thoughts, not it,
    Are but a narrow pound.`

    Sang Solomon to Sheba,
    And kissed her Arab eyes,
    `There's not a man or woman
    Born under the skies
    Dare match in learning with us two,
    And all day long we have found
    There's not a thing but love can make
    The world a narrow pound.`


THE LIVING BEAUTY

    I'll say and maybe dream I have drawn content -- 
    Seeing that time has frozen up the blood,
    The wick of youth being burned and the oil spent -- 
    From beauty that is cast out of a mould
    In bronze, or that in dazzling marble appears,
    Appears, and when we have gone is gone again,
    Being more indifferent to our solitude
    Than 'twere an apparition. O heart, we are old,
    The living beauty is for younger men,
    We cannot pay its tribute of wild tears.


A SONG

    I thought no more was needed
    Youth to prolong
    Than dumb-bell and foil
    To keep the body young.
    Oh, who could have foretold
    That the heart grows old?

    Though I have many words,
    What woman's satisfied,
    I am no longer faint
    Because at her side?
    Oh, who could have foretold
    That the heart grows old?

    I have not lost desire
    But the heart that I had,
    I thought 'twould burn my body
    Laid on the death-bed.
    But who could have foretold
    That the heart grows old?



TO A YOUNG BEAUTY

    Dear fellow-artist, why so free
    With every sort of company,
    With every Jack and Jill?
    Choose your companions from the best;
    Who draws a bucket with the rest
    Soon topples down the hill.

    You may, that mirror for a school,
    Be passionate, not bountiful
    As common beauties may,
    Who were not born to keep in trim
    With old Ezekiel's cherubim
    But those of Beaujolet.

    I know what wages beauty gives,
    How hard a life her servant lives,
    Yet praise the winters gone;
    There is not a fool can call me friend,
    And I may dine at journey's end
    With Landor and with Donne.


TO A YOUNG GIRL

    My dear, my dear, I know
    More than another
    What makes your heart beat so;
    Not even your own mother
    Can know it as I know,
    Who broke my heart for her
    When the wild thought,
    That she denies
    And has forgot,
    Set all her blood astir
    And glittered in her eyes.

THE SCHOLARS

    Bald heads forgetful of their sins,
    Old, learned, respectable bald heads
    Edit and annotate the lines
    That young men, tossing on their beds,
    Rhymed out in love's despair
    To flatter beauty's ignorant ear.

    They'll cough in the ink to the world's end;
    Wear out the carpet with their shoes
    Earning respect; have no strange friend;
    If they have sinned nobody knows.
    Lord, what would they say
    Should their Catullus walk that way?


TOM O'ROUGHLEY

    `Though logic choppers rule the town,
    And every man and maid and boy
    Has marked a distant object down,
    An aimless joy is a pure joy,`
    Or so did Tom O'Roughley say
    That saw the surges running by,
    `And wisdom is a butterfly
    And not a gloomy bird of prey.

    `If little planned is little sinned
    But little need the grave distress.
    What's dying but a second wind?
    How but in zigzag wantonness
    Could trumpeter Michael be so brave?`
    Or something of that sort he said,
    `And if my dearest friend were dead
    I'd dance a measure on his grave.`


THE SAD SHEPHERD

SHEPHERD

That cry's from the first cuckoo of the year
I wished before it ceased.

GOATHERD

                  Nor bird nor beast
Could make me wish for anything this day,
Being old, but that the old alone might die,
And that would be against God's Providence.
Let the young wish. But what has brought you here?
Never until this moment have we met
Where my goats browse on the scarce grass or leap
From stone to stone.

SHEPHERD

      I am looking for strayed sheep;
Something has troubled me and in my trouble
I let them stray. I thought of rhyme alone,
For rhyme can beat a measure out of trouble
And make the daylight sweet once more; but when
I had driven every rhyme into its place
The sheep had gone from theirs.

GOATHERD

                    I know right well
What turned so good a shepherd from his charge.

SHEPHERD

He that was best in every country sport
And every country craft, and of us all
Most courteous to slow age and hasty youth
Is dead.

GOATHERD

      The boy that brings my griddle cake
Brought the bare news.

SHEPHERD

      He had thrown the crook away
And died in the great war beyond the sea.

GOATHERD

He had often played his pipes among my hills
And when he played it was their loneliness,
The exultation of their stone, that cried
Under his fingers.

SHEPHERD

          I had it from his mother,
And his own flock was browsing at the door.

GOATHERD

How does she bear her grief? There is not a shepherd
But grows more gentle when he speaks her name,
Remembering kindness done, and how can I,
That found when I had neither goat nor grazing
New welcome and old wisdom at her fire
Till winter blasts were gone, but speak of her
Even before his children and his wife.

SHEPHERD

She goes about her house erect and calm
Between the pantry and the linen chest,
Or else at meadow or at grazing overlooks
Her labouring men, as though her darling lived
But for her grandson now; there is no change
But such as I have seen upon her face
Watching our shepherd sports at harvest-time
When her son's turn was over.

GOATHERD

                    Sing your song,
I too have rhymed my reveries, but youth
Is hot to show whatever it has found
And till that's done can neither work nor wait.
Old goatherds and old goats, if in all else
Youth can excel them in accomplishment,
Are learned in waiting.

SHEPHERD

            You cannot but have seen
That he alone had gathered up no gear,
Set carpenters to work on no wide table,
On no long bench nor lofty milking shed
As others will, when first they take possession,
But left the house as in his father's time
As though he knew himself, as it were, a cuckoo,
No settled man. And now that he is gone
There's nothing of him left but half a score
Of sorrowful, austere, sweet, lofty pipe tunes.

GOATHERD

You have put the thought in rhyme.

SHEPHERD

                  I worked all day
And when 'twas done so little had I done
That maybe `I am sorry` in plain prose
Had sounded better to your mountain fancy.

_He sings._

`Like the speckled bird that steers
Thousands of leagues oversea,
And runs for a while or a while half-flies
Upon his yellow legs through our meadows,
He stayed for a while; and we
Had scarcely accustomed our ears
To his speech at the break of day,
Had scarcely accustomed our eyes
To his shape in the lengthening shadows,
Where the sheep are thrown in the pool,
When he vanished from ears and eyes.
I had wished a dear thing on that day
I heard him first, but man is a fool.`

GOATHERD

You sing as always of the natural life,
And I that made like music in my youth
Hearing it now have sighed for that young man
And certain lost companions of my own.

SHEPHERD

They say that on your barren mountain ridge
You have measured out the road that the soul treads
When it has vanished from our natural eyes;
That you have talked with apparitions.

GOATHERD

                          Indeed
My daily thoughts since the first stupor of youth
Have found the path my goats' feet cannot find.

SHEPHERD

Sing, for it may be that your thoughts have plucked
Some medicable herb to make our grief
Less bitter.

GOATHERD

    They have brought me from that ridge
Seed pods and flowers that are not all wild poppy.

_Sings._

`He grows younger every second
That were all his birthdays reckoned
Much too solemn seemed;
Because of what he had dreamed,
Or the ambitions that he served,
Much too solemn and reserved.
Jaunting, journeying
To his own dayspring,
He unpacks the loaded pern
Of all 'twas pain or joy to learn,
Of all that he had made.
The outrageous war shall fade;
At some old winding whitethorn root
He'll practice on the shepherd's flute,
Or on the close-cropped grass
Court his shepherd lass,
Or run where lads reform our day-time
Till that is their long shouting play-time;
Knowledge he shall unwind
Through victories of the mind,
Till, clambering at the cradle side,
He dreams himself his mother's pride,
All knowledge lost in trance
Of sweeter ignorance.`

SHEPHERD

When I have shut these ewes and this old ram
Into the fold, we'll to the woods and there
Cut out our rhymes on strips of new-torn bark
But put no name and leave them at her door.
To know the mountain and the valley grieve
May be a quiet thought to wife and mother,
And children when they spring up shoulder high.


LINES WRITTEN IN DEJECTION

    When have I last looked on
    The round green eyes and the long wavering bodies
    Of the dark leopards of the moon?
    All the wild witches those most noble ladies,
    For all their broom-sticks and their tears,
    Their angry tears, are gone.
    The holy centaurs of the hills are banished;
    And I have nothing but harsh sun;
    Heroic mother moon has vanished,
    And now that I have come to fifty years
    I must endure the timid sun.


THE DAWN

    I would be ignorant as the dawn
    That has looked down
    On that old queen measuring a town
    With the pin of a brooch,
    Or on the withered men that saw
    From their pedantic Babylon
    The careless planets in their courses,
    The stars fade out where the moon comes,
    And took their tablets and did sums;
    I would be ignorant as the dawn
    That merely stood, rocking the glittering coach
    Above the cloudy shoulders of the horses;
    I would be -- for no knowledge is worth a straw -- 
    Ignorant and wanton as the dawn.


ON WOMAN

    May God be praised for woman
    That gives up all her mind,
    A man may find in no man
    A friendship of her kind
    That covers all he has brought
    As with her flesh and bone,
    Nor quarrels with a thought
    Because it is not her own.

    Though pedantry denies
    It's plain the Bible means
    That Solomon grew wise
    While talking with his queens.
    Yet never could, although
    They say he counted grass,
    Count all the praises due
    When Sheba was his lass,
    When she the iron wrought, or
    When from the smithy fire
    It shuddered in the water:
    Harshness of their desire
    That made them stretch and yawn,
    Pleasure that comes with sleep,
    Shudder that made them one.
    What else He give or keep
    God grant me -- no, not here,
    For I am not so bold
    To hope a thing so dear
    Now I am growing old,
    But when if the tale's true
    The Pestle of the moon
    That pounds up all anew
    Brings me to birth again -- 
    To find what once I had
    And know what once I have known,
    Until I am driven mad,
    Sleep driven from my bed,
    By tenderness and care,
    Pity, an aching head,
    Gnashing of teeth, despair;
    And all because of some one
    Perverse creature of chance,
    And live like Solomon
    That Sheba led a dance.


THE FISHERMAN

    Although I can see him still,
    The freckled man who goes
    To a grey place on a hill
    In grey Connemara clothes
    At dawn to cast his flies,
    It's long since I began
    To call up to the eyes
    This wise and simple man.
    All day I'd looked in the face
    What I had hoped 'twould be
    To write for my own race
    And the reality;
    The living men that I hate,
    The dead man that I loved,
    The craven man in his seat,
    The insolent unreproved,
    And no knave brought to book
    Who has won a drunken cheer,
    The witty man and his joke
    Aimed at the commonest ear,
    The clever man who cries
    The catch-cries of the clown,
    The beating down of the wise
    And great Art beaten down.

    Maybe a twelvemonth since
    Suddenly I began,
    In scorn of this audience,
    Imagining a man
    And his sun-freckled face,
    And grey Connemara cloth,
    Climbing up to a place
    Where stone is dark under froth,
    And the down turn of his wrist
    When the flies drop in the stream:
    A man who does not exist,
    A man who is but a dream;
    And cried, `Before I am old
    I shall have written him one
    Poem maybe as cold
    And passionate as the dawn.`


THE HAWK

    `Call down the hawk from the air;
    Let him be hooded or caged
    Till the yellow eye has grown mild,
    For larder and spit are bare,
    The old cook enraged,
    The scullion gone wild.`

    `I will not be clapped in a hood,
    Nor a cage, nor alight upon wrist,
    Now I have learnt to be proud
    Hovering over the wood
    In the broken mist
    Or tumbling cloud.`

    `What tumbling cloud did you cleave,
    Yellow-eyed hawk of the mind,
    Last evening? that I, who had sat
    Dumbfounded before a knave,
    Should give to my friend
    A pretence of wit.`


MEMORY

    One had a lovely face,
    And two or three had charm,
    But charm and face were in vain
    Because the mountain grass
    Cannot but keep the form
    Where the mountain hare has lain.

HER PRAISE

    She is foremost of those that I would hear praised.
    I have gone about the house, gone up and down
    As a man does who has published a new book
    Or a young girl dressed out in her new gown,
    And though I have turned the talk by hook or crook
    Until her praise should be the uppermost theme,
    A woman spoke of some new tale she had read,
    A man confusedly in a half dream
    As though some other name ran in his head.
    She is foremost of those that I would hear praised.
    I will talk no more of books or the long war
    But walk by the dry thorn until I have found
    Some beggar sheltering from the wind, and there
    Manage the talk until her name come round.
    If there be rags enough he will know her name
    And be well pleased remembering it, for in the old days,
    Though she had young men's praise and old men's blame,
    Among the poor both old and young gave her praise.


THE PEOPLE

    `What have I earned for all that work,` I said,
    `For all that I have done at my own charge?
    The daily spite of this unmannerly town,
    Where who has served the most is most defamed,
    The reputation of his lifetime lost
    Between the night and morning. I might have lived,
    And you know well how great the longing has been,
    Where every day my footfall should have lit
    In the green shadow of Ferrara wall;
    Or climbed among the images of the past -- 
    The unperturbed and courtly images -- 
    Evening and morning, the steep street of Urbino
    To where the duchess and her people talked
    The stately midnight through until they stood
    In their great window looking at the dawn;
    I might have had no friend that could not mix
    Courtesy and passion into one like those
    That saw the wicks grow yellow in the dawn;
    I might have used the one substantial right
    My trade allows: chosen my company,
    And chosen what scenery had pleased me best.`
    Thereon my phoenix answered in reproof,
    `The drunkards, pilferers of public funds,
    All the dishonest crowd I had driven away,
    When my luck changed and they dared meet my face,
    Crawled from obscurity, and set upon me
    Those I had served and some that I had fed;
    Yet never have I, now nor any time,
    Complained of the people.`

                      All I could reply
    Was: `You, that have not lived in thought but deed,
    Can have the purity of a natural force,
    But I, whose virtues are the definitions
    Of the analytic mind, can neither close
    The eye of the mind nor keep my tongue from speech.`
    And yet, because my heart leaped at her words,
    I was abashed, and now they come to mind
    After nine years, I sink my head abashed.


HIS PHOENIX

    There is a queen in China, or maybe it's in Spain,
    And birthdays and holidays such praises can be heard
    Of her unblemished lineaments, a whiteness with no stain,
    That she might be that sprightly girl who was trodden by a bird;
    And there's a score of duchesses, surpassing womankind,
    Or who have found a painter to make them so for pay
    And smooth out stain and blemish with the elegance of his mind:
    I knew a phoenix in my youth so let them have their day.

    The young men every night applaud their Gaby's laughing eye,
    And Ruth St. Denis had more charm although she had poor luck,
    From nineteen hundred nine or ten, Pavlova's had the cry,
    And there's a player in the States who gathers up her cloak
    And flings herself out of the room when Juliet would be bride
    With all a woman's passion, a child's imperious way,
    And there are -- but no matter if there are scores beside:
    I knew a phoenix in my youth so let them have their day.

    There's Margaret and Marjorie and Dorothy and Nan,
    A Daphne and a Mary who live in privacy;
    One's had her fill of lovers, another's had but one,
    Another boasts, `I pick and choose and have but two or three.`
    If head and limb have beauty and the instep's high and light,
    They can spread out what sail they please for all I have to say,
    Be but the breakers of men's hearts or engines of delight:
    I knew a phoenix in my youth so let them have their day.

    There'll be that crowd to make men wild through all the centuries,
    And maybe there'll be some young belle walk out to make men wild
    Who is my beauty's equal, though that my heart denies,
    But not the exact likeness, the simplicity of a child,
    And that proud look as though she had gazed into the burning sun,
    And all the shapely body no tittle gone astray,
    I mourn for that most lonely thing; and yet God's will be done,
    I knew a phoenix in my youth so let them have their day.


A THOUGHT FROM PROPERTIUS

    She might, so noble from head
    To great shapely knees,
    The long flowing line,
    Have walked to the altar
    Through the holy images
    At Pallas Athene's side,
    Or been fit spoil for a centaur
    Drunk with the unmixed wine.


BROKEN DREAMS

    There is grey in your hair.
    Young men no longer suddenly catch their breath
    When you are passing;
    But maybe some old gaffer mutters a blessing
    Because it was your prayer
    Recovered him upon the bed of death.
    For your sole sake -- that all heart's ache have known,
    And given to others all heart's ache,
    From meagre girlhood's putting on
    Burdensome beauty -- for your sole sake
    Heaven has put away the stroke of her doom,
    So great her portion in that peace you make
    By merely walking in a room.

    Your beauty can but leave among us
    Vague memories, nothing but memories.
    A young man when the old men are done talking
    Will say to an old man, `Tell me of that lady
    The poet stubborn with his passion sang us
    When age might well have chilled his blood.`

    Vague memories, nothing but memories,
    But in the grave all, all, shall be renewed.
    The certainty that I shall see that lady
    Leaning or standing or walking
    In the first loveliness of womanhood,
    And with the fervour of my youthful eyes,
    Has set me muttering like a fool.

    You are more beautiful than any one
    And yet your body had a flaw:
    Your small hands were not beautiful,
    And I am afraid that you will run
    And paddle to the wrist
    In that mysterious, always brimming lake
    Where those that have obeyed the holy law
    Paddle and are perfect; leave unchanged
    The hands that I have kissed
    For old sakes' sake.

    The last stroke of midnight dies.
    All day in the one chair
    From dream to dream and rhyme to rhyme I have ranged
    In rambling talk with an image of air:
    Vague memories, nothing but memories.


A DEEP-SWORN VOW

    Others because you did not keep
    That deep-sworn vow have been friends of mine;
    Yet always when I look death in the face,
    When I clamber to the heights of sleep,
    Or when I grow excited with wine,
    Suddenly I meet your face.


PRESENCES

    This night has been so strange that it seemed
    As if the hair stood up on my head.
    From going-down of the sun I have dreamed
    That women laughing, or timid or wild,
    In rustle of lace or silken stuff,
    Climbed up my creaking stair. They had read
    All I had rhymed of that monstrous thing
    Returned and yet unrequited love.
    They stood in the door and stood between
    My great wood lecturn and the fire
    Till I could hear their hearts beating:
    One is a harlot, and one a child
    That never looked upon man with desire,
    And one it may be a queen.


THE BALLOON OF THE MIND

    Hands, do what you're bid;
    Bring the balloon of the mind
    That bellies and drags in the wind
    Into its narrow shed.


TO A SQUIRREL AT KYLE-NA-GNO

    Come play with me;
    Why should you run
    Through the shaking tree
    As though I'd a gun
    To strike you dead?
    When all I would do
    Is to scratch your head
    And let you go.


ON BEING ASKED FOR A WAR POEM

    I think it better that in times like these
    A poet keep his mouth shut, for in truth
    We have no gift to set a statesman right;
    He has had enough of meddling who can please
    A young girl in the indolence of her youth,
    Or an old man upon a winter's night.


IN MEMORY OF ALFRED POLLEXFEN

    Five-and-twenty years have gone
    Since old William Pollexfen
    Laid his strong bones down in death
    By his wife Elizabeth
    In the grey stone tomb he made.
    And after twenty years they laid
    In that tomb by him and her,
    His son George, the astrologer;
    And Masons drove from miles away
    To scatter the Acacia spray
    Upon a melancholy man
    Who had ended where his breath began.
    Many a son and daughter lies
    Far from the customary skies,
    The Mall and Eades's grammar school,
    In London or in Liverpool;
    But where is laid the sailor John?
    That so many lands had known:
    Quiet lands or unquiet seas
    Where the Indians trade or Japanese.
    He never found his rest ashore,
    Moping for one voyage more.
    Where have they laid the sailor John?

    And yesterday the youngest son,
    A humorous, unambitious man,
    Was buried near the astrologer;
    And are we now in the tenth year?
    Since he, who had been contented long,
    A nobody in a great throng,
    Decided he would journey home,
    Now that his fiftieth year had come,
    And `Mr. Alfred` be again
    Upon the lips of common men
    Who carried in their memory
    His childhood and his family.
    At all these death-beds women heard
    A visionary white sea-bird
    Lamenting that a man should die;
    And with that cry I have raised my cry.

UPON A DYING LADY


HER COURTESY

    With the old kindness, the old distinguished grace
    She lies, her lovely piteous head amid dull red hair
    Propped upon pillows, rouge on the pallor of her face.
    She would not have us sad because she is lying there,
    And when she meets our gaze her eyes are laughter-lit,
    Her speech a wicked tale that we may vie with her
    Matching our broken-hearted wit against her wit,
    Thinking of saints and of Petronius Arbiter.


CERTAIN ARTISTS BRING HER DOLLS AND DRAWINGS

    Bring where our Beauty lies
    A new modelled doll, or drawing,
    With a friend's or an enemy's
    Features, or maybe showing
    Her features when a tress
    Of dull red hair was flowing
    Over some silken dress
    Cut in the Turkish fashion,
    Or it may be like a boy's.
    We have given the world our passion
    We have naught for death but toys.


SHE TURNS THE DOLLS' FACES TO THE WALL

    Because to-day is some religious festival
    They had a priest say Mass, and even the Japanese,
    Heel up and weight on toe, must face the wall
    -- Pedant in passion, learned in old courtesies,
    Vehement and witty she had seemed -- ; the Venetian lady
    Who had seemed to glide to some intrigue in her red shoes,
    Her domino, her panniered skirt copied from Longhi;
    The meditative critic; all are on their toes,
    Even our Beauty with her Turkish trousers on.
    Because the priest must have like every dog his day
    Or keep us all awake with baying at the moon,
    We and our dolls being but the world were best away.


THE END OF DAY

    She is playing like a child
    And penance is the play,
    Fantastical and wild
    Because the end of day
    Shows her that some one soon
    Will come from the house, and say -- 
    Though play is but half-done -- 
    `Come in and leave the play.` -- 


HER RACE

    She has not grown uncivil
    As narrow natures would
    And called the pleasures evil
    Happier days thought good;
    She knows herself a woman
    No red and white of a face,
    Or rank, raised from a common
    Unreckonable race;
    And how should her heart fail her
    Or sickness break her will
    With her dead brother's valour
    For an example still.


HER COURAGE

    When her soul flies to the predestined dancing-place
    (I have no speech but symbol, the pagan speech I made
    Amid the dreams of youth) let her come face to face,
    While wondering still to be a shade, with Grania's shade
    All but the perils of the woodland flight forgot
    That made her Dermuid dear, and some old cardinal
    Pacing with half-closed eyelids in a sunny spot
    Who had murmured of Giorgione at his latest breath -- 
    Aye and Achilles, Timor, Babar, Barhaim, all
    Who have lived in joy and laughed into the face of Death.


HER FRIENDS BRING HER A CHRISTMAS TREE

    Pardon, great enemy,
    Without an angry thought
    We've carried in our tree,
    And here and there have bought
    Till all the boughs are gay,
    And she may look from the bed
    On pretty things that may
    Please a fantastic head.
    Give her a little grace,
    What if a laughing eye
    Have looked into your face -- 
    It is about to die.





EGO DOMINUS TUUS


HIC

On the grey sand beside the shallow stream
Under your old wind-beaten tower, where still
A lamp burns on beside the open book
That Michael Robartes left, you walk in the moon
And though you have passed the best of life still trace
Enthralled by the unconquerable delusion
Magical shapes.

ILLE

              By the help of an image
I call to my own opposite, summon all
That I have handled least, least looked upon.

HIC

And I would find myself and not an image.

ILLE

That is our modern hope and by its light
We have lit upon the gentle, sensitive mind
And lost the old nonchalance of the hand;
Whether we have chosen chisel, pen or brush
We are but critics, or but half create,
Timid, entangled, empty and abashed
Lacking the countenance of our friends.

HIC

                            And yet
The chief imagination of Christendom
Dante Alighieri so utterly found himself
That he has made that hollow face of his
More plain to the mind's eye than any face
But that of Christ.

ILLE

            And did he find himself,
Or was the hunger that had made it hollow
A hunger for the apple on the bough
Most out of reach? and is that spectral image
The man that Lapo and that Guido knew?
I think he fashioned from his opposite
An image that might have been a stony face,
Staring upon a bedouin's horse-hair roof
From doored and windowed cliff, or half upturned
Among the coarse grass and the camel dung.
He set his chisel to the hardest stone.
Being mocked by Guido for his lecherous life,
Derided and deriding, driven out
To climb that stair and eat that bitter bread,
He found the unpersuadable justice, he found
The most exalted lady loved by a man.

HIC

Yet surely there are men who have made their art
Out of no tragic war, lovers of life,
Impulsive men that look for happiness
And sing when they have found it.

ILLE

                        No, not sing,
For those that love the world serve it in action,
Grow rich, popular and full of influence,
And should they paint or write still it is action:
The struggle of the fly in marmalade.
The rhetorician would deceive his neighbours,
The sentimentalist himself; while art
Is but a vision of reality.
What portion in the world can the artist have
Who has awakened from the common dream
But dissipation and despair?

HIC

                          And yet
No one denies to Keats love of the world;
Remember his deliberate happiness.

ILLE

His art is happy but who knows his mind?
I see a schoolboy when I think of him,
With face and nose pressed to a sweet-shop window,
For certainly he sank into his grave
His senses and his heart unsatisfied,
And made -- being poor, ailing and ignorant,
Shut out from all the luxury of the world,
The coarse-bred son of a livery stable-keeper -- 
Luxuriant song.

HIC

      Why should you leave the lamp
Burning alone beside an open book,
And trace these characters upon the sands;
A style is found by sedentary toil
And by the imitation of great masters.

ILLE

Because I seek an image, not a book.
Those men that in their writings are most wise
Own nothing but their blind, stupefied hearts.
I call to the mysterious one who yet
Shall walk the wet sands by the edge of the stream
And look most like me, being indeed my double,
And prove of all imaginable things
The most unlike, being my anti-self,
And standing by these characters disclose
All that I seek; and whisper it as though
He were afraid the birds, who cry aloud
Their momentary cries before it is dawn,
Would carry it away to blasphemous men.



A PRAYER ON GOING INTO MY HOUSE

    God grant a blessing on this tower and cottage
    And on my heirs, if all remain unspoiled,
    No table, or chair or stool not simple enough
    For shepherd lads in Galilee; and grant
    That I myself for portions of the year
    May handle nothing and set eyes on nothing
    But what the great and passionate have used
    Throughout so many varying centuries.
    We take it for the norm; yet should I dream
    Sinbad the sailor's brought a painted chest,
    Or image, from beyond the Loadstone Mountain
    That dream is a norm; and should some limb of the devil
    Destroy the view by cutting down an ash
    That shades the road, or setting up a cottage
    Planned in a government office, shorten his life,
    Manacle his soul upon the Red Sea bottom.


THE PHASES OF THE MOON

_An old man cocked his ear upon a bridge;
He and his friend, their faces to the South,
Had trod the uneven road. Their boots were soiled,
Their Connemara cloth worn out of shape;
They had kept a steady pace as though their beds,
Despite a dwindling and late risen moon,
Were distant. An old man cocked his ear._

AHERNE

What made that sound?

ROBARTES

                  A rat or water-hen
Splashed, or an otter slid into the stream.
We are on the bridge; that shadow is the tower,
And the light proves that he is reading still.
He has found, after the manner of his kind,
Mere images; chosen this place to live in
Because, it may be, of the candle light
From the far tower where Milton's platonist
Sat late, or Shelley's visionary prince:
The lonely light that Samuel Palmer engraved,
An image of mysterious wisdom won by toil;
And now he seeks in book or manuscript
What he shall never find.

AHERNE

                 Why should not you
Who know it all ring at his door, and speak
Just truth enough to show that his whole life
Will scarcely find for him a broken crust
Of all those truths that are your daily bread;
And when you have spoken take the roads again?

ROBARTES

He wrote of me in that extravagant style
He had learnt from Pater, and to round his tale
Said I was dead; and dead I chose to be.

AHERNE

Sing me the changes of the moon once more;
True song, though speech: `mine author sung it me.`

ROBARTES

Twenty-and-eight the phases of the moon,
The full and the moon's dark and all the crescents,
Twenty-and-eight, and yet but six-and-twenty
The cradles that a man must needs be rocked in:
For there's no human life at the full or the dark.
From the first crescent to the half, the dream
But summons to adventure and the man
Is always happy like a bird or a beast;
But while the moon is rounding towards the full
He follows whatever whim's most difficult
Among whims not impossible, and though scarred
As with the cat-o'-nine-tails of the mind,
His body moulded from within his body
Grows comelier. Eleven pass, and then
Athenae takes Achilles by the hair,
Hector is in the dust, Nietzsche is born,
Because the heroes' crescent is the twelfth.
And yet, twice born, twice buried, grow he must,
Before the full moon, helpless as a worm.
The thirteenth moon but sets the soul at war
In its own being, and when that war's begun
There is no muscle in the arm; and after
Under the frenzy of the fourteenth moon
The soul begins to tremble into stillness,
To die into the labyrinth of itself!

AHERNE

Sing out the song; sing to the end, and sing
The strange reward of all that discipline.

ROBARTES

All thought becomes an image and the soul
Becomes a body: that body and that soul
Too perfect at the full to lie in a cradle,
Too lonely for the traffic of the world:
Body and soul cast out and cast away
Beyond the visible world.

AHERNE

               All dreams of the soul
End in a beautiful man's or woman's body.

ROBARTES

Have you not always known it?

AHERNE

               The song will have it
That those that we have loved got their long fingers
From death, and wounds, or on Sinai's top,
Or from some bloody whip in their own hands.
They ran from cradle to cradle till at last
Their beauty dropped out of the loneliness
Of body and soul.

ROBARTES

              The lovers' heart knows that.

AHERNE

It must be that the terror in their eyes
Is memory or foreknowledge of the hour
When all is fed with light and heaven is bare.

ROBARTES

When the moon's full those creatures of the full
Are met on the waste hills by country men
Who shudder and hurry by: body and soul
Estranged amid the strangeness of themselves,
Caught up in contemplation, the mind's eye
Fixed upon images that once were thought,
For separate, perfect, and immovable
Images can break the solitude
Of lovely, satisfied, indifferent eyes.

_And thereupon with aged, high-pitched voice
Aherne laughed, thinking of the man within,
His sleepless candle and laborious pen._

ROBARTES

And after that the crumbling of the moon.
The soul remembering its loneliness
Shudders in many cradles; all is changed,
It would be the World's servant, and as it serves,
Choosing whatever task's most difficult
Among tasks not impossible, it takes
Upon the body and upon the soul
The coarseness of the drudge.

AHERNE

                     Before the full
It sought itself and afterwards the world.

ROBARTES

Because you are forgotten, half out of life,
And never wrote a book your thought is clear.
Reformer, merchant, statesman, learned man,
Dutiful husband, honest wife by turn,
Cradle upon cradle, and all in flight and all
Deformed because there is no deformity
But saves us from a dream.

AHERNE

                    And what of those
That the last servile crescent has set free?

ROBARTES

Because all dark, like those that are all light,
They are cast beyond the verge, and in a cloud,
Crying to one another like the bats;
And having no desire they cannot tell
What's good or bad, or what it is to triumph
At the perfection of one's own obedience;
And yet they speak what's blown into the mind;
Deformed beyond deformity, unformed,
Insipid as the dough before it is baked,
They change their bodies at a word.

AHERNE

                     And then?

ROBARTES

When all the dough has been so kneaded up
That it can take what form cook Nature fancy
The first thin crescent is wheeled round once more.

AHERNE

But the escape; the song's not finished yet.

ROBARTES

Hunchback and saint and fool are the last crescents.
The burning bow that once could shoot an arrow
Out of the up and down, the wagon wheel
Of beauty's cruelty and wisdom's chatter,
Out of that raving tide is drawn betwixt
Deformity of body and of mind.

AHERNE

Were not our beds far off I'd ring the bell,
Stand under the rough roof-timbers of the hall
Beside the castle door, where all is stark
Austerity, a place set out for wisdom
That he will never find; I'd play a part;
He would never know me after all these years
But take me for some drunken country man;
I'd stand and mutter there until he caught
`Hunchback and saint and fool,` and that they came
Under the three last crescents of the moon,
And then I'd stagger out. He'd crack his wits
Day after day, yet never find the meaning.

_And then he laughed to think that what seemed hard
Should be so simple -- a bat rose from the hazels
And circled round him with its squeaky cry,
The light in the tower window was put out._



THE CAT AND THE MOON

    The cat went here and there
    And the moon spun round like a top,
    And the nearest kin of the moon
    The creeping cat looked up.
    Black Minnaloushe stared at the moon,
    For wander and wail as he would
    The pure cold light in the sky
    Troubled his animal blood.
    Minnaloushe runs in the grass,
    Lifting his delicate feet.
    Do you dance, Minnaloushe, do you dance?
    When two close kindred meet
    What better than call a dance,
    Maybe the moon may learn,
    Tired of that courtly fashion,
    A new dance turn.
    Minnaloushe creeps through the grass
    From moonlit place to place,
    The sacred moon overhead
    Has taken a new phase.
    Does Minnaloushe know that his pupils
    Will pass from change to change,
    And that from round to crescent,
    From crescent to round they range?
    Minnaloushe creeps through the grass
    Alone, important and wise,
    And lifts to the changing moon
    His changing eyes.


THE SAINT AND THE HUNCHBACK

HUNCHBACK

Stand up and lift your hand and bless
A man that finds great bitterness
In thinking of his lost renown.
A Roman Caesar is held down
Under this hump.

SAINT

                    God tries each man
According to a different plan.
I shall not cease to bless because
I lay about me with the taws
That night and morning I may thrash
Greek Alexander from my flesh,
Augustus Caesar, and after these
That great rogue Alcibiades.

HUNCHBACK

To all that in your flesh have stood
And blessed, I give my gratitude,
Honoured by all in their degrees,
But most to Alcibiades.


TWO SONGS OF A FOOL


    A speckled cat and a tame hare
    Eat at my hearthstone
    And sleep there;
    And both look up to me alone
    For learning and defence
    As I look up to Providence.

    I start out of my sleep to think
    Some day I may forget
    Their food and drink;
    Or, the house door left unshut,
    The hare may run till it's found
    The horn's sweet note and the tooth of the hound.

    I bear a burden that might well try
    Men that do all by rule,
    And what can I
    That am a wandering witted fool
    But pray to God that He ease
    My great responsibilities.


    I slept on my three-legged stool by the fire,
    The speckled cat slept on my knee;
    We never thought to enquire
    Where the brown hare might be,
    And whether the door were shut.
    Who knows how she drank the wind
    Stretched up on two legs from the mat,
    Before she had settled her mind
    To drum with her heel and to leap:
    Had I but awakened from sleep
    And called her name she had heard,
    It may be, and had not stirred,
    That now, it may be, has found
    The horn's sweet note and the tooth of the hound.


ANOTHER SONG OF A FOOL

    This great purple butterfly,
    In the prison of my hands,
    Has a learning in his eye
    Not a poor fool understands.

    Once he lived a schoolmaster
    With a stark, denying look,
    A string of scholars went in fear
    Of his great birch and his great book.

    Like the clangour of a bell,
    Sweet and harsh, harsh and sweet,
    That is how he learnt so well
    To take the roses for his meat.


THE DOUBLE VISION OF MICHAEL ROBARTES

    On the grey rock of Cashel the mind's eye
    Has called up the cold spirits that are born
    When the old moon is vanished from the sky
    And the new still hides her horn.

    Under blank eyes and fingers never still
    The particular is pounded till it is man,
    When had I my own will?
    Oh, not since life began.

    Constrained, arraigned, baffled, bent and unbent
    By these wire-jointed jaws and limbs of wood,
    Themselves obedient,
    Knowing not evil and good;

    Obedient to some hidden magical breath.
    They do not even feel, so abstract are they,
    So dead beyond our death,
    Triumph that we obey.


    On the grey rock of Cashel I suddenly saw
    A Sphinx with woman breast and lion paw,
    A Buddha, hand at rest,
    Hand lifted up that blest;

    And right between these two a girl at play
    That it may be had danced her life away,
    For now being dead it seemed
    That she of dancing dreamed.

    Although I saw it all in the mind's eye
    There can be nothing solider till I die;
    I saw by the moon's light
    Now at its fifteenth night.

    One lashed her tail; her eyes lit by the moon
    Gazed upon all things known, all things unknown,
    In triumph of intellect
    With motionless head erect.

    That other's moonlit eyeballs never moved,
    Being fixed on all things loved, all things unloved,
    Yet little peace he had
    For those that love are sad.

    Oh, little did they care who danced between,
    And little she by whom her dance was seen
    So that she danced. No thought,
    Body perfection brought,

    For what but eye and ear silence the mind
    With the minute particulars of mankind?
    Mind moved yet seemed to stop
    As 'twere a spinning-top.

    In contemplation had those three so wrought
    Upon a moment, and so stretched it out
    That they, time overthrown,
    Were dead yet flesh and bone.


    I knew that I had seen, had seen at last
    That girl my unremembering nights hold fast
    Or else my dreams that fly,
    If I should rub an eye,

    And yet in flying fling into my meat
    A crazy juice that makes the pulses beat
    As though I had been undone
    By Homer's Paragon

    Who never gave the burning town a thought;
    To such a pitch of folly I am brought,
    Being caught between the pull
    Of the dark moon and the full,

    The commonness of thought and images
    That have the frenzy of our Western seas.
    Thereon I made my moan,
    And after kissed a stone,

    And after that arranged it in a song
    Seeing that I, ignorant for so long,
    Had been rewarded thus
    In Cormac's ruined house.

SINGERIE


    Summer afternoon in Hell!
    Down the empty street it fell,
    Pantaloon and Scaramouche -- 
    Tongues like flames and shadows louche -- 
    Flickered down the street together
    In the spangled weather.
    Flames, bright singing-birds that pass,
    Whistled wares as shrill as grass
    (Landscapes clear as glittering glass),
    Whistled all together:
    Papagei, oh Papagei,
    Buy our greenest fruits, oh buy,
    Melons misty from the bloom
    Of mellow moons on some hot night,
    Melting in the August light;
    Apples like an emerald shower;
    Nectarines that falling boom
    On the grass in greenest gloom;
    Peaches bright as parrot's feather
    Glistening from the moon's bower;
    Chequered like fritillaries,
    Fat and red are strawberries.
    Parrot-voices shrill together -- 
    Now they pelt each monkey-face
    (Pantaloon with simian grace)
    From the soft gloom till they smother
    Both the plumed head-dresses
    With the green fruit-gems that glitter
    (Twinkling sharp sounds like a zither).
    Sharp each bird-tongue shrills and hisses,
    Parrot-voices shrieking bane; -- 
    Down comes every spangled shutter
    With a sudden noise like rain.




THE AVENUE


    In the huge and glassy room,
    Pantaloon, with his tail-feather
    Spangled like the weather,
    Panached, too, with many a plume,
    Watched the monkey Fanfreluche,
    Shivering in his gilded ruche,
    Fawn upon the piano keys -- 
    Flatter till they answer back,
    Through the scale of centuries,
    Difference between white and black.
    Winds like hurricanes of light
    Change the blackest vacuums
    To a light-barred avenue -- 
    Semitones of might and right;
    Then, from matter, life comes.
    Down that lengthy avenue
    Leading us we know not where,
    Sudden views creep through the air;
    Oh the keys we stumble through!
    Jungles splashed with violent light,
    Promenades all hard and bright,
    Long tails like the swish of seas,
    Avenue of piano keys.
    Meaning comes to bind the whole,
    Fingers separate from thumbs,
    Soon the shapeless tune comes:
    Bestial efforts at man's soul.
    What though notes are false and shrill -- 
    Black streets tumbling down a hill?
    Fundamentally
    I am you, and you are me -- 
    Octaves fall as emptily.




MANDOLINE


    Down in Hell's gilded street,
    Snow dances fleet and sweet,
    Bright as a parokeet,

    Or Punchinello,
    All glistening yellow,
    As fruit-jewels mellow,

    Glittering white and black
    As the swan's glassy back
    On the Styx' soundless track,

    Sharp as bird's painted bill,
    Pecking fruit, sweet and shrill,
    On a dark window-sill.

    See the glass house as smooth
    As a wide puppet-booth ...
    Snow strikes it like a sooth

    Melon-shaped mandoline
    With the sharp tang and sheen
    Of flames that cry, Unclean!

    Dinah with scarlet ruche,
    Gay-plumaged Fanfreluche,
    Watch shrill as Scaramouche

    In the huge house of glass
    Old shadows bent, alas!
    On ebon sticks now pass -- 

    Lean on a nigger boy
    Creep like a broken toy -- 
    Wooden and painted joy.

    Trains sweep the empty floors -- 
    Pelongs and Pallampores,
    Bulchauls and Sallampores,

    Soundless as any breeze
    (Amber and orangeries)
    From isles in Indian seas.

    Black spangled veils falling
    (The cold is appalling),
    They wave fans, hear calling

    Adder-flames shrieking slow,
    Stinging bright fruit-like snow,
    Down in the street below;

    While an ape, with black spangled veil,
    Plum'd head-dress, face dust-pale,
    Scratch'd with a finger-nail

    Sounds from a mandoline,
    Tuneless and sharp as sin: -- 
    Shutters whose tang and sheen,

    Shrieking all down the scale,
    Seem like the flames that fail
    Under that onyx nail,

    Light as snow dancing fleet,
    Bright as a parokeet,
    Down in Hell's empty street.




COMEDY FOR MARIONETTES

    Tang the sharp mandoline!
    Hail, falling in the lean
    Street of Hell, sweeps it clean.

    Under the puppet booth,
    Down in Hell, see the smooth
    Snow bright as fruit and sooth.

    Cherries and plums all freeze -- 
    Rubies upon the trees,
    Rubied hail falls through these,

    Pelting each young Snow Queen -- 
    (A swan's breath, so whitely seen,)
    Flirting her fan in lean

    Streets, passing to and fro,
    White as the flamelike snow,
    Fruit of lips all aglow

    As isles of the cherry
    Or ruby-sweet berry
    All plump sweet and merry.

    Mantillas hide the shame
    Of each duenna dame,
    (Fans made of plumes of flame,)

    Pelted with coral bells
    Out of the orchard hells,
    (Hail with sweet fruitage smells).

    Now on the platform seen,
    Hoofs clatter with the clean
    Sound of a mandoline....

    Under the tinsel sun,
    See shadow-spiders run! -- 
    Fatter than any bun,

    Beelzebub in a chair
    Sits on the platform there;
    Candles like cold eyes stare.

    Master has got the gout,
    Adder-flames flare and spout
    From his lips ... shadows rout.

    Tiptoe the Barber crept,
    On his furred black locks leapt.
    Candles shrieked, flaring wept.

    Barber takes up the shears....
    Fur for the shivering fears,
    Cold in Hell these long years.

    Candles shriek up the scale,
    Creaking down in a wail.
    Hear how their protests fail!

    Only cold, snakish flutes
    Sound like the growing fruits
    Out of slow hidden roots....

    Strange eyes a moment stare,
    Fruit-like and moon-like glare,
    From the bright shutters where

    Hail, falling in the lean
    Street of Hell, sweeps it clean.
    Tang the sharp mandoline!




FALSETTO SONG


    WHEN I was young, in ages past,
    My soul had cast
    Man's foolish shape,
    And like a black and hairy ape -- 
    My shadow, he
    Now mimics me.
    Follows slinking in my shade
    Through the corridors of life
    (Stifling 'twixt the walls I made
    With the mud and murderous knife),
    Takes the pulse of my black heart,
    Never once controls my will,
    Apes me selling in the mart
    Song-birds hate did kill.




EVENTAIL


    LOVELY Semiramis
    Closes her slanting eyes:
    Dead is she long ago.
    From her fan, sliding slow,
    Parrot-bright fire's feathers,
    Gilded as June weathers,
    Plumes bright and shrill as grass
    Twinkle down; as they pass
    Through the green glooms in Hell
    Fruits with a tuneful smell,
    Grapes like an emerald rain,
    Where the full moon has lain,
    Greengages bright as grass,
    Melons as cold as glass,
    Piled on each gilded booth,
    Feel their cheeks growing smooth.
    Apes in plumed head-dresses
    Whence the bright heat hisses, -- 
    Nubian faces, sly
    Pursing mouth, slanting eye,
    Feel the Arabian
    Winds floating from the fan:
    Salesmen with gilded face
    Paler grow, nod apace;
    Oh, the fan's blowing
    Cold winds ... It is snowing!




FIFTEEN BUCOLIC POEMS


WHAT THE GOOSEGIRL SAID ABOUT THE DEAN

    Turn again, turn again,
    Goose Clothilda, Goosie Jane!

    The wooden waves of people creak
    From houses built with coloured straws
    Of heat; Dean Pappus' long nose snores -- 
    Harsh as a hautbois, marshy-weak.

    The wooden waves of people creak
    Through the fields all water-sleek;

    And in among the straws of light
    Those bumpkin hautbois-sounds take flight,

    Whence he lies snoring like the moon,
    Clownish-white all afternoon,

    Beneath the trees' arsenical
    Harsh wood-wind tunes. Heretical -- 

    (Blown like the wind's mane
    Creaking woodenly again)

    His wandering thoughts escape like geese,
    Till he, their gooseherd, sets up chase,
    And clouds of wool join the bright race
    For scattered old simplicities.



NOAH


    Noah, through green waters slipping sliding like a long sleek eel,
    Slithered up Mount Ararat and climbed into the Ark, -- 
    Slipping with his long dank hair; and sliding slyly in his barque,
    Pushed it slowly in a wholly glassy creek until we feel
    Pink crags tremble under us and wondrous clear waters run
    Over Shem and Ham and Japhet, moving with their long sleek daughters,
    Swift as fishes rainbow-coloured darting under morning waters....
    Burning seraph beasts sing clearly to the young flamingo Sun.

THE GIRL WITH THE LINT-WHITE LOCKS


    THE bright-striped wooden fields are edged
    With noisy cock's crow trees, scarce fledged -- 

    The trees that spin like tops, all weathers,
    Like strange birds ruffling glassy feathers.

    My hair is white as flocks of geese,
    And water hisses out of this;

    And when the late sun burns my cheek
    Till it is pink as apples sleek,

    I wander in the fields and know
    Why kings do squander pennies so -- 

    Lest they at last should weight their eyes!
    But beggars' ragged minds, more wise,

    Know without flesh we cannot see -- 
    And so they hoard stupidity

    (The dull ancestral memory
    That is the only property).

    They laugh to see the spring fields edged
    With noisy cock's crow trees scarce fledged,

    And flowers that grunt to feel their eyes
    Made clear with sight's finalities.




THE LADY WITH THE SEWING MACHINE


    ACROSS the fields as green as spinach,
    Cropped as close as Time to Greenwich,

    Stands a high house; if at all,
    Spring comes like a Paisley shawl -- 

    Patternings meticulous
    And youthfully ridiculous.

    In each room the yellow sun
    Shakes like a canary, run

    On run, roulade, and watery trill -- 
    Yellow, meaningless, and shrill.

    Face as white as any clock's,
    Cased in parsley-dark curled locks,

    All day long you sit and sew,
    Stitch life down for fear it grow,

    Stitch life down for fear we guess
    At the hidden ugliness.

    Dusty voice that throbs with heat,
    Hoping with its steel-thin beat

    To put stitches in my mind,
    Make it tidy, make it kind;

    You shall not! I'll keep it free
    Though you turn earth sky and sea

    To a patchwork quilt to keep
    Your mind snug and warm in sleep.




BY CANDLELIGHT


    Houses red as flower of bean,
    Flickering leaves and shadows lean!
    Pantalone, like a parrot,
    Sat and grumbled in the garret,
    Sat and growled and grumbled till
    Moon upon the window-sill,
    Like a red geranium,
    Scented his bald cranium.
    Said Brighella, meaning well -- 
    Pack your box and -- go to Hell!
    Heat will cure your rheumatism.
    Silence crowned this optimism.
    Not a sound and not a wail -- 
    But the fire (lush leafy vale)
    Watched the angry feathers fly.
    Pantalone 'gan to cry -- 
    Could not, _would_ not, pack his box.
    Shadows (curtseying hens and cocks)
    Pecking in the attic gloom,
    Tried to smother his tail-plume....
    Till a cock's comb candle-flame,
    Crowing loudly, died: Dawn came.


SERENADE


    The tremulous gold of stars within your hair
      Are yellow bees flown from the hive of night,
    Finding the blossom of your eyes more fair
    Than all the pale flowers folded from the light.
    Then, Sweet, awake, and ope your dreaming eyes
    Ere those bright bees have flown and darkness dies.



CLOWNS' HOUSES


    Beneath the flat and paper sky
    The sun, a demon's eye,
    Glowed through the air, that mask of glass;
    All wand'ring sounds that pass

    Seemed out of tune, as if the light
    Were fiddle-strings pulled tight.
    The market square with spire and bell
    Clanged out the hour in Hell.

    The busy chatter of the heat
    Shrilled like a parokeet;
    And shuddering at the noonday light
    The dust lay dead and white

    As powder on a mummy's face,
    Or fawned with simian grace
    Round booths with many a hard bright toy
    And wooden brittle joy:

    The cap and bells of Time the Clown
    That, jangling, whistled down
    Young cherubs hidden in the guise
    Of every bird that flies;

    And star-bright masks for youth to wear,
    Lest any dream that fare
   -- Bright pilgrim -- past our ken, should see
    Hints of Reality.

    Upon the sharp-set grass, shrill-green,
    Tall trees like rattles lean,
    And jangle sharp and dizzily;
    But when night falls they sigh

    Till Pierrot moon steals slyly in,
    His face more white than sin,
    Black-masked, and with cool touch lays bare
    Each cherry, plum, and pear.

    Then underneath the veil d eyes
    Of houses, darkness lies, -- 
    Tall houses; like a hopeless prayer
    They cleave the sly dumb air.

    Blind are those houses, paper-thin;
    Old shadows hid therein,
    With sly and crazy movements creep
    Like marionettes, and weep.

    Tall windows show Infinity;
    And, hard reality,
    The candles weep and pry and dance
    Like lives mocked at by Chance.

    The rooms are vast as Sleep within:
    When once I ventured in,
    Chill Silence, like a surging sea,
    Slowly enveloped me.



THE SATYR IN THE PERIWIG


    The Satyr Scarabombadon
    Pulled periwig and breeches on:
    Grown old and stiff, this modern dress
    Adds monstrously to my distress;
    The gout within a hoofen heel
    Is _very_ hard to bear; I feel
    When crushed into a buckled shoe
    The twinge will be redoubled, too.
    And when I walk in gardens green
    And, weeping, think on what has been,
    Then wipe one eye, -- the other sees
    The plums and cherries on the trees.
    Small bird-quick women pass me by
    With sleeves that flutter airily,
    And baskets blazing like a fire
    With laughing fruits of my desire;
    Plums sunburnt as the King of Spain,
    Gold-cheeked as any Nubian,
    With strawberries all goldy-freckled,
    Pears fat as thrushes and as speckled ...
    Pursue them?... Yes, and squeeze a tear:
    `Please spare poor Satyr one, my dear.`
    `Be off, sir; go and steal your own!`
   -- Alas, poor Scarabombadon,
    They'd rend his ruffles, stretch a twig,
    Tear off a satyr's periwig!




THE MUSLIN GOWN


    With spectacles that flash,
    Striped foolscap hung with gold
    And silver bells that clash,
    (Bright rhetoric and cold),
    In owl-dark garments goes the Rain,
    Dull pedagogue, again.
    And in my orchard wood
    Small song-birds flock and fly,
    Like cherubs brown and good,
    When through the trees go I
    Knee-deep within the dark-leaved sorrel.
    Cherries red as bells of coral
    Ring to see me come -- 
    I, with my fruit-dark hair
    As dark as any plum,
    My summer gown as white as air
    And frilled as any quick bird's there.
    But oh, what shall I do?
    Old Owl-wing's back from town -- 
    He's skipping through dark trees: I know
    He _hates_ my summer gown!



MISS NETTYBUN AND THE SATYR'S CHILD


    As underneath the trees I pass
    Through emerald shade on hot soft grass,
    Petunia faces, glowing-hued
    With heat, cast shadows hard and crude -- 
    Green-velvety as leaves, and small
    Fine hairs like grass pierce through them all.
    But these are all asleep -- asleep,
    As through the schoolroom door I creep
    In search of you, for you evade
    All the advances I have made.
    Come, Horace, you must take my hand.
    This sulking state I will not stand!
    But you shall feed on strawberry jam
    At tea-time, if you cease to slam
    The doors that open from our sense -- 
    Through which I slipped to drag you hence!




QUEEN VENUS AND THE CHOIR-BOY

    The apples grow like silver trumps
    That red-cheeked fair-haired angels blow -- 
    So clear their juice; on trees in clumps,
    Feathered as any bird, they grow.

    A lady stood amid those crops -- 
    Her voice was like a blue or pink
    Glass window full of lollipops;
    Her words were very strange, I think:

    Prince Paris, too, a fair-haired boy
    Plucked me an apple from dark trees;
    Since when their smoothness makes my joy;
    If you will pluck me one of these

    I'll kiss you like a golden wind
    As clear as any apples be.
    And now she haunts my singing mind -- 
    And oh, she will not set me free.





THE APE SEES THE FAT WOMAN


    Among the dark and brilliant leaves,
    Where flowers seem tinsel firework-sheaves,

    Blond barley-sugar children stare
    Through shining apple-trees, and there

    A lady like a golden wind
    Whose hair like apples tumbles kind,

    And whose bright name, so I believe,
    Is sometimes Venus, sometimes Eve,

    Stands, her face furrowed like my own
    With thoughts wherefrom strange seeds are sown,

    Whence, long since, stars for bright flowers grew
    Like periwinkles pink and blue, -- 

    (Queer impulses of bestial kind,
    Flesh indivisible from mind.)

    I, painted like the wooden sun,
    Must hand-in-hand with angels run -- 

    The tinsel angels of the booth
    That lead poor yokels to the truth

    Through raucous jokes, till we can see
    That narrow long Eternity

    Is but the whip's lash o'er our eyes -- 
    Spurring to new vitalities.




THE APE WATCHES AUNT SALLY


    The apples are an angel's meat,
    The shining dark leaves make clear-sweet

    The juice; green wooden fruits alway
    Drop on these flowers as white as day -- 

    Clear angel-face on hairy stalk;
    (Soul grown from flesh, an ape's young talk.)

    And in this green and lovely ground
    The Fair, world-like, turns round and round,

    And bumpkins throw their pence to shed
    Aunt Sally's crude-striped wooden head.

    I do not care if men should throw
    Round sun and moon to make me go,

    (As bright as gold and silver pence) ...
    They cannot drive their own blood hence!




SPRINGING JACK


    Green wooden leaves clap light away,
    Severely practical, as they

    Shelter the children, candy-pale.
    The chestnut-candles flicker, fail....

    The showman's face is cubed clear as
    The shapes reflected in a glass

    Of water -- (glog, glut, a ghost's speech
    Fumbling for space from each to each).

    The fusty showman fumbles, must
    Fit in a particle of dust

    The universe, for fear it gain
    Its freedom from my box of brain.

    Yet dust bears seeds that grow to grace
    Behind my crude-striped wooden face

    As I, a puppet tinsel-pink,
    Leap on my springs, learn how to think,

    Then like the trembling golden stalk
    Of some long-petalled star, I walk

    Through the dark heavens until dew
    Falls on my eyes and sense thrills through.



    Turn, turn again,
    Ape's blood in each vein.
    The people that pass
    Seem castles of glass,
    The old and the good,
    Giraffes of blue wood;
    The soldier, the nurse,
    Wooden face and a curse,
    Are shadowed with plumage
    Like birds by the gloomage.
    Blond hair like a clown's,
    The music floats, drowns
    The creaking of ropes
    The breaking of hopes.
    The wheezing, the old,
    Like harmoniums scold:
    Go to Babylon, Rome,
    The brain-cells called home,
    The grave, New Jerusalem,
    Wrinkled Methusalem:
    From our floating hair
    Derived the first fair
    And queer inspiration
    Of music (the nation
    Of bright-plumed trees
    And harpy-shrill breeze).

    *       *       *       *       *

    Turn, turn again,
    Ape's blood in each vein.




_SEVEN NURSERY SONGS_



OLD LADY FLY-AWAY


    Old Lady Fly-Away
    Lost her temper, night and day,
    Took the bright moon's broom -- 
    Swept round the attic room.
    Dear me, where _can_ it be?
    Not a temper can I see!
    Sighed the Moon upon the stair:
    Always look to see, dear,
    When you `put your foot down,`
    Lest it crushes Babylon;
    _Try_ to get it nearer home,
    In fields of clover or in Rome!
    Old Lady Fly-Away
    Knew her temper would not stay,
    So pretended not to hear -- 
    Sweeping for it on the stair.




GREAT SNORING AND NORWICH

    Great Snoring and Norwich
    A dish of pease porridge!
    The clock of Troy town
    Strikes one o'clock; brown
    Honey-bees in the clover
    Are half-the-seas-over,
    And Time is a-boring
    From here to Great Snoring.
    But Time, the grey mouse,
    Can't wake up the house,
    For old King Priam
    Is sleepy as I am!






FAT WILLIAM AND THE TRAINS

    When I should be at work, instead
    I lie and kick for fun, in bed:
    Down the narrow rails, hear trains
    Go quick as other people's brains -- 
    Hump their backs and snore and growl,
    Grumble, rumble, tumble, prowl -- 
    Bearing people, pink as pigs,
    Through water-clear fields dancing jigs.
    Like a whale among my pillows
    Dash I, splash I, sheets in billows
    As the trains toss spangled seas,
    Like bright flags on the tusks of these.
    How I envy those at work
    When I can lie in bed and shirk.




A PENNY FARE TO BABYLON

    A penny fare to Babylon,
    A penny for each thought!
    Oh, ma'am, no, ma'am,
    Can't be bought!
    The Sun gives pots of money,
    The Moon, her bread and honey,
    When humming like a clover-field
    I go up to town.
    Whitened by the Moon's flour,
    All the birds I own,
    Lest they be baked into a pie,
    Are flown, dear, flown.
    Though you whistle in the corridors
    That dance into my brain -- 
    Oh, ma'am, no, ma'am,
    They will not come again.



THE BUTCHER'S SHOP

    Pantaloon jumps in his bright
    Butcher's shop, where red and white
    Meat hangs up like clown's attire -- 
    Laughs as shrill as grass or fire.
    In his house sits Il Dottore,
    In the rickety top story
    Plays a mandoline to please
    Coral bells on cherry trees....
    But the bees have left his bonnet
    For the meat; they buzz upon it -- 
    Goldy summer lights -- they hover
    Like the bees upon red clover,
    Flying straight into the shop,
    Full of facts, where theories stop.




THE KING OF CHINA'S DAUGHTER

The King of China's daughter, She never would love me Though I hung my
cap and bells upon Her nutmeg tree. For oranges and lemons, The stars in
bright blue air, (I stole them long ago, my dear) Were dangling there.
The Moon did give me silver pence, The Sun did give me gold, And both
together softly blew And made my porridge cold; But the King of China's
daughter Pretended not to see When I hung my cap and bells upon Her
nutmeg tree.




OLD KING PTOLEMY


    Old King Ptolemy
    Climbed the stair
    Into the attic
    Of Anywhere.
    Old King Ptolemy
    Sulked to bed;
    Maids cleared up his toys -- 
    Broken, they said.
    The King's in a temper,
    The King's in a pet,
    Wriggling their necks like geese -- 
    Oh, what a fret!
    The Struwwelpeter
    Round-eyed Sun,
    Rocked on his rocking-horse
    Half in fun, -- 
    Rocked on the landing,
    Rocked on the stair:
    Babylon's empty,
    The cupboard is bare....
    King Ptolemy's snoring
    Sounds on the breeze
    Like the sound of fruit growing
    On mulberry trees.




PEDAGOGUES AND FLOWER-SHOWS



    Tall cranes with wooden bodices
    Stuffed full of shadow odyssies.

    They hiss like geese through schoolroom
    bars
    At the bright flower-show of the stars.

    The houses (children's bricks) float by
    On swords of moonshine, cry and sigh.

    The schoolmen spray with glittering laughter
    This flower-show, budding strangely after.

    Our map-like cheeks are painted red
    Where sawdust gods were pierced and bled

    By all this moonshine, and we feel
    Blood should be dry, -- Erazureel

    Cried; Blue, pink, yellow planets, bright
    Flowers frilled as seas breathe in the night;

    These frill d pinks, so neat and nice,
    We'll teach to turn the world to ice.

    Our science then can soon inure
    The stars to blossom from manure;

    The world will be all map-like, plain
    As our lined cheeks, and once again

    The soul (moot point) will scarce intrude
    Its lack of depth and magnitude!




PEDAGOGUES AND FLOWER-SHOWS



WHAT THE PROFESSOR SAID TO THE EDITOR OF WHEELS

    Old Professor Goosecap
    Watched the planet's flower-show.
    Pedagogues well-drilled, mayhap,
    Marshalled in a row,
    Can perceive in China asters
    Half a hemisphere's disasters,
    With rays to pierce the fourth dimension:
    Come, limit it to our declension!
    Pedagogues, through schoolroom bars,
    Must thrust their faces like a map
    Crown d with a dunce's cap,
    To hiss like geese at the stars,
    And crush with wooden toe -- 
    All growing,
    And blowing,
    These Canterbury bells as they blow,
    These silvery bells in a row!




SWITCHBACK


    By the blue wooden sea,
    Curling laboriously,
    Coral and amber grots
    (Cherries and apricots),
    Ribbons of noisy heat,
    Binding them head and feet,
    Horses as fat as plums
    Snort as each bumpkin comes.
    Giggles like towers of glass
    (Pink and blue spirals) pass,
    Oh, how the Vacancy
    Laughed at them rushing by!
    Turn again, flesh and brain,
    Only yourselves again!
    How far above the Ape,
    Differing in each shape,
    You with your regular,
    Meaningless circles are!




TRAMS


    Castles of crystal,
    Castles of wood,
    Moving on pulleys
    Just as you should!
    See the gay people
    Flaunting like flags,
    Bells in the steeple,
    Sky all in rags.
    Bright as a parrot
    Flaunts the gay heat -- 
    Songs in the garret,
    Fruit in the street;
    Plump as a cherry,
    Red as a rose,
    Old Mother Berry -- 
    Blowing her nose!




BANK HOLIDAY



    The houses on a see-saw rush
    In the giddy sun's hard spectrum, push

    The noisy heat's machinery;
    Like flags of coloured heat they fly.

    The wooden ripples of the smiles
    Suck down the houses, then at whiles,

    Grown suctioned like an octopus,
    They throw them up again at us,

    As we rush by on coloured bars
    Of sense, vibrating flower-hued stars,

    With lips like velvet drinks and winds
    That bring strange Peris to our minds.




BANK HOLIDAY



    Seas are roaring like a lion; with their
    wavy flocks Zion,
    Noses like a scimitar,
    Hair a brassy bar
    Come
    To
    The sun's drum; through
    Light green waters swim their daughters, lashing
    with their eel-sleek-locks
    The furred
    Heads
    Of mermaids that occurred,
    Sinking to their cheap beds.
    Blurred
    Legs, like trunks of tropical
    Plants, rise up and, over all,
    Green as a conservatory,
    Is the light ... another story....
    It has grown too late for life:
    Put on your gloves and take a drive!




SMALL TALK


    Upon the noon Cassandra died
    The harpy preened itself outside.

    Bank Holiday put forth its glamour,
    And in the wayside station's clamour

    We found the caf  at the rear,
    And sat and drank our Pilsener beer.

    Words smeared upon our wooden faces
    Now paint them into queer grimaces;

    The crackling greeneries that spirt
    Like fireworks, mock our souls inert,

    And we seem feathered like a bird
    Among those shadows scarcely heard.

    Beneath her shade-ribbed switchback mane
    The harpy, breasted like a train,

    Was haggling with a farmer's wife:
    Fresh harpy's eggs, no trace of life.

    Miss Sitwell, cross and white as chalk,
    Was indisposed for the small talk.

    Since, peering through a shadowed door,
    She saw Cassandra on the floor.




SMALL TALK


    Upon the noon
    Cassandra died,
    Harpy soon
    Screeched outside.
    Gardener Jupp,
    In his shed,
    Counted wooden
    Carrots red.
    Black shades pass,
    Dead-stiff there,
    On green baize grass -- 
    Drink his beer.
    Bumpkin turnip,
    Mask limp-locked,
    White sun frights
    The gardener shocked.
    Harpy creaked
    Her limbs again:
    I think, she squeaked,
    It's going to rain!






    Dance the jig, whirl
    In the street, girl.
    Rush up and down,
    Houses, to town -- 
    On the see-saw
    Made out of raw
    Hot yellow rays,
    Crude edges of days.
    Dance the jig, whirl -- 
    Like your blond curl!
    Oh! it is fine to-day,
    On this Bank Holiday!
    Sound of young feet
    Comes down the street ...
    Never again
    Pleasure or pain....
    Dance the jig, whirl
    In the street, girl.
    Do the dead ache
    In summer, to slake
    Their thirst of love? -- Hush, -- 
    No tears to gush,
    My soul is of mud,
    Cannot weep blood....

    *       *       *       *       *

    Dance the jig, dance the jig, -- 
    Dance the jig, girl.




MESSALINA AT MARGATE


    The tents are coloured like a child's balloons;
    They swell upon the air like August moons
    Anchored by waters paler than a pearl;
    The airs like rain-wet shrinking petals curl

    Beneath the rainbow lights of noon that fill
    The open calyx with the faintest thrill,
    Then break in airy bubbles on the sense
    Like sounds upheld in exquisite suspense.

    In grande toilette, and with a parasol
    Bright-fring d as the noonday sun, (that fool
    Of beauty,) Messalina promenades.
    A crinoline keeps off the other shades:

    Her grape-black hair casts shadows deep as death;
    All curled and high, yet stirring at Time's breath.
    The powder on her face is shuddering white
    As dust of aeons seen in heaven's light.

    She leaves the sands, where in tents striped like fruits
    The dancers whirl like winds to airy flutes,
    And music, soother than the pulp of pearls
    Whose sweetness decks the swan-white syren girls,

    In air-pale waves like water, has the sheen
    Of mirrors, floats like flower-wing'd stars. -- O spleen!
    Leave Regent's Park and quit society
    Only to find this immorality!

    So now she goes to church, where bonnets steam
    Like incense, and the painted windows seem
    Naught but a coloured veil stupidity
    Had wrought to clothe her dumb soliloquy:

    There's comfort in old age: the steam of food
    Ascending like the rich man's soul to God;
    And little words that crackle as they went,
    How such and such a life was evil spent,

    Until they make a fire to warm our hands.
    For Time has wrapp'd the heart in swaddling bands,
    But yet they could not save it from the cold. -- 
    The soul's a pander grown; for she has sold

    My body to the Church; does nicely now.
    Oh! Soul has much to learn from flesh, I vow.
    Thus Messalina, grown both old and fat, -- 
    The Church's parrot now, and dull at that!




PEDAGOGUES


    The air is like a jarring bell
    That jangles words it cannot spell,
    And black as Fate, the iron trees
    Stretch thirstily to catch the breeze.

    The fat leaves pat the shrinking air;
    The hot sun's patronising stare
    Rouses the stout flies from content
    To some small show of sentiment.

    Beneath the terrace shines the green
    Metallic strip of sea, and sheen
    Of sands, where folk flaunt parrot-bright
    With rags and tags of noisy light.

    The brass band's snorting stabs the sky
    And tears the yielding vacancy -- 
    The imbecile and smiling blue
    Until fresh meaning trickles through;

    And slowly we perambulate
    With spectacles that concentrate,
    In one short hour, Eternity,
    In one small lens, Infinity.

    With children, our primeval curse,
    We overrun the universe -- 
    Beneath the giddy lights of noon,
    White as a tired August moon.

    The air is like a jarring bell
    That jangles words it cannot spell,
    And black as Fate, the iron trees
    Stretch thirstily to catch the breeze.




SONG FROM THE QUEEN OF PALMYRA


    And shall we never find those diamonds bright
    That were the fawn-queen of Palmyra's eyes? -- 
    Ah, dark hot jewels lie hidden from the sight
    Beneath dark palm-trees where the river sighs
    Beyond the tomb of young eternities;
    And in the desert, lonely flowers weep -- 
    The clouds have such long hair -- that tangles Sleep.




THE CHOIR-BOY RIDES ON THE SWITCHBACK


    In the fruit-ripe heat of afternoon
    Each muslined school-child seems a moon;

    And in the tents, those lazy waves
    From out the echoing coral caves

    Of light, like Venus from the sea
    The clown seems, blond hair floating free.

    The switchback, with its noisy run,
    Is turning like the wooden sun

    As he rides on his rocking-horse
    All Struwwelpeter-haired; we course

    On sands as moist as sugar-cane,
    And the Fat Woman's face and mane

    Are sometimes dappled by the shade
    Into the likeness of some maid

    Long dead ... those golden shadows fell
    On Cressid or Alaciel.

    The beggar-tunes on horseback ride,
    With cheeks as pink as Angels', -- glide

    Through Babylon, Chicago, Troy,
    And Black Man's Land. Each golden boy

    Blows silver trumpets over these,
    As clear as apples on the trees.

    I will go home and pack my pride,
    Then with these beggar-tunes I'll ride -- 

    For all the hymns I try to sing
    Are but Love's beggars shivering

    In thorny thickets where one sees
    Stars grow for wild wet raspberries.




APRICOT JAM


    Beneath the dancing, glancing green
    The tea is spread amid the sheen
    Of pince-nez (glints of thought); thus seen,
    In sharp reflections only, brain
    Perceives the world all flat and plain
    In rounded segments, joy and pain.
    The parasols dance like the sun,
    Cast wavering nets of shade that run
    Across the chattering table's fun,
    The laughing faces, and across
    Half-shadowed faces looking cross,
    And black hair with a bird-bright gloss.
    The flashing children stayed and checked,
    Smooth india-rubber leaves reflect
    Their parrot-green on circumspect
    Glazed china, where the negroid tea
    Reflects the world's obscurity
    In high lights such as pince-nez see.
    And all the sheen of shadows feather
    Muslin frocks like plumes; together,
    In the hot and flashing weather,
    Bird-high voices shrill and chatter
    With the high and glinting clatter
    Tea-cups make, and whispered patter -- 
    (Listen, and you'll get a slap!)
    Worlds are small as any map,
    And life will come our way -- mayhap.




STOPPING PLACE


    The world grows furry, grunts with sleep ...
    But I must on the surface keep.
    The jolting of the train to me
    Seems some primeval vertebrae
    Attached by life-nerves to my brain -- 
    Reactionary once again.
    So that I see shapes crude and new
    And ordered, -- with some end in view,
    No longer with the horny eyes
    Of other people's memories.
    Through highly varnished yellow heat,
    As through a lens that does not fit,
    The faces jolt in cubes, and I
    Perceive their odd solidity
    And lack of meaning absolute:
    For why should noses thus protrude,
    And to what purpose can relate
    Each hair so oddly separate?
    Anchored against the puff of breeze,
    As shallow as the crude blue seas,
    The coloured blocks and cubes of faces
    Seem Noah's arks that shelter races
    Of far absurdities to breed
    Their queer kind after we are dead.
    Blue wooden foliage creaks with heat
    And there are woollen buns to eat -- 
    Bright-varnished buns to touch and see
    And, black as an Inferno, tea.
    Then (Recketts' blue) a puff of wind....
    Heredity regains my mind
    And I am sitting in the train
    While thought becomes like flesh, -- the brain
    Not independent, but derived
    From hairy matter that half lived -- 
    Identities not round or whole.
    A questing beast who thirsts for soul,
    The furry vegetation there -- 
    Purring with heat, sucks in the air;
    And dust that's gathered in the train,
    Protecting flesh, seems almost brain -- 
    (That horny substance altering sight);
    How strange, intangible is light
    Whence all is born, and yet by touch
    We live, -- the rest is not worth much....
    Once more the world grows furred with sleep, -- 
    But I must on the surface keep
    While mammoths from the heat are born -- 
    Great clumsy trains with tusk and horn
    Whereon the world's too sudden tossed
    Through frondage of our mind, and lost.




PORTRAIT OF A BARMAID


    Metallic waves of people jar
    Through crackling green toward the bar

    Where on the tables, chattering-white,
    The sharp drinks quarrel with the light.

    Those coloured muslin blinds the smiles
    Shroud wooden faces in their wiles -- 

    Sometimes they splash like water (you
    Yourself reflected in their hue).

    The conversation, loud and bright,
    Seems spinal bars of shunting light

    In firework-spirting greenery,
    O complicate machinery

    For building Babel, iron crane
    Beneath your hair, that blue-ribbed mane

    In noise and murder like the sea
    Without its mutability

    Outside the bar, where jangling heat
    Seems out of tune and off the beat,

    A concertina's glycerine
    Exudes and mirrors in the green

    Your soul, pure glucose edged with hints
    Of tentative and half-soiled tints.




MATERIALISM; OR, PASTOR ---- TAKES THE RESTAURANT CAR FOR HEAVEN


    Upon sharp floods of noise there glide
    The red-brick houses, float, collide

    With aspidestras, trains on steel
    That lead us not to what we feel.

    Hot glassy lights fill up the gloom
    As water an aquarium, -- 

    All mirror-bright; beneath these seen,
    Our faces coloured by their sheen,

    Seem objects under water, bent
    By each bright-hued advertisement

    Whose words are stamped upon our skin
    As though the heat had burnt them in.

    The jolting of the train that made
    All objects coloured bars of shade,

    Projects them sideways till they split
    Splinters from eyeballs as they flit.

    Down endless tubes of throats we squeeze
    Our words, lymphatic paint to please

    Our sense of neatness, neutralize
    The overtint and oversize.

    I think it true that Heaven should be
    A narrow train for you and me,

    Where we perpetually must haunt
    The moving oblique restaurant

    And feed on foods of other minds
    Behind the hot and dusty blinds.




THA S IN HEAVEN


    When you lay dying fast, you said -- 
    And, weeping, were not comforted:
    Look through this paper world! I see

    The lights of Heaven burn like gold
    The other side; and Souls are sold
    For these, yet only flesh, sold we!

    And then you died and went to bliss. -- 
    I'm curious now to know if love
    Is really Heaven -- where _you_ rove. -- 
    Your kind of love ... or mine, Tha s?

    And is there still the clinging mud?
    I think it drowned your soul like wine.
    And do the stars like street-lamps shine,
    Gilding the gutters where you stood,

    And lighting up your small face where
    Thin powder, like a trail of dust,
    Shows the mortality of lust ...
    Still black as hissing rain, your hair?

    Your body had become your soul....
    Tha s, -- do spirits crumble whole?




_FOUR NOCTURNES_



PROCESSIONS


    Within the long black avenues of Night
    Go pageants of delight,

    With masks of glass the night has stained with wine,
    Hair lifted like a vine; -- 

    And all the coloured curtains of the air
    Were fluttered. Passing there,

    The sounds seemed warring suns; and music flowed
    As blood; the mask'd lamps showed

    Tall houses light had gilded like despair:
    Black windows, gaping there.

    Through all the rainbow spaces of our laughter
    Those pageants followed after;

    The negress Night, within her house of glass
    Watched the processions pass.




GAIETY


    Blow out the candles. Let the dance begin.
    Already, pale as Sin,

    The candles weep and pry like living things ...
    They dance, who have no wings.

    More vast and black than endless sleep, this room.
    Time beats his empty drum

    Whose hollow sound is echoed in our eyes -- 
    Deep wells where no moon lies.

    A crumpled paper mask hides every face -- 
    Creased to a smile of grace,

    With eyelids gilded, so the bitter tears
    Make music for men's ears.

    These masks, some coloured like an August moon,
    Or white, as sands that swoon

    Within Time's hour-glass, some as grey as rain, -- 
    Still mimic joy and pain.

    Thin pointed rags and tags edge our attire ...
    Bright plumes?... or tongues of fire,

    Whose painted laughter cracks the gilded sky
    Of this flat empery

    That has no soil where any flower may root,
    Nor rest for weary foot,

    But endless leagues of mirror: such the ground
    That no horizons bound, -- 

    Carved topaz water; -- sound a mirror seems!
    O! nakedness of dreams

    Beneath the blinding radiance of hot skies
    Where no sun lives or dies.

    *       *       *       *       *

    Now that the dusty, creaking curtain, Day,
    Is folded, laid away,

    Each masked dancer is both pierc d Heart
    And Dream, its poiniard.

    Small winds creep from Infinity.... A flame
    Our blown hair, white as shame.

    Those seeds of worlds, the stars, are nought but blown
    Red tinsel from a Clown;

    The candles, living things to dance and pry:
    Out! hard Reality!



VACUUM


    Blown through the leaden circles of our hell,
    Each wisp of soul, tattered by winds of lust,
    Clawed at the voices, like a beaten bell.
    No movement ever raised the lifeless dust,

    As, blown beneath the night's enormous pall,
    We call to you with goatish prance and paces:
    Our lips are red as nights of festival
    And hell has dyed its fires upon our faces.

    These barren bodies may no children breed
    To quench the sun with their corrupted breath
    Save these our hearts, our breasts, our bodies feed -- 
    The fruit of love like ours, the worms of death.

    Within our brain the darkness slowly fell:
    Our eyes' dark vacuum reflects no days -- 
    No voice, no sight, no thought within our hell -- 
    But only flesh our loneliness allays.







    Monotonously fell the rain,
    Like thoughts within an empty brain;

    The lolling weeds that fattened there
    Absorbed the broken lifeless air.

    Do those dim eyes still hold a flame
    That leaps to Heaven at my name?

    Mine eyes would hold God's face in sight;
    But your lips burned away the light.

    Within your brain the blood runs high?
    You came like thought; you licked it dry.

    Oh, we have burnt our souls with lust
    Till they are whiter than the dust ...

    Now are they white as purity?
    You blind mine eyes ... I cannot see.

    I am so tired -- I fain would creep
    To hide within your heart and weep.

    My heart is dust ... no tears to shed.
    But carrion lives -- it lives -- I said.




_TREATS_



FUNERALS


    Beneath umbrellas I can see
    Pink faces sheened with stupidity,

    With whiskers spirting from them, (days
    Of boredom, black and sentient rays

    From other personalities.)
    And, mourners too, white-bearded seas

    Walk slowly by them as they come,
    Sing hymns to the wind's harmonium.

    Old men shake hands; their clawing grasp
    Seems like a door without a clasp -- 

    That gapes on slow black emptiness....
    Now, -- vanished is her cracked black dress,
    The house grows tall from vacancy,
    And in the kitchen I take tea

    While the furry sun creeps out -- that raw
    Life, -- sheathes its murderous claw

    And lets its tongue slink out to lap
    The silence -- (a slow-leaking tap)....


THE COUNTY CALLS


    They came upon us like a train -- 
    A rush, a scream, then gone again!
    With bodies like a continent
    Encased in silken seas, they went

    And came and called and took their tea
    And patronised the Deity
    Who copies their munificence
    With creditable heart and sense.

    Each face a plaster monument
    For some belov d aliment,
    Whose everlasting sleep they deign
    To cradle in the Great Inane;

    Each tongue, a noisy clockwork bell
    To toll the passing hour that fell;
    Each hat, an architect's device
    For building churches, cheap and nice.

    _I saw_ the County Families
    Advance and sit and take their teas;
    I saw the County gaze askance
    At my thin insignificance:

    Small thoughts like frightened fishes glide
    Beneath their eyes' pale glassy tide:
    They said: Poor thing! we must be nice!
    They said: We know your father! -- twice.



SOLO FOR EAR-TRUMPET


    The carriage brushes through the bright
    Leaves (violent jets from life to light).
    Strong polished speed is plunging, heaves
    Between the showers of bright hot leaves.
    The window-glasses glaze our faces
    And jarr them to the very basis, -- 
    But they could never put a polish
    Upon my manners, or abolish
    My most distinct disinclination
    For calling on a rich relation!
    In her house, bulwark built between
    The life man lives and visions seen, -- 
    The sunlight hiccups white as chalk,
    Grown drunk with emptiness of talk,
    And silence hisses like a snake,
    Invertebrate and rattling ache.

    *       *       *       *       *

    Till suddenly, Eternity
    Drowns all the houses like a sea,
    And down the street the Trump of Doom
    Blares, -- barely shakes this drawing-room
    Where raw-edged shadows sting forlorn
    As dank dark nettles. Down the horn
    Of her ear-trumpet I convey
    The news that: It is Judgment Day!
    Speak louder; I don't catch, my dear.
    I roared: _It is the Trump we hear!_
    The _What_? -- The TRUMP! ... I shall complain -- 
    The boy-scouts practising again!




ANTIC HAY


    How like a lusty satyr, the hot sun
    Doth in his orbit run
    O'er rivers and the light blue hills of noon,
    And where the white still moon
    Sleeps in the lovely woodlands of the light.
    Made drunken with his might,
    Like flames the goat-foot satyrs leap and fling
    The blossom'd beans of Spring.
    The oreads leave their swan-like fountains, bells
    Of foam, and dark wood-wells,
    And grasses where the pale dew lovelorn lies
    And like an echo dies.
    The river-gods are tossing their blue manes
    Still wet with brine; the reins
    Lie loosely on their plunging horses; earth
    Shakes with the storm of mirth;
    And all the cloudy castles of the air
    Are bathed with radiance. There,
    Beneath dark chestnut trees, King Pan doth sport
    With all his horn d court.
    Their goat-feet clattering to the oaten tune
    That cools the heat of noon
    Like water gurgling; hoofs all wreath'd with flowers,
    Wild as the dew-pale hours,
    The clownish satyrs dance the antic hay;
    They butt with horns and sway,
    While laughing leaves, like smitten cymbals thrill
    Their sunburnt dance; until
    The light falls like a rain of panick'd leaves
    Through the gold heart of eves.
    O'er misty fields, mild Dian's old faint horn
    Bloweth a sound forlorn.
    Then from their hives with palest flowers bedight,
    The yellow bees take flight -- 
    Whirling where old Silenus tries to sing
    Unto his horn d King
   -- Feeding upon gold-freckled strawberries -- 
    And sting the poor fat fool until he cries.




LULLABY


    Golden night-airs lull his eyes,
    Starlight come not where Love lies,
    Lest your faint light touch his wings
    Who swiftly comes and swiftly flies;
    Lovers, wake him not with sighs,
    But list where Philomela sings
    Lullaby.

    Dreams come tiptoe to his bed,
    Dim fantastic wings outspread
    To fan his pretty sleeping eyes.
    Upon my breast he laid his head
    (On lilies white heap roses red);
    Hushed in my maiden heart, Love lies
    A-sleeping.




WATER MUSIC


    From Florence and from Venice,
    Like silver swans at noon,
    That silken dim winds menace -- 
    Each barque a drown d moon,
    I'll bring you freights of amber,
    Perfum d like the rose,
    To build your sleeping chamber,
    And song-birds for your close;
    Faint stars to go a-singing,
    Like fluttering nightingales
    From golden cages winging,
    When, Love, your tir'd wing fails.
    And as we come a-rowing,
    Great rainbows rise and swing
    Like haughty peacocks bowing
    In the gardens of the King.




THE WEB OF EROS


    Within your magic web of hair lies furled
    The fire and splendour of the ancient world;
    The dire gold of the comet's wind-blown hair,
    The songs that turned to gold the evening air
    When all the stars of heaven sang for joy;
    The flames that burnt the cloud-high city Troy;
    The maenad fire of spring on the cold earth,
    The myrrh-lit flames that gave both life and birth
    To the soul-Phoenix, and the star-bright shower
    That came to Danae in her brazen tower.
    Within your burning web of hair lies furled
    The fire and splendour of the ancient world.




DROWNED SUNS


    The swans more white than those forgotten fair
    Who ruled the kingdoms that of old-time were,
    Within the sunset water deeply gaze
    As though they sought some beautiful dim face,
    The youth of all the world; or pale lost gems,
    And crystal shimmering diadems,
    The moon for ever seeks in woodland streams
    To deck her cool faint beauty; thus in dreams,
    Belov'd, I seek lost suns within your eyes
    And find but wrecks of love's gold argosies.




THE SPIDER


    The fat light clings upon my skin,
    Like grease that slowly forms a thin
    And foul white film; so close it lies,
    It feeds upon my lips and eyes.

    The black fly hits the window-pane
    That shuts its dirty body in;
    So once, his spirit fought to quit
    The body that imprisoned it.

    He always seemed so fond of me,
    Until one day he chanced to see
    My head, a little on one side,
    Loll softly as if I had died.

    Since then, he rarely looked my way,
    Though he could never know what lay
    Within my brain; though iron his will,
    I thought, he's young and teachable.

    And often, as I took my drink,
    I chuckled in my heart to think
    Whose dark blood ran within his veins:
    You see, it spared me half my pains.

    The time was very long until
    I had the chance to work my will;
    Once seen, the way was clear as light,
    A father's patience infinite.

    He always was so sensitive;
    But soon I taught him how to live
    With each day, just a patch of white,
    A blinded patch of black, each night.

    Each day he watched my gaiety.
    It's very difficult to die
    When one is young.... I pitied him,
    The glass I filled up to the brim,

    His shaking fingers scarce could hold;
    His limbs were trembling as with cold....
    I waited till from night and day
    All meaning I had wiped away,

    And then I gave it him again;
    The wine made heaven in his brain.
    Then spider-like, the kindly wine
    Thrust tentacles through every vein,

    And knotted him so very fast
    I knew I had him safe at last.
    And sometimes in the dawn, I'd creep
    To watch him as he lay asleep,

    And each time, see my son's face grown
    In some blurred line, more like my own.
    A crumpled rag, he lies all night
    Until the first white smear of light;

    And sleep is but an empty hole ...
    No place for him to hide his soul,
    No outlet there to set him free:
    He never can escape from me.

    Yet still I never know what thought,
    All fly-like, in his mind lies caught:
    His face seems some half-spoken word
    Forgot again as soon as heard,

    Beneath the livid skin of light;
    Oh, just an empty space of white,
    Now all the meaning's gone. I'll sit
    A little while, and stare at it.




THE DRUNKARD


    This black tower drinks the blinding light.
    Strange windows livid white,

    Tremble beneath the curse of God.
    Yet living weeds still nod

    To the huge sun, a devil's eye
    That tracks the souls that die.

    The clock beats like the heart of Doom
    Within the narrow room;

    And whispering with some ghastly air
    The curtains float and stir.

    But still she never speaks a word;
    I think she hardly heard

    When I with reeling footsteps came
    And softly spoke her name.

    But yet she does not sleep. Her eyes
    Still watch in wide surprise

    The thirsty knife that pitied her;
    But those lids never stir,

    Though creeping Fear still gnaws like pain
    The hollow of her brain.

    She must have some sly plan, the cheat,
    To lie so still. The beat

    That once throbbed like a muffled drum
    With fear to hear me come,

    Now never sounds when I creep nigh.
    Oh! she was always sly.

    And if to spite her, I dared steal
    Behind her bed, and feel

    With fumbling fingers for her heart ...
    Ere I could touch the smart,

    Once more wild shriek on shriek would tear
    The dumb and shuddering air....

    And still she never speaks to me.
    She only smiles to see

    How in dark corners secret-sly
    New-born Eternity,

    All spider-like, doth spin and cast
    Strange threads to hold Time fast.




THE MOTHER


    Our dreams create the babes we bear;
    Our beauty goes to make them fair.
    We give them all we have of good,
    Our blood to drink, our hearts for food;

    And in our souls they lie and rest
    Until upon their mother's breast,
    So innocent and sweet they lie.
    They live to curse us; then they die.

    When he was born, it seemed the spring
    Had come again with birds to sing
    And blossoms dancing in the sun
    Where streams released from winter run.

    His sunlit hair was all my gold,
    His loving eyes my wealth untold;
    All heaven was hid within my breast
    Whereon my child was laid to rest.

    He grew to manhood. Then one came
    False-hearted as Hell's blackest shame,
    To steal my child from me, and thrust
    The soul I loved down to the dust.

    Her hungry, wicked lips were red
    As that dark blood my son's hand shed.
    Her eyes were black as Hell's own night,
    Her ice-cold breast was winter-white.

    I had put by a little gold
    To bury me when I was cold.
    Her fang d, wanton kiss to buy
    My son's love willed that I should die.

    The gold was hid beneath my bed;
    So little, and my weary head
    Was all the guard it had. They lie
    So quiet and still who soon must die.

    He stole to kill me while I slept -- 
    The little son, who never wept
    But that I kissed his tears away
    So fast, his weeping seemed but play.

    So light his footfall, yet I heard
    Its echo in my heart, and stirred
    From out my weary sleep to see
    My child's face bending over me.

    The wicked knife flashed serpent-wise. -- 
    Yet I saw nothing but his eyes,
    And heard one little word he said
    Go echoing down among the Dead.



    They say the Dead may never dream.
    But yet I heard my pierced heart scream
    His name within the dark. They lie
    Who say the Dead can ever die.

    For in the grave I may not sleep
    For dreaming that I hear him weep.
    And in the dark, my dead hands grope
    In search of him. O barren hope!

    I cannot draw his head to rest
    Deep down upon my wounded breast ...
    He gave the breast that fed him well
    To suckle the small worms of Hell.

    The little wicked thoughts that fed
    Upon the weary helpless Dead ...
    They whispered o'er my broken heart,
    They stuck their fangs deep in the smart.

    The child she bore with bloody sweat
    And agony has paid his debt.
    Through that bleak face the stark winds play;
    The crows have chased his soul away.

    His body is a blackened rag
    Upon the tree -- a monstrous flag.
    Thus one worm to the other saith.
    Those slow mean servitors of Death,

    They chuckling said: Your soul, grown blind
    With anguish, is the shrieking Wind
    That blows the flame that never dies
    About his empty, lidless eyes.

    I tore them from my heart. I said:
    The life-blood that my son's hand shed,
    That from my broken heart outburst,
    I'd give again, to quench his thirst.

    He did no sin. But cold blind earth
    The body was that gave him birth.
    All mine, all mine the sin; the love
    I bore him was not deep enough.


Country Sentiment

A FROSTY NIGHT.

        Mother

     Alice, dear, what ails you,
       Dazed and white and shaken?
     Has the chill night numbed you?
       Is it fright you have taken?

        Alice


     Mother, I am very well,
       I felt never better,
     Mother, do not hold me so,
       Let me write my letter.

        Mother

     Sweet, my dear, what ails you?

        Alice

     No, but I am well;
     The night was cold and frosty,
     There's no more to tell.

        Mother

     Ay, the night was frosty,
       Coldly gaped the moon,
     Yet the birds seemed twittering
       Through green boughs of June.

     Soft and thick the snow lay,
       Stars danced in the sky.
     Not all the lambs of May-day
       Skip so bold and high.

     Your feet were dancing, Alice,
       Seemed to dance on air,
     You looked a ghost or angel
       In the starlight there.

     Your eyes were frosted starlight,
     Your heart fire and snow.
     Who was it said, "I love you"?

        Alice

       Mother, let me go!




A SONG FOR TWO CHILDREN.

     "Make a song, father, a new little song,
        All for Jenny and Nancy."
      Balow lalow or Hey derry down,
        Or else what might you fancy?

      Is there any song sweet enough
        For Nancy and for Jenny?
       Said Simple Simon to the pieman,
        "Indeed I know not any."

     "I've counted the miles to Babylon,
        I've flown the earth like a bird,
      I've ridden cock-horse to Banbury Cross,
        But no such song have I heard."

     "Some speak of Alexander,
        And some of Hercules,
      But where are there any like Nancy and Jenny,
        Where are there any like these?"




DICKY.

        Mother

     Oh, what a heavy sigh!
       Dicky, are you ailing?

        Dicky

     Even by this fireside, mother,
       My heart is failing.

     To-night across the down,
       Whistling and jolly,
     I sauntered out from town
       With my stick of holly.

     Bounteous and cool from sea
       The wind was blowing,
     Cloud shadows under the moon
       Coming and going.

     I sang old roaring songs,
       Ran and leaped quick,
     And turned home by St. Swithin's
       Twirling my stick.

     And there as I was passing
       The churchyard gate
     An old man stopped me, "Dicky,
       You're walking late."

     I did not know the man,
       I grew afeared
     At his lean lolling jaw,
       His spreading beard.

     His garments old and musty,
       Of antique cut,
     His body very lean and bony,
       His eyes tight shut.

     Oh, even to tell it now
       My courage ebbs...
     His face was clay, mother,
       His beard, cobwebs.

     In that long horrid pause
       "Good-night," he said,
     Entered and clicked the gate,
       "Each to his bed."

        Mother

     Do not sigh or fear, Dicky,
       How is it right
     To grudge the dead their ghostly dark
       And wan moonlight?

     We have the glorious sun,
       Lamp and fireside.
     Grudge not the dead their moonshine
       When abroad they ride.




THE THREE DRINKERS.

     Blacksmith Green had three strong sons,
       With bread and beef did fill 'em,
     Now John and Ned are perished and dead,
       But plenty remains of William.

     John Green was a whiskey drinker,
       The Land of Cakes supplied him,
     Till at last his soul flew out by the hole
       That the fierce drink burned inside him.

     Ned Green was a water drinker,
       And, Lord, how Ned would fuddle!
     He rotted away his mortal clay
       Like an old boot thrown in a puddle.

     Will Green was a wise young drinker,
       Shrank from whiskey or water,
     But he made good cheer with headstrong beer,
       And married an alderman's daughter.




THE BOY OUT OF CHURCH.

     As Jesus and his followers
       Upon a Sabbath morn
     Were walking by a wheat field
       They plucked the ears of corn.

     They plucked it, they rubbed it,
       They blew the husks away,
     Which grieved the pious pharisees
       Upon the Sabbath day.

     And Jesus said, "A riddle
       Answer if you can,
     Was man made for the Sabbath
       Or Sabbath made for man?"

     I do not love the Sabbath,
       The soapsuds and the starch,
     The troops of solemn people
       Who to Salvation march.

     I take my book, I take my stick
       On the Sabbath day,
     In woody nooks and valleys
       I hide myself away.

     To ponder there in quiet
       God's Universal Plan,
     Resolved that church and Sabbath
       Were never made for man.




AFTER THE PLAY.

        Father

     Have you spent the money I gave you to-day?

        John

       Ay, father I have.
     A fourpence on cakes, two pennies that away
       To a beggar I gave.

        Father

     The lake of yellow brimstone boil for you in Hell,
       Such lies that you spin.
     Tell the truth now, John, ere the falsehood swell,
       Say, where have you been?

        John

     I'll lie no more to you, father, what is the need?
       To the Play I went,
     With sixpence for a near seat, money's worth indeed,
       The best ever spent.

     Grief to you, shame or grief, here is the story -- 
       My splendid night!
     It was colour, scents, music, a tragic glory,
       Fear with delight.

     Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, title of the tale:
       He of that name,
     A tall, glum fellow, velvet cloaked, with a shirt of mail,
       Two eyes like flame.

     All the furies of fate circled round the man,
       Maddening his heart,
     There was old murder done before play began,
       Ay, the ghost took part.

     There were grave-diggers delving, they brought up bones,
       And with rage and grief
     All the players shouted in full, kingly tones,
       Grand, passing belief.

     Oh, there were ladies there radiant like day,
       And changing scenes:
     Great sounding words were tossed about like hay
       By kings and queens.

     How the plot turned about I watched in vain,
       Though for grief I cried,
     As one and all they faded, poisoned or slain,
       In great agony died.

     Father, you'll drive me forth never to return,
       Doubting me your son -- 

        Father

     So I shall, John

        John

     -- but that glory for which I burn
       Shall be soon begun.

     I shall wear great boots, shall strut and shout,
       Keep my locks curled.
     The fame of my name shall go ringing about
       Over half the world.

        Father

     Horror that your Prince found, John may you find,
       Ever and again
     Dying before the house in such torture of mind
       As you need not feign.

     While they clap and stamp at your nightly fate,
       They shall never know
     The curse that drags at you, until Hell's gate.
       You have heard me.  Go!




SONG:  ONE HARD LOOK.

     Small gnats that fly
     In hot July
     And lodge in sleeping ears,
     Can rouse therein
     A trumpet's din
     With Day-of-Judgement fears.

     Small mice at night
     Can wake more fright
     Than lions at midday.
     An urchin small
     Torments us all
     Who tread his prickly way.

     A straw will crack
     The camel's back,
     To die we need but sip,
     So little sand
     As fills the hand
     Can stop a steaming ship.

     One smile relieves
     A heart that grieves
     Though deadly sad it be,
     And one hard look
     Can close the book
     That lovers love to see -- 




TRUE JOHNNY.

     Johnny, sweetheart, can you be true
     To all those famous vows you've made,
     Will you love me as I love you
     Until we both in earth are laid?
     Or shall the old wives nod and say
     His love was only for a day:
       The mood goes by,
       His fancies fly,
     And Mary's left to sigh.

     Mary, alas, you've hit the truth,
     And I with grief can but admit
     Hot-blooded haste controls my youth,
     My idle fancies veer and flit
     From flower to flower, from tree to tree,
     And when the moment catches me,
       Oh, love goes by
       Away I fly
     And leave my girl to sigh.

     Could you but now foretell the day,
     Johnny, when this sad thing must be,
     When light and gay you'll turn away
     And laugh and break the heart in me?
     For like a nut for true love's sake
     My empty heart shall crack and break,
       When fancies fly
       And love goes by
     And Mary's left to die.

     When the sun turns against the clock,
     When Avon waters upward flow,
     When eggs are laid by barn-door cock,
     When dusty hens do strut and crow,
     When up is down, when left is right,
     Oh, then I'll break the troth I plight,
       With careless eye
       Away I'll fly
     And Mary here shall die.




THE VOICE OF BEAUTY DROWNED.

     Cry from the thicket my heart's bird!
     The other birds woke all around,
     Rising with toot and howl they stirred
     Their plumage, broke the trembling sound,
     They craned their necks, they fluttered wings,
     "While we are silent no one sings,
     And while we sing you hush your throat,
     Or tune your melody to our note."

     Cry from the thicket my heart's bird!
     The screams and hootings rose again:
     They gaped with raucous beaks, they whirred
     Their noisy plumage; small but plain
     The lonely hidden singer made
     A well of grief within the glade.
     "Whist, silly fool, be off," they shout,
     "Or we'll come pluck your feathers out."

     Cry from the thicket my heart's bird!
     Slight and small the lovely cry
     Came trickling down, but no one heard.
     Parrot and cuckoo, crow, magpie
     Jarred horrid notes and the jangling jay
     Ripped the fine threads of song away,
     For why should peeping chick aspire
     To challenge their loud woodland choir?

     Cried it so sweet that unseen bird?
     Lovelier could no music be,
     Clearer than water, soft as curd,
     Fresh as the blossomed cherry tree.
     How sang the others all around?
     Piercing and harsh, a maddening sound,
     With Pretty Poll, tuwit-tu-woo,
     Peewit, caw caw, cuckoo-cuckoo.




THE GOD CALLED POETRY.

     Now I begin to know at last,
     These nights when I sit down to rhyme,
     The form and measure of that vast
     God we call Poetry, he who stoops
     And leaps me through his paper hoops
     A little higher every time.

     Tempts me to think I'll grow a proper
     Singing cricket or grass-hopper
     Making prodigious jumps in air
     While shaken crowds about me stare
     Aghast, and I sing, growing bolder
     To fly up on my master's shoulder
     Rustling the thick strands of his hair.

     He is older than the seas,
     Older than the plains and hills,
     And older than the light that spills
     From the sun's hot wheel on these.
     He wakes the gale that tears your trees,
     He sings to you from window sills.

     At you he roars, or he will coo,
     He shouts and screams when hell is hot,
     Riding on the shell and shot.
     He smites you down, he succours you,
     And where you seek him, he is not.

     To-day I see he has two heads
     Like Janus -- calm, benignant, this;
     That, grim and scowling:  his beard spreads
     From chin to chin"  this god has power
     Immeasurable at every hour:
     He first taught lovers how to kiss,
     He brings down sunshine after shower,
     Thunder and hate are his also,
     He is YES and he is NO.

     The black beard spoke and said to me,
     "Human frailty though you be,
     Yet shout and crack your whip, be harsh!
     They'll obey you in the end:
     Hill and field, river and marsh
     Shall obey you, hop and skip
     At the terrour of your whip,
     To your gales of anger bend."

     The pale beard spoke and said in turn
     "True:  a prize goes to the stern,
     But sing and laugh and easily run
     Through the wide airs of my plain,
     Bathe in my waters, drink my sun,
     And draw my creatures with soft song;
     They shall follow you along
     Graciously with no doubt or pain."

     Then speaking from his double head
     The glorious fearful monster said
     "I am YES and I am NO,
     Black as pitch and white as snow,
     Love me, hate me, reconcile
     Hate with love, perfect with vile,
     So equal justice shall be done
     And life shared between moon and sun.
     Nature for you shall curse or smile:
     A poet you shall be, my son."




ROCKY ACRES.

     This is a wild land, country of my choice,
       With harsh craggy mountain, moor ample and bare.
     Seldom in these acres is heard any voice
       But voice of cold water that runs here and there
       Through rocks and lank heather growing without care.
     No mice in the heath run nor no birds cry
     For fear of the dark speck that floats in the sky.

     He soars and he hovers rocking on his wings,
       He scans his wide parish with a sharp eye,
     He catches the trembling of small hidden things,
       He tears them in pieces, dropping from the sky:
       Tenderness and pity the land will deny,
     Where life is but nourished from water and rock
     A hardy adventure, full of fear and shock.

     Time has never journeyed to this lost land,
       Crakeberries and heather bloom out of date,
     The rocks jut, the streams flow singing on either hand,
       Careless if the season be early or late.
       The skies wander overhead, now blue, now slate:
     Winter would be known by his cold cutting snow
     If June did not borrow his armour also.

     Yet this is my country be loved by me best,
       The first land that rose from Chaos and the Flood,
     Nursing no fat valleys for comfort and rest,
       Trampled by no hard hooves, stained with no blood.
       Bold immortal country whose hill tops have stood
     Strongholds for the proud gods when on earth they go,
     Terror for fat burghers in far plains below.




ADVICE TO LOVERS.

     I knew an old man at a Fair
     Who made it his twice-yearly task
     To clamber on a cider cask
     And cry to all the yokels there: -- 

     "Lovers to-day and for all time
      Preserve the meaning of my rhyme:
      Love is not kindly nor yet grim
      But does to you as you to him.

     "Whistle, and Love will come to you,
      Hiss, and he fades without a word,
      Do wrong, and he great wrong will do,
      Speak, he retells what he has heard.

     "Then all you lovers have good heed
      Vex not young Love in word or deed:
      Love never leaves an unpaid debt,
      He will not pardon nor forget."

     The old man's voice was sweet yet loud
     And this shows what a man was he,
     He'd scatter apples to the crowd
     And give great draughts of cider, free.




NEBUCHADNEZZAR'S FALL.

     Frowning over the riddle that Daniel told,
     Down through the mist hung garden, below a feeble sun,
     The King of Persia walked:  oh, the chilling cold!
     His mind was webbed with a grey shroud vapour-spun.

     Here for the pride of his soaring eagle heart,
     Here for his great hand searching the skies for food,
     Here for his courtship of Heaven's high stars he shall smart,
     Nebuchadnezzar shall fall, crawl, be subdued.

     Hot sun struck through the vapour, leaf strewn mould
     Breathed sweet decay:  old Earth called for her child.
     Mist drew off from his mind, Sun scattered gold,
     Warmth came and earthy motives fresh and wild.

     Down on his knees he sinks, the stiff-necked King,
     Stoops and kneels and grovels, chin to the mud.
     Out from his changed heart flutter on startled wing
     The fancy birds of his Pride, Honour, Kinglihood.

     He crawls, he grunts, he is beast-like, frogs and snails
     His diet, and grass, and water with hand for cup.
     He herds with brutes that have hooves and horns and tails,
     He roars in his anger, he scratches, he looks not up.



GIVE US RAIN.

     "Give us Rain, Rain," said the bean and the pea,
       "Not so much Sun,
       Not so much Sun."
     But the Sun smiles bravely and encouragingly,
     And no rain falls and no waters run.

     "Give us Peace, Peace," said the peoples oppressed,
       "Not so many Flags,
       Not so many Flags."
     But the Flags fly and the Drums beat, denying rest,
     And the children starve, they shiver in rags.




ALLIE.

     Allie, call the birds in,
       The birds from the sky.
     Allie calls, Allie sings,
       Down they all fly.
     First there came
     Two white doves
       Then a sparrow from his nest,
     Then a clucking bantam hen,
       Then a robin red-breast.

     Allie, call the beasts in,
       The beasts, every one.
     Allie calls, Allie sings,
       In they all run.
     First there came
     Two black lambs,
       Then a grunting Berkshire sow,
     Then a dog without a tail,
       Then a red and white cow.

     Allie, call the fish up,
       The fish from the stream.
     Allie calls, Allie sings,
       Up they all swim.
     First there came
     Two gold fish,
       A minnow and a miller's thumb,
     Then a pair of loving trout,
       Then the twisted eels come.

     Allie, call the children,
       Children from the green.
     Allie calls, Allie sings,
       Soon they run in.
     First there came
     Tom and Madge,
       Kate and I who'll not forget
     How we played by the water's edge
       Till the April sun set.




LOVING HENRY.

     Henry, Henry, do you love me?
     Do I love you, Mary?
     Oh, can you mean to liken me
     To the aspen tree.
     Whose leaves do shake and vary,
     From white to green
     And back again,
     Shifting and contrary?

     Henry, Henry, do you love me,
     Do you love me truly?
     Oh, Mary, must I say again
     My love's a pain,
     A torment most unruly?
     It tosses me
     Like a ship at sea
     When the storm rages fully.

     Henry, Henry, why do you love me?
     Mary, dear, have pity!
     I swear, of all the girls there are
     Both near and far,
     In country or in city,
     There's none like you,
     So kind, so true,
     So wise, so brave, so pretty.




BRITTLE BONES.

     Though I am an old man
       With my bones very brittle,
     Though I am a poor old man
       Worth very little,
     Yet I suck at my long pipe
       At peace in the sun,
     I do not fret nor much regret
       That my work is done.

     If I were a young man
       With my bones full of marrow,
     Oh, if I were a bold young man
       Straight as an arrow,
     And if I had the same years
       To live once again,
     I would not change their simple range
       Of laughter and pain.

     If I were a young man
       And young was my Lily,
     A smart girl, a bold young man,
       Both of us silly.
     And though from time before I knew
       She'd stab me with pain,
     Though well I knew she'd not be true,
       I'd love her again.

     If I were a young man
       With a brisk, healthy body,
     Oh, if I were a bold young man
       With love of rum toddy,
     Though I knew that I was spiting
       My old age with pain,
     My happy lip would touch and sip
       Again and again.

     If I were a young man
       With my bones full of marrow,
     Oh, if I were a bold young man
       Straight as an arrow,
     I'd store up no virtue
       For Heaven's distant plain,
     I'd live at ease as I did please
       And sin once again.




APPLES AND WATER.

     Dust in a cloud, blinding weather,
       Drums that rattle and roar!
     A mother and daughter stood together
       Beside their cottage door.

     "Mother, the heavens are bright like brass,
       The dust is shaken high,
     With labouring breath the soldiers pass,
       Their lips are cracked and dry."

     "Mother, I'll throw them apples down,
       I'll bring them pails of water."
     The mother turned with an angry frown
       Holding back her daughter.

     "But mother, see, they faint with thirst,
       They march away to die,"
     "Ah, sweet, had I but known at first
       Their throats are always dry."

     "There is no water can supply them
       In western streams that flow,
     There is no fruit can satisfy them
       On orchard trees that grow."

     "Once in my youth I gave, poor fool,
       A soldier apples and water,
     So may I die before you cool
       Your father's drouth, my daughter."




MANTICOR IN ARABIA.


     Thick and scented daisies spread
     Where with surface dull like lead
     Arabian pools of slime invite
     Manticors down from neighbouring height
     To dip heads, to cool fiery blood
     In oozy depths of sucking mud.
     Sing then of ringstraked manticor,
     Man-visaged tiger who of yore
     Held whole Arabian waste in fee
     With raging pride from sea to sea,
     That every lesser tribe would fly
     Those armed feet, that hooded eye;
     Till preying on himself at last
     Manticor dwindled, sank, was passed
     By gryphon flocks he did disdain.
     Ay, wyverns and rude dragons reign
     In ancient keep of manticor
     Agreed old foe can rise no more.
     Only here from lakes of slime
     Drinks manticor and bides due time:
     Six times Fowl Phoenix in yon tree
     Must mount his pyre and burn and be
     Renewed again, till in such hour
     As seventh Phoenix flames to power
     And lifts young feathers, overnice
     From scented pool of steamy spice
     Shall manticor his sway restore
     And rule Arabian plains once more.




OUTLAWS.

     Owls:  they whinney down the night,
       Bats go zigzag by.
     Ambushed in shadow out of sight
       The outlaws lie.

     Old gods, shrunk to shadows, there
       In the wet woods they lurk,
     Greedy of human stuff to snare
       In webs of murk.

     Look up, else your eye must drown
       In a moving sea of black
     Between the tree-tops, upside down
       Goes the sky-track.

     Look up, else your feet will stray
       Towards that dim ambuscade,
     Where spider-like they catch their prey
       In nets of shade.

     For though creeds whirl away in dust,
       Faith fails and men forget,
     These aged gods of fright and lust
       Cling to life yet.

     Old gods almost dead, malign,
       Starved of their ancient dues,
     Incense and fruit, fire, blood and wine
       And an unclean muse.

     Banished to woods and a sickly moon,
       Shrunk to mere bogey things,
     Who spoke with thunder once at noon
       To prostrate kings.

     With thunder from an open sky
       To peasant, tyrant, priest,
     Bowing in fear with a dazzled eye
       Towards the East.

     Proud gods, humbled, sunk so low,
       Living with ghosts and ghouls,
     And ghosts of ghosts and last year's snow
       And dead toadstools.




BALOO LOO FOR JENNY.

     Sing baloo loo for Jenny
       And where is she gone?
     Away to spy her mother's land,
       Riding all alone.

     To the rich towns of Scotland,
       The woods and the streams,
     High upon a Spanish horse
       Saddled for her dreams.

     By Oxford and by Chester,
       To Berwick-on-the-Tweed,
     Then once across the borderland
       She shall find no need.

     A loaf for her at Stirling,
       A scone at Carlisle,
     Honeyed cakes at Edinbro' -- 
       That shall make her smile.

     At Aberdeen clear cider,
       Mead for her at Nairn,
     A cup of wine at John o' Groats -- 
       That shall please my bairn.

     Sing baloo loo for Jenny,
       Mother will be fain
     To see her little truant child
       Riding home again.




HAWK AND BUCKLE.

     Where is the landlord of old Hawk and Buckle,
     And what of Master Straddler this hot summer weather?
     He's along in the tap-room with broad cheeks a-chuckle,
     And ten bold companions all drinking together.

     Where is the daughter of old Hawk and Buckle,
     And what of Mistress Jenny this hot summer weather?
     She sits in the parlour with smell of honeysuckle,
     Trimming her bonnet with red ostrich feather.

     Where is the ostler of old Hawk and Buckle,
     And what of Willy Jakeman this hot summer weather?
     He is rubbing his eyes with a slow and lazy knuckle
     As he wakes from his nap on a bank of fresh heather.

     Where is the page boy of old Hawk and Buckle,
     And what of our young Charlie this hot summer weather?
     He is bobbing for tiddlers in a little trickle-truckle,
     With his line and his hook and his breeches of leather.

     Where is the grey goat of old Hawk and Buckle,
     And what of pretty Nanny this hot summer weather?
     She stays not contented with little or with muckle,
     Straining for daisies at the end of her tether.

     For this is our motto at old Hawk and Buckle,
     We cling to it close and we sing all together,
     "Every man for himself at our old Hawk and Buckle,
     And devil take the hindmost this hot summer weather."




THE "ALICE JEAN".

     One moonlit night a ship drove in,
       A ghost ship from the west,
     Drifting with bare mast and lone tiller,
       Like a mermaid drest
     In long green weed and barnacles:
       She beached and came to rest.

     All the watchers of the coast
       Flocked to view the sight,
     Men and women streaming down
       Through the summer night,
     Found her standing tall and ragged
       Beached in the moonlight.

     Then one old woman looked and wept
       "The `Alice Jean`?  But no!
     The ship that took my Dick from me
       Sixty years ago
     Drifted back from the utmost west
       With the ocean's flow?

     "Caught and caged in the weedy pool
       Beyond the western brink,
     Where crewless vessels lie and rot
       in waters black as ink.
     Torn out again by a sudden storm
       Is it the `Jean`, you think?"

     A hundred women stared agape,
       The menfolk nudged and laughed,
     But none could find a likelier story
       For the strange craft.
     With fear and death and desolation
       Rigged fore and aft.

     The blind ship came forgotten home
       To all but one of these
     Of whom none dared to climb aboard her:
       And by and by the breeze
     Sprang to a storm and the "Alice Jean"
       Foundered in frothy seas.




THE CUPBOARD.

        Mother

     What's in that cupboard, Mary?

        Mary

     Which cupboard, mother dear?

        Mother

     The cupboard of red mahogany
       With handles shining clear.

        Mary

     That cupboard, dearest mother,
       With shining crystal handles?
     There's nought inside but rags and jags
       And yellow tallow candles.

        Mother

     What's in that cupboard, Mary?

        Mary

     Which cupboard, mother mine?

        Mother

     That cupboard stands in your sunny chamber,
       The silver corners shine.

        Mary

     There's nothing there inside, mother,
       But wool and thread and flax,
     And bits of faded silk and velvet,
       And candles of white wax.

        Mother

     What's in that cupboard, Mary?
       And this time tell me true.

        Mary

     White clothes for an unborn baby, mother,
       But what's the truth to you?




THE BEACON.

     The silent shepherdess,
       She of my vows,
     Here with me exchanging love
       Under dim boughs.

     Shines on our mysteries
       A sudden spark -- 
     "Dout the candle, glow-worm,
       Let all be dark.

     "The birds have sung their last notes,
       The Sun's to bed,
     Glow-worm, dout your candle."
       The glow-worm said:

     "I also am a lover;
       The lamp I display
     Is beacon for my true love
       Wandering astray.

     "Through the thick bushes
       And the grass comes she
     With a heartload of longing
       And love for me.

     "Sir, enjoy your fancy,
       But spare me harm,
     A lover is a lover,
       Though but a worm."




POT AND KETTLE.

     Come close to me, dear Annie, while I bind a lover's knot.
     A tale of burning love between a kettle and a pot.
     The pot was stalwart iron and the kettle trusty tin,
     And though their sides were black with smoke they bubbled love within.

     Forget that kettle, Jamie, and that pot of boiling broth,
     I know a dismal story of a candle and a moth.
     For while your pot is boiling and while your kettle sings
     My moth makes love to candle flame and burns away his wings.

     Your moth, I envy, Annie, that died by candle flame,
     But here are two more lovers, unto no damage came.
     There was a cuckoo loved a clock and found her always true.
     For every hour they told their hearts, "Ring! ting!  Cuckoo!  Cuckoo!"

     As the pot boiled for the kettle, as the kettle for the pot,
     So boils my love within me till my breast is glowing hot.
     As the moth died for the candle, so could I die for you.
     And my fond heart beats time with yours and cries, "Cuckoo!  Cuckoo!"




GHOST RADDLED.

     "Come, surly fellow, come!  A song!"
       What, madmen?  Sing to you?
     Choose from the clouded tales of wrong
       And terror I bring to you.

     Of a night so torn with cries,
       Honest men sleeping
     Start awake with glaring eyes,
       Bone-chilled, flesh creeping.

     Of spirits in the web hung room
       Up above the stable,
     Groans, knockings in the gloom,
       The dancing table.

     Of demons in the dry well
       That cheep and mutter,
     Clanging of an unseen bell,
       Blood choking the gutter.

     Of lust frightful, past belief,
       Lurking unforgotten,
     Unrestrainable endless grief
       From breasts long rotten.

     A song?  What laughter or what song
       Can this house remember?
     Do flowers and butterflies belong
       To a blind December?




NEGLECTFUL EDWARD.

        Nancy

     "Edward back from the Indian Sea,
     What have you brought for Nancy?"

        Edward

     "A rope of pearls and a gold earring,
     And a bird of the East that will not sing.
     A carven tooth, a box with a key -- "

        Nancy

     "God be praised you are back," says she,
     "Have you nothing more for your Nancy?"

        Edward

     "Long as I sailed the Indian Sea
     I gathered all for your fancy:
     Toys and silk and jewels I bring,
     And a bird of the East that will not sing:
     What more can you want, dear girl, from me?"

        Nancy

     "God be praised you are back," said she,
     "Have you nothing better for Nancy?"

        Edward

     "Safe and home from the Indian Sea,
     And nothing to take your fancy?"


        Nancy

     "You can keep your pearls and your gold earring,
     And your bird of the East that will not sing,
     But, Ned, have you nothing more for me
     Than heathenish gew-gaw toys?" says she,
     "Have you nothing better for Nancy?"




THE WELL-DRESSED CHILDREN.

     Here's flowery taffeta for Mary's new gown:
       Here's black velvet, all the rage, for Dick's birthday coat.
     Pearly buttons for you, Mary, all the way down,
       Lace ruffles, Dick, for you; you'll be a man of note.

     Mary, here I've bought you a green gingham shade
       And a silk purse brocaded with roses gold and blue,
     You'll learn to hold them proudly like colours on parade.
       No banker's wife in all the town half so grand as you.

     I've bought for young Diccon a long walking-stick,
       Yellow gloves, well tanned, at Woodstock village made.
     I'll teach you to flourish 'em and show your name is DICK,
       Strutting by your sister's side with the same parade.

     On Sunday to church you go, each with a book of prayer:
       Then up the street and down the aisles, everywhere you'll see
     Of all the honours paid around, how small is Virtue's share.
       How large the share of Vulgar Pride in peacock finery.




THUNDER AT NIGHT.

     Restless and hot two children lay
       Plagued with uneasy dreams,
     Each wandered lonely through false day
       A twilight torn with screams.

     True to the bed-time story, Ben
       Pursued his wounded bear,
     Ann dreamed of chattering monkey men,
       Of snakes twined in her hair...

     Now high aloft above the town
       The thick clouds gather and break,
     A flash, a roar, and rain drives down:
       Aghast the young things wake.

     Trembling for what their terror was,
       Surprised by instant doom,
     With lightning in the looking glass,
       Thunder that rocks the room.

     The monkeys' paws patter again,
       Snakes hiss and flash their eyes:
     The bear roars out in hideous pain:
       Ann prays:  her brother cries.

     They cannot guess, could not be told
       How soon comes careless day,
     With birds and dandelion gold,
       Wet grass, cool scents of May.




A BALLAD OF NURSERY RHYME.

     Strawberries that in gardens grow
       Are plump and juicy fine,
     But sweeter far as wise men know
       Spring from the woodland vine.

     No need for bowl or silver spoon,
       Sugar or spice or cream,
     Has the wild berry plucked in June
       Beside the trickling stream.

     One such to melt at the tongue's root,
       Confounding taste with scent,
     Beats a full peck of garden fruit:
       Which points my argument.

     May sudden justice overtake
       And snap the froward pen,
     That old and palsied poets shake
       Against the minds of men.

     Blasphemers trusting to hold caught
       In far-flung webs of ink,
     The utmost ends of human thought
       Till nothing's left to think.

     But may the gift of heavenly peace
       And glory for all time
     Keep the boy Tom who tending geese
       First made the nursery rhyme.

     By the brookside one August day,
       Using the sun for clock,
     Tom whiled the languid hours away
       Beside his scattering flock.

     Carving with a sharp pointed stone
       On a broad slab of slate
     The famous lives of Jumping Joan,
       Dan Fox and Greedy Kate.

     Rhyming of wolves and bears and birds,
       Spain, Scotland, Babylon,
     That sister Kate might learn the words
       To tell to toddling John.

     But Kate who could not stay content
       To learn her lesson pat
     New beauty to the rough lines lent
       By changing this or that.

     And she herself set fresh things down
       In corners of her slate,
     Of lambs and lanes and London town.
       God's blessing fall on Kate!

     The baby loved the simple sound,
       With jolly glee he shook,
     And soon the lines grew smooth and round
       Like pebbles in Tom's brook.

     From mouth to mouth told and retold
       By children sprawled at ease,
     Before the fire in winter's cold,
       in June, beneath tall trees.

     Till though long lost are stone and slate,
       Though the brook no more runs,
     And dead long time are Tom, John, Kate,
       Their sons and their sons' sons.

     Yet as when Time with stealthy tread
       Lays the rich garden waste
     The woodland berry ripe and red
       Fails not in scent or taste,

     So these same rhymes shall still be told
       To children yet unborn,
     While false philosophy growing old
       Fades and is killed by scorn.




JANE.

     As Jane walked out below the hill,
     She saw an old man standing still,
     His eyes in tranced sorrow bound
     On the broad stretch of barren ground.

     His limbs were knarled like aged trees,
     His thin beard wrapt about his knees,
     His visage broad and parchment white,
     Aglint with pale reflected light.

     He seemed a creature fall'n afar
     From some dim planet or faint star.
     Jane scanned him very close, and soon
     Cried, "'Tis the old man from the moon."

     He raised his voice, a grating creak,
     But only to himself would speak.
     Groaning with tears in piteous pain,
     "O! O! would I were home again."

     Then Jane ran off, quick as she could,
     To cheer his heart with drink and food.
     But ah, too late came ale and bread,
     She found the poor soul stretched stone-dead.
     And a new moon rode overhead.




VAIN AND CARELESS.

     Lady, lovely lady,
       Careless and gay!
     Once when a beggar called
       She gave her child away.

     The beggar took the baby,
       Wrapped it in a shawl,
     "Bring her back," the lady said,
       "Next time you call."

     Hard by lived a vain man,
       So vain and so proud,
     He walked on stilts
       To be seen by the crowd.

     Up above the chimney pots,
       Tall as a mast,
     And all the people ran about
       Shouting till he passed.

     "A splendid match surely,"
       Neighbours saw it plain,
     "Although she is so careless,
       Although he is so vain."

     But the lady played bobcherry,
       Did not see or care,
     As the vain man went by her
       Aloft in the air.

     This gentle-born couple
       Lived and died apart.
     Water will not mix with oil,
       Nor vain with careless heart.




NINE O'CLOCK.


     Nine of the clock, oh!
       Wake my lazy head!
     Your shoes of red morocco,
       Your silk bed-gown:
     Rouse, rouse, speck-eyed Mary
       In your high bed!
     A yawn, a smile, sleepy-starey,
       Mary climbs down.
     "Good-morning to my brothers,
       Good-day to the Sun,
     Halloo, halloo to the lily-white sheep
       That up the mountain run."


     Good-night to the meadow, farewell to the nine o'clock Sun,
     "He loves me not, loves me, he loves me not" (O jealous one!)
     "He loves me, he loves me not, loves me" -- O soft nights of June,
     A bird sang for love on the cherry-bough:  up swam the Moon.




THE PICTURE BOOK.

     When I was not quite five years old
       I first saw the blue picture book,
     And Fraulein Spitzenburger told
     Stories that sent me hot and cold;
       I loathed it, yet I had to look:
       It was a German book.

     I smiled at first, for she'd begun
       With a back-garden broad and green,
     And rabbits nibbling there:  page one
     Turned; and the gardener fired his gun
       From the low hedge:  he lay unseen
       Behind:  oh, it was mean!

     They're hurt, they can't escape, and so
       He stuffs them head-down in a sack,
     Not quite dead, wriggling in a row,
     And Fraulein laughed, "Ho, ho!  Ho, ho!"
       And gave my middle a hard smack,
       I wish that I'd hit back.

     Then when I cried she laughed again;
       On the next page was a dead boy
     Murdered by robbers in a lane;
     His clothes were red with a big stain
       Of blood, he held a broken toy,
       The poor, poor little boy!

     I had to look:  there was a town
       Burning where every one got caught,
     Then a fish pulled a nigger down
     Into the lake and made him drown,
       And a man killed his friend; they fought
       For money, Fraulein thought.

     Old Fraulein laughed, a horrid noise.
       "Ho, ho!"  Then she explained it all
     How robbers kill the little boys
     And torture them and break their toys.
       Robbers are always big and tall:
       I cried:  I was so small.

     How a man often kills his wife,
       How every one dies in the end
     By fire, or water or a knife.
     If you're not careful in this life,
       Even if you can trust your friend,
       You won't have long to spend.

     I hated it -- old Fraulein picked
       Her teeth, slowly explaining it.
     I had to listen, Fraulein licked
     Her fingers several times and flicked
       The pages over; in a fit
       Of rage I spat at it...

     And lying in my bed that night
       Hungry, tired out with sobs, I found
     A stretch of barren years in sight,
     Where right is wrong, but strength is right,
       Where weak things must creep underground,
       And I could not sleep sound.




THE PROMISED LULLABY.

     Can I find True-Love a gift
       In this dark hour to restore her,
     When body's vessel breaks adrift,
       When hope and beauty fade before her?
     But in this plight I cannot think
       Of song or music, that would grieve her,
     Or toys or meat or snow-cooled drink;
       Not this way can her sadness leave her.
       She lies and frets in childish fever,
     All I can do is but to cry
     "Sleep, sleep, True-Love and lullaby!"

     Lullaby, and sleep again.
       Two bright eyes through the window stare,
     A nose is flattened on the pane
       And infant fingers fumble there.
     "Not yet, not yet, you lovely thing,
       But count and come nine weeks from now,
     When winter's tail has lost the sting,
       When buds come striking through the bough,
       Then here's True-Love will show you how
     Her name she won, will hush your cry
     With "Sleep, my baby!  Lullaby!"




RETROSPECT


     HAUNTED.

     Gulp down your wine, old friends of mine,
     Roar through the darkness, stamp and sing
     And lay ghost hands on everything,
     But leave the noonday's warm sunshine
     To living lads for mirth and wine.

     I met you suddenly down the street,
     Strangers assume your phantom faces,
     You grin at me from daylight places,
     Dead, long dead, I'm ashamed to greet
     Dead men down the morning street.




RETROSPECT:  THE JESTS OF THE CLOCK.

     He had met hours of the clock he never guessed  before -- 
     Dumb, dragging, mirthless hours confused with dreams and fear,
     Bone-chilling, hungry hours when the gods sleep and snore,
     Bequeathing earth and heaven to ghosts, and will not hear,
     And will not hear man groan chained to the sodden ground,
     Rotting alive; in feather beds they slumbered sound.

     When noisome smells of day were sicklied by cold night,
     When sentries froze and muttered; when beyond the wire
     Blank shadows crawled and tumbled, shaking, tricking the sight,
     When impotent hatred of Life stifled desire,
     Then soared the sudden rocket, broke in blanching showers.
     O lagging watch!  O dawn!  O hope-forsaken hours!

     How often with numbed heart, stale lips, venting his rage
     He swore he'd be a dolt, a traitor, a damned fool,
     If, when the guns stopped, ever again from youth to age
     He broke the early-rising, early-sleeping rule.
     No, though more bestial enemies roused a fouler war
     Never again would he bear this, no never more!

     "Rise with the cheerful sun, go to bed with the same,
     Work in your field or kailyard all the shining day,
     But," he said, "never more in quest of wealth, honour, fame,
     Search the small hours of night before the East goes grey.
     A healthy mind, a honest heart, a wise man leaves
     Those ugly impious times to ghosts, devils, soldiers, thieves."

     Poor fool, knowing too well deep in his heart
     That he'll be ready again if urgent orders come,
     To quit his rye and cabbages, kiss his wife and part
     At the first sullen rapping of the awakened drum,
     Ready once more to sweat with fear and brace for the shock,
     To greet beneath a falling flare the jests of the clock.




HERE THEY LIE.

     Here they lie who once learned here
       All that is taught of hurt or fear;
     Dead, but by free will they died:
       They were true men, they had pride.




TOM TAYLOR.

     On pay-day nights, neck-full with beer,
     Old soldiers stumbling homeward here,
     Homeward (still dazzled by the spark
     Love kindled in some alley dark)
     Young soldiers mooning in slow thought,
     Start suddenly, turn about, are caught
     By a dancing sound, merry as a grig,
     Tom Taylor's piccolo playing jig.
     Never was blown from human cheeks
     Music like this, that calls and speaks
     Till sots and lovers from one string
     Dangle and dance in the same ring.
     Tom, of your piping I've heard said
     And seen -- that you can rouse the dead,
     Dead-drunken men awash who lie
     In stinking gutters hear your cry,
     I've seen them twitch, draw breath, grope, sigh,
     Heave up, sway, stand; grotesquely then
     You set them dancing, these dead men.
     They stamp and prance with sobbing breath,
     Victims of wine or love or death,
     In ragged time they jump, they shake
     Their heads, sweating to overtake
     The impetuous tune flying ahead.
     They flounder after, with legs of lead.
     Now, suddenly as it started, play
     Stops, the short echo dies away,
     The corpses drop, a senseless heap,
     The drunk men gaze about like sheep.
     Grinning, the lovers sigh and stare
     Up at the broad moon hanging there,
     While Tom, five fingers to his nose,
     Skips off...And the last bugle blows.




COUNTRY AT WAR.

     And what of home -- how goes it, boys,
     While we die here in stench and noise?
     "The hill stands up and hedges wind
     Over the crest and drop behind;
     Here swallows dip and wild things go
     On peaceful errands to and fro
     Across the sloping meadow floor,
     And make no guess at blasting war.
     In woods that fledge the round hill-shoulder
     Leaves shoot and open, fall and moulder,
     And shoot again.  Meadows yet show
     Alternate white of drifted snow
     And daisies.  Children play at shop,
     Warm days, on the flat boulder-top,
     With wildflower coinage, and the wares
     Are bits of glass and unripe pears.
     Crows perch upon the backs of sheep,
     The wheat goes yellow:  women reap,
     Autumn winds ruffle brook and pond,
     Flutter the hedge and fly beyond.
     So the first things of nature run,
     And stand not still for any one,
     Contemptuous of the distant cry
     Wherewith you harrow earth and sky.
     And high French clouds, praying to be
     Back, back in peace beyond the sea,
     Where nature with accustomed round
     Sweeps and garnishes the ground
     With kindly beauty, warm or cold -- 
     Alternate seasons never old:
     Heathen, how furiously you rage,
     Cursing this blood and brimstone age,
     How furiously against your will
     You kill and kill again, and kill:
     All thought of peace behind you cast,
     Till like small boys with fear aghast,
     Each cries for God to understand,
     `I could not help it, it was my hand.`"




     (The Little Saucepan)

     Four collier lads from Ebbw Vale
     Took shelter from a shower of hail,
     And there beneath a spreading tree
     Attuned their mouths to harmony.

     With smiling joy on every face
     Two warbled tenor, two sang bass,
     And while the leaves above them hissed with
     Rough hail, they started "Aberystwyth."

     Old Parry's hymn, triumphant, rich,
     They changed through with even pitch,
     Till at the end of their grand noise
     I called:  "Give us the `Sospan` boys!"

     Who knows a tune so soft, so strong,
     So pitiful as that "Saucepan" song
     For exiled hope, despaired desire
     Of lost souls for their cottage fire?

     Then low at first with gathering sound
     Rose their four voices, smooth and round,
     Till back went Time:  once more I stood
     With Fusiliers in Mametz Wood.

     Fierce burned the sun, yet cheeks were pale,
     For ice hail they had leaden hail;
     In that fine forest, green and big,
     There stayed unbroken not one twig.

     They sang, they swore, they plunged in haste,
     Stumbling and shouting through the waste;
     The little "Saucepan" flamed on high,
     Emblem of hope and ease gone by.

     Rough pit-boys from the coaly South,
     They sang, even in the cannon's mouth;
     Like Sunday's chapel, Monday's inn,
     The death-trap sounded with their din.

     ***

     The storm blows over, Sun comes out,
     The choir breaks up with jest and shout,
     With what relief I watch them part -- 
     Another note would break my heart!




THE LEVELLER.

     Near Martinpuisch that night of hell
     Two men were struck by the same shell,
     Together tumbling in one heap
     Senseless and limp like slaughtered sheep.

     One was a pale eighteen-year-old,
     Girlish and thin and not too bold,
     Pressed for the war ten years too soon,
     The shame and pity of his platoon.

     The other came from far-off lands
     With bristling chin and whiskered hands,
     He had known death and hell before
     In Mexico and Ecuador.

     Yet in his death this cut-throat wild
     Groaned "Mother!  Mother!" like a child,
     While that poor innocent in man's clothes
     Died cursing God with brutal oaths.

     Old Sergeant Smith, kindest of men,
     Wrote out two copies there and then
     Of his accustomed funeral speech
     To cheer the womenfolk of each.




HATE NOT, FEAR NOT.

     Kill if you must, but never hate:
       Man is but grass and hate is blight,
     The sun will scorch you soon or late,
       Die wholesome then, since you must fight.

     Hate is a fear, and fear is rot
       That cankers root and fruit alike,
     Fight cleanly then, hate not, fear not,
       Strike with no madness when you strike.

     Fever and fear distract the world,
       But calm be you though madmen shout,
     Through blazing fires of battle hurled,
       Hate not, strike, fear not, stare Death out!




A RHYME OF FRIENDS.


     Listen now this time
     Shortly to my rhyme
     That herewith starts
     About certain kind hearts
     In those stricken parts
     That lie behind Calais,
     Old crones and aged men
     And young children.
     About the Picardais,
     Who earned my thousand thanks,
     Dwellers by the banks
     Of mournful Somme
     (God keep me therefrom
     Until War ends) -- 
     These, then, are my friends:
     Madame Averlant Lune,
     From the town of Bethune;
     Good Professeur la Brune
     From that town also.
     He played the piccolo,
     And left his locks to grow.
     Dear Madame Hojdes,
     Sempstress of Saint Fe.
     With Jules and Susette
     And Antoinette.
     Her children, my sweethearts,
     For whom I made darts
     Of paper to throw
     In their mimic show,
     "La guerre aux tranchees."
     That was a pretty play.

       There was old Jacques Caron,
     Of the hamlet Mailleton.
     He let me look
     At his household book,
     "Comment vivre cent ans."
     What cares I took
     To obey this wise book,
     I, who feared each hour
     Lest Death's cruel power
     On the poppied plain
     Might make cares vain!

       By Noeus-les-mines
     Lived old Adelphine,
     Withered and clean,
     She nodded and smiled,
     And used me like a child.
     How that old trot beguiled
     My leisure with her chatter,
     Gave me a china platter
     Painted with Cherubim
     And mottoes on the rim.
     But when instead of thanks
     I gave her francs
     How her pride was hurt!
     She counted francs as dirt,
     (God knows, she was not rich)
     She called the Kaiser bitch,
     She spat on the floor,
     Cursing this Prussian war,
     That she had known before
     Forty years past and more.

       There was also "Tomi,"
     With looks sweet and free,
     Who called me cher ami.
     This orphan's age was nine,
     His folk were in their graves,
     Else they were slaves
     Behind the German line
     To terror and rapine -- 
     O, little friends of mine
     How kind and brave you were,
     You smoothed away care
     When life was hard to bear.
     And you, old women and men,
     Who gave me billets then,
     How patient and great-hearted!
     Strangers though we started,
     Yet friends we ever parted.
     God bless you all:  now ends
     This homage to my friends.




A FIRST REVIEW.

     Love, Fear and Hate and Childish Toys
       Are here discreetly blent;
     Admire, you ladies, read, you boys,
       My Country Sentiment.

     But Kate says, "Cut that anger and fear,
       True love's the stuff we need!
     With laughing children and the running deer
       That makes a book indeed."

     Then Tom, a hard and bloody chap,
       Though much beloved by me,
     "Robert, have done with nursery pap,
       Write like a man," says he.

     Hate and Fear are not wanted here,
       Nor Toys nor Country Lovers,
     Everything they took from my new poem book
       But the flyleaf and the covers.


Hymen


    _They said:
    she is high and far and blind
    in her high pride,
    but now that my head is bowed
    in sorrow, I find
    she is most kind._

    _We have taken life, they said,
    blithely, not groped in a mist
    for things that are not -- 
    are if you will, but bloodless -- 
    why ask happiness of the dead?
    and my heart bled._

    _Ah, could they know
    how violets throw strange fire,
    red and purple and gold,
    how they glow
    gold and purple and red
    where her feet tread._




HYMEN


_As from a temple service, tall and dignified, with slow pace, each a
queen, the sixteen matrons from the temple of Hera pass before the
curtain -- a dark purple hung between Ionic columns -- of the porch or open
hall of a palace. Their hair is bound as the marble hair of the temple
Hera. Each wears a crown or diadem of gold._

_They sing -- the music is temple music, deep, simple, chanting notes:_

    From the closed garden
    Where our feet pace
    Back and forth each day,
    This gladiolus white,
    This red, this purple spray -- 
    Gladiolus tall with dignity
    As yours, lady -- we lay
    Before your feet and pray:

    Of all the blessings -- 
    Youth, joy, ecstasy -- 
    May one gift last
    (As the tall gladiolus may
    Outlast the wind-flower,
    Winter-rose or rose),
    One gift above,
    Encompassing all those;

    For her, for him,
    For all within these palace walls,
    Beyond the feast,
    Beyond the cry of Hymen and the torch,
    Beyond the night and music
    Echoing through the porch till day.

_The music, with its deep chanting notes, dies away. The curtain hangs
motionless in rich, full folds. Then from this background of darkness,
dignity and solemn repose, a flute gradually detaches itself, becomes
clearer and clearer, pipes alone one shrill, simple little melody._

_From the distance, four children's voices blend with the flute, and
four very little girls pass singly before the curtain, small maids or
attendants of the sixteen matrons. Their hair is short and curls at the
back of their heads like the hair of the chryselephantine Hermes. They
sing:_

    Where the first crocus buds unfold
    We found these petals near the cold
      Swift river-bed.

    Beneath the rocks where ivy-frond
    Puts forth new leaves to gleam beyond
      Those lately dead:

    The very smallest two or three
    Of gold (gold pale as ivory)
      We gathered.

_When the little girls have passed before the curtain, a wood-wind
weaves a richer note into the flute melody; then the two blend into one
song. But as the wood-wind grows in mellowness and richness, the flute
gradually dies away into a secondary theme and the wood-wind alone
evolves the melody of a new song._

_Two by two -- like two sets of medallions with twin profiles distinct,
one head slightly higher, bent forward a little -- the four figures of
four slight, rather fragile taller children, are outlined with sharp
white contour against the curtain._

_The hair is smooth against the heads, falling to the shoulders but
slightly waved against the nape of the neck. They are looking down, each
at a spray of winter-rose. The tunics fall to the knees in sharp marble
folds. They sing:_

    Never more will the wind
    Cherish you again,
    Never more will the rain.

    Never more
    Shall we find you bright
    In the snow and wind.

    The snow is melted,
    The snow is gone,
    And you are flown:

    Like a bird out of our hand,
    Like a light out of our heart,
    You are gone.

_As the wistful notes of the wood-wind gradually die away, there comes a
sudden, shrill, swift piping._

_Free and wild, like the wood-maidens of Artemis, is this last group of
four -- very straight with heads tossed back. They sing in rich, free,
swift notes. They move swiftly before the curtain in contrast to the
slow, important pace of the first two groups. Their hair is loose and
rayed out like that of the sun-god. They are boyish in shape and
gesture. They carry hyacinths in baskets, strapped like quivers to their
backs. They reach to draw the flower sprays from the baskets, as the
Huntress her arrows._

_As they dart swiftly to and fro before the curtain, they are youth,
they are spring -- they are the Chelidonia, their song is the swallow-song
of joy:_

    Between the hollows
    Of the little hills
    The spring spills blue -- 
    Turquoise, sapphire, lapis-lazuli
    On a brown cloth outspread.

    Ah see,
    How carefully we lay them now,
    Each hyacinth spray,
    Across the marble floor -- 
    A pattern your bent eyes
    May trace and follow
    To the shut bridal door.

    Lady, our love, our dear,
    Our bride most fair,
    They grew among the hollows
    Of the hills;
    As if the sea had spilled its blue,
    As if the sea had risen
    From its bed,
    And sinking to the level of the shore,
    Left hyacinths on the floor.

_There is a pause. Flute, pipe and wood-wind blend in a full, rich
movement. There is no definite melody but full, powerful rhythm like
soft but steady wind above forest trees. Into this, like rain, gradually
creeps the note of strings._

_As the strings grow stronger and finally dominate the whole, the
bride-chorus passes before the curtain. There may be any number in this
chorus. The figures -- tall young women, clothed in long white
tunics -- follow one another closely, yet are all distinct like a
procession of a temple frieze._

_The bride in the center is not at first distinguishable from her
maidens; but as they begin their song, the maidens draw apart into two
groups, leaving the veiled symbolic figure standing alone in the
center._

_The two groups range themselves to right and left like officiating
priestesses. The veiled figure stands with her back against the curtain,
the others being in profile. Her head is swathed in folds of diaphanous
white, through which the features are visible, like the veiled Tanagra._

_When the song is finished, the group to the bride's left turns about;
also the bride, so that all face in one direction. In processional form
they pass out, the figure of the bride again merging, not
distinguishable from the maidens._

_Strophe_

    But of her
    Who can say if she is fair?
    Bound with fillet,
    Bound with myrtle
    Underneath her flowing veil,
    Only the soft length
    (Beneath her dress)
    Of saffron shoe is bright
    As a great lily-heart
    In its white loveliness.

_Antistrophe_

    But of her
    We can say that she is fair.
    We bleached the fillet,
    Brought the myrtle;
    To us the task was set
    Of knotting the fine threads of silk:
    We fastened the veil,
    And over the white foot
    Drew on the painted shoe
    Steeped in Illyrian crocus.

_Strophe_

    But of her,
    Who can say if she is fair?
    For her head is covered over
    With her mantle
    White on white,
    Snow on whiter amaranth,
    Snow on hoar-frost,
    Snow on snow,
    Snow on whitest buds of myrrh.

_Antistrophe_

    But of her,
    We can say that she is fair;
    For we know underneath
    All the wanness,
    All the heat
    (In her blanched face)
    Of desire
    Is caught in her eyes as fire
    In the dark center leaf
    Of the white Syrian iris.

_The rather hard, hieratic precision of the music -- its stately pause and
beat -- is broken now into irregular lilt and rhythm of strings._

_Four tall young women, very young matrons, enter in a group. They stand
clear and fair, but this little group entirely lacks the austere
precision of the procession of maidens just preceding them. They pause
in the center of the stage; turn, one three-quarter, two in profile and
the fourth full face; they stand, turned as if confiding in each other
like a Tanagra group._

_They sing lightly, their flower trays under their arms._

    Along the yellow sand
    Above the rocks
    The laurel-bushes stand.
    Against the shimmering heat
    Each separate leaf
    Is bright and cold,
    And through the bronze
    Of shining bark and wood
    Run the fine threads of gold.

    Here in our wicker-trays,
    We bring the first faint blossoming
    Of fragrant bays:

    Lady, their blushes shine
    As faint in hue
    As when through petals
    Of a laurel-rose
    The sun shines through,
    And throws a purple shadow
    On a marble vase.

    (Ah, love,
    So her fair breasts will shine
    With the faint shadow above.)

_The harp chords become again more regular in simple definite rhythm.
The music is not so intense as the bride-chorus; and quieter, more
sedate, than the notes preceding the entrance of the last group._

_Five or six slightly older serene young women enter in processional
form; each holding before her, with precise bending of arms, coverlets
and linen, carefully folded, as if for the bride couch. The garments are
purple, scarlet and deep blue, with edge of gold._

_They sing to blending of wood-wind and harp._

    From citron-bower be her bed,
    Cut from branch of tree a-flower,
    Fashioned for her maidenhead.

    From Lydian apples, sweet of hue,
    Cut the width of board and lathe.
    Carve the feet from myrtle-wood.

    Let the palings of her bed
    Be quince and box-wood overlaid
    With the scented bark of yew.

    That all the wood in blossoming,
    May calm her heart and cool her blood
    For losing of her maidenhood.

_The wood-winds become more rich and resonant. A tall youth crosses the
stage as if seeking the bride door. The music becomes very rich, full of
color._

_The figure itself is a flame, an exaggerated symbol; the hair a flame;
the wings, deep red or purple, stand out against the curtains in a
contrasting or almost clashing shade of purple. The tunic, again a rich
purple or crimson, falls almost to the knees. The knees are bare; the
sandals elaborately strapped over and over. The curtain seems a rich
purple cloud, the figure, still brighter, like a flamboyant bird, half
emerged in the sunset._

_Love pauses just outside the bride's door with his gift, a tuft of
black-purple cyclamen. He sings to the accompaniment of wood-winds, in a
rich, resonant voice:_

    The crimson cover of her bed
    Is not so rich, nor so deeply bled
    The purple-fish that dyed it red,
    As when in a hot sheltered glen
    There flowered these stalks of cyclamen:

    (Purple with honey-points
    Of horns for petals;
    Sweet and dark and crisp,
    As fragrant as her maiden kiss.)

    There with his honey-seeking lips
    The bee clings close and warmly sips,
    And seeks with honey-thighs to sway
    And drink the very flower away.

    (Ah, stern the petals drawing back;
    Ah rare, ah virginal her breath!)

    Crimson, with honey-seeking lips,
    The sun lies hot across his back,
    The gold is decked across his wings.
    Quivering he sways and quivering clings
    (Ah, rare her shoulders drawing back!)
    One moment, then the plunderer slips
    Between the purple flower-lips.

_Love passes out with a crash of cymbals. There is a momentary pause and
the music falls into its calm, wave-like rhythm._

_A band of boys passes before the curtain. They pass from side to side,
crossing and re-crossing; but their figures never confuse one another,
the outlines are never blurred. They stand out against the curtain with
symbolic gesture, stooping as if to gather up the wreaths, or swaying
with long stiff branch as if to sweep the fallen petals from the
floor._

_There is no marked melody from the instruments, but the boys' voices,
humming lightly as they enter, gradually evolve a little dance song.
There are no words but the lilt up and down of the boys' tenor voices._

_Then, as if they had finished the task of gathering up the wreaths and
sweeping the petals, they stand in groups of two before the pillars
where the torches have been placed. They lift the torches from the
brackets. They hold them aloft between them, one torch to each two boys.
Their figures are cut against the curtain like the simple, triangular
design on the base of a vase or frieze -- the boys' heads on a level, the
torches above them._

_They sing in clear, half-subdued voices._

    Where love is king,
    Ah, there is little need
    To dance and sing,
    With bridal-torch to flare
    Amber and scatter light
    Across the purple air,
    To sing and dance
    To flute-note and to reed.

    Where love is come
    (Ah, love is come indeed!)
    Our limbs are numb
    Before his fiery need;
    With all their glad
    Rapture of speech unsaid,
    Before his fiery lips
    Our lips are mute and dumb.

    Ah, sound of reed,
    Ah, flute and trumpet wail,
    Ah, joy decreed -- 
    The fringes of her veil
    Are seared and white;
    Across the flare of light,
    Blinded the torches fail.
    (Ah, love is come indeed!)

_At the end of the song, the torches flicker out and the figures are no
longer distinguishable in the darkness. They pass out like shadows. The
purple curtain hangs black and heavy._

_The music dies away and is finally cut short with a few deep, muted
chords._




DEMETER




    Men, fires, feasts,
    steps of temple, fore-stone, lintel,
    step of white altar, fire and after-fire,
    slaughter before,
    fragment of burnt meat,
    deep mystery, grapple of mind to reach
    the tense thought,
    power and wealth, purpose and prayer alike,
    (men, fires, feasts, temple steps) -- useless.

    Useless to me who plant
    wide feet on a mighty plinth,
    useless to me who sit,
    wide of shoulder, great of thigh,
    heavy in gold, to press
    gold back against solid back
    of the marble seat:
    useless the dragons wrought on the arms,
    useless the poppy-buds and the gold inset
    of the spray of wheat.

    Ah they have wrought me heavy
    and great of limb -- 
    she is slender of waist,
    slight of breast, made of many fashions;
    they have set _her_ small feet
    on many a plinth;
    she they have known,
    she they have spoken with,
    she they have smiled upon,
    she they have caught
    and flattered with praise and gifts.

    But useless the flattery
    of the mighty power
    they have granted me:
    for I will not stay in her breast
    the great of limb,
    though perfect the shell they have
    fashioned me, these men!

    Do I sit in the market place -- 
    do I smile, does a noble brow
    bend like the brow of Zeus -- 
    am I a spouse, his or any,
    am I a woman, or goddess or queen,
    to be met by a god with a smile -- and left?




    Do you ask for a scroll,
    parchment, oracle, prophecy, precedent;
    do you ask for tablets marked with thought
    or words cut deep on the marble surface,
    do you seek measured utterance or the mystic trance?

    Sleep on the stones of Delphi -- 
    dare the ledges of Pallas
    but keep me foremost,
    keep me before you, after you, with you,
    never forget when you start
    for the Delphic precipice,
    never forget when you seek Pallas
    and meet in thought
    yourself drawn out from yourself
    like the holy serpent,
    never forget
    in thought or mysterious trance -- 
    I am greatest and least.

    Soft are the hands of Love,
    soft, soft are his feet;
    you who have twined myrtle,
    have you brought crocuses,
    white as the inner
    stript bark of the osier,
    have you set
    black crocus against the black
    locks of another?




    Of whom do I speak?

    Many the children of gods
    but first I take
    Bromios, fostering prince,
    lift from the ivy brake, a king.

    Enough of the lightning,
    enough of the tales that speak
    of the death of the mother:
    strange tales of a shelter
    brought to the unborn,
    enough of tale, myth, mystery, precedent -- 
    a child lay on the earth asleep.

    Soft are the hands of Love,
    but what soft hands
    clutched at the thorny ground,
    scratched like a small white ferret
    or foraging whippet or hound,
    sought nourishment and found
    only the crackling of ivy,
    dead ivy leaf and the white
    berry, food for a bird,
    no food for this who sought,
    bending small head in a fever,
    whining with little breath.

    Ah, small black head,
    ah, the purple ivy bush,
    ah, berries that shook and spilt
    on the form beneath,
    who begot you and left?

    Though I begot no man child
    all my days,
    the child of my heart and spirit,
    is the child the gods desert
    alike and the mother in death -- 
    the unclaimed Dionysios.



    _What of her -- 
    mistress of Death?_

    Form of a golden wreath
    were my hands that girt her head,
    fingers that strove to meet,
    and met where the whisps escaped
    from the fillet, of tenderest gold,
    small circlet and slim
    were my fingers then.

    Now they are wrought of iron
    to wrest from earth
    secrets; strong to protect,
    strong to keep back the winter
    when winter tracks too soon
    blanch the forest:
    strong to break dead things,
    the young tree, drained of sap,
    the old tree, ready to drop,
    to lift from the rotting bed
    of leaves, the old
    crumbling pine tree stock,
    to heap bole and knot of fir
    and pine and resinous oak,
    till fire shatter the dark
    and hope of spring
    rise in the hearts of men.

    _What of her -- 
    mistress of Death -- 
    what of his kiss?_

    Ah, strong were his arms to wrest
    slight limbs from the beautiful earth,
    young hands that plucked the first
    buds of the chill narcissus,
    soft fingers that broke
    and fastened the thorny stalk
    with the flower of wild acanthus.

    Ah, strong were the arms that took
    (ah evil, the heart and graceless,)
    but the kiss was less passionate!




SIMAETHA


    Drenched with purple,
    drenched with dye, my wool,
    bind you the wheel-spokes -- 
    turn, turn, turn my wheel!

    Drenched with purple,
    steeped in the red pulp
    of bursting sea-sloes -- 
    turn, turn, turn my wheel!

    (Ah did he think
    I did not know,
    I did not feel -- 
    what wrack, what weal for him:
    golden one, golden one,
    turn again Aphrodite with the yellow zone,
    I am cursed, cursed, undone!
    Ah and my face, Aphrodite,
    beside your gold,
    is cut out of white stone!)

    Laurel blossom and the red seed
    of the red vervain weed,
    burn, crackle in the fire,
    burn, crackle for my need!
    Laurel leaf, O fruited
    branch of bay,
    burn, burn away
    thought, memory and hurt!

    (Ah when he comes,
    stumbling across my sill,
    will he find me still,
    fragrant as the white privet,
    or as a bone,
    polished in wet and sun,
    worried of wild beaks,
    and of the whelps' teeth -- 
    worried of flesh,
    left to bleach under the sun,
    white as ash bled of heat,
    white as hail blazing in sheet-lightning,
    white as forked lightning
    rending the sleet?)




THETIS




    On the paved parapet
    you will step carefully
    from amber stones to onyx
    flecked with violet,
    mingled with light,
    half showing the sea-grass
    and sea-sand underneath,
    reflecting your white feet
    and the gay strap crimson
    as lily-buds of Arion,
    and the gold that binds your feet.




    You will pass
    beneath the island disk
    (and myrtle-wood,
    the carved support of it)
    and the white stretch
    of its white beach,
    curved as the moon crescent
    or ivory when some fine hand
    chisels it:
    when the sun slips
    through the far edge,
    there is rare amber
    through the sea,
    and flecks of it
    glitter on the dolphin's back
    and jewelled halter
    and harness and bit
    as he sways under it.




CIRCE


    It was easy enough
    to bend them to my wish,
    it was easy enough
    to alter them with a touch,
    but you
    adrift on the great sea,
    how shall I call you back?

    Cedar and white ash,
    rock-cedar and sand plants
    and tamarisk
    red cedar and white cedar
    and black cedar from the inmost forest,
    fragrance upon fragrance
    and all of my sea-magic is for nought.

    It was easy enough -- 
    a thought called them
    from the sharp edges of the earth;
    they prayed for a touch,
    they cried for the sight of my face,
    they entreated me
    till in pity
    I turned each to his own self.

    Panther and panther,
    then a black leopard
    follows close -- 
    black panther and red
    and a great hound,
    a god-like beast,
    cut the sand in a clear ring
    and shut me from the earth,
    and cover the sea-sound
    with their throats,
    and the sea-roar with their own barks
    and bellowing and snarls,
    and the sea-stars
    and the swirl of the sand,
    and the rock-tamarisk
    and the wind resonance -- 
    but not your voice.

    It is easy enough to call men
    from the edges of the earth.
    It is easy enough to summon them to my feet
    with a thought -- 
    it is beautiful to see the tall panther
    and the sleek deer-hounds
    circle in the dark.

    It is easy enough
    to make cedar and white ash fumes
    into palaces
    and to cover the sea-caves
    with ivory and onyx.

    But I would give up
    rock-fringes of coral
    and the inmost chamber
    of my island palace
    and my own gifts
    and the whole region
    of my power and magic
    for your glance.




LEDA


    Where the slow river
    meets the tide,
    a red swan lifts red wings
    and darker beak,
    and underneath the purple down
    of his soft breast
    uncurls his coral feet.

    Through the deep purple
    of the dying heat
    of sun and mist,
    the level ray of sun-beam
    has caressed
    the lily with dark breast,
    and flecked with richer gold
    its golden crest.

    Where the slow lifting
    of the tide,
    floats into the river
    and slowly drifts
    among the reeds,
    and lifts the yellow flags,
    he floats
    where tide and river meet.

    Ah kingly kiss -- 
    no more regret
    nor old deep memories
    to mar the bliss;
    where the low sedge is thick,
    the gold day-lily
    outspreads and rests
    beneath soft fluttering
    of red swan wings
    and the warm quivering
    of the red swan's breast.




HIPPOLYTUS TEMPORIZES


    I worship the greatest first -- 
    (it were sweet, the couch,
    the brighter ripple of cloth
    over the dipped fleece;
    the thought: her bones
    under the flesh are white
    as sand which along a beach
    covers but keeps the print
    of the crescent shapes beneath:
    I thought:
    between cloth and fleece,
    so her body lies.)

    I worship first, the great -- 
    (ah, sweet, your eyes -- 
    what God, invoked in Crete,
    gave them the gift to part
    as the Sidonian myrtle-flower
    suddenly, wide and swart,
    then swiftly,
    the eye-lids having provoked our hearts -- 
    as suddenly beat and close.)

    I worship the feet, flawless,
    that haunt the hills -- 
    (ah, sweet, dare I think,
    beneath fetter of golden clasp,
    of the rhythm, the fall and rise
    of yours, carven, slight
    beneath straps of gold that keep
    their slender beauty caught,
    like wings and bodies
    of trapped birds.)

    I worship the greatest first -- 
    (suddenly into my brain -- 
    the flash of sun on the snow,
    the fringe of light and the drift,
    the crest and the hill-shadow -- 
    ah, surely now I forget,
    ah splendour, my goddess turns:
    or was it the sudden heat,
    beneath quivering of molten flesh,
    of veins, purple as violets?)




CUCKOO SONG


    Ah, bird,
    our love is never spent
    with your clear note,
    nor satiate our soul;
    not song, not wail, not hurt,
    but just a call summons us
    with its simple top-note
    and soft fall;

    not to some rarer heaven
    of lilies over-tall,
    nor tuberose set against
    some sun-lit wall,
    but to a gracious
    cedar-palace hall;

    not marble set with purple
    hung with roses and tall
    sweet lilies -- such
    as the nightingale
    would summon for us
    with her wail -- 
    (surely only unhappiness
    could thrill
    such a rich madrigal!)
    not she, the nightingale
    can fill our souls
    with such a wistful joy as this:

    nor, bird, so sweet
    was ever a swallow note -- 
    not hers, so perfect
    with the wing of lazuli
    and bright breast -- 
    nor yet the oriole
    filling with melody
    from her fiery throat
    some island-orchard
    in a purple sea.

    Ah dear, ah gentle bird,
    you spread warm length
    of crimson wool
    and tinted woven stuff
    for us to rest upon,
    nor numb with ecstasy
    nor drown with death:

    only you soothe, make still
    the throbbing of our brain:
    so through her forest trees,
    when all her hope was gone
    and all her pain,
    Calypso heard your call -- 
    across the gathering drift
    of burning cedar-wood,
    across the low-set bed
    of wandering parsley and violet,
    when all her hope was dead.




THE ISLANDS




    What are the islands to me,
    what is Greece,
    what is Rhodes, Samos, Chios,
    what is Paros facing west,
    what is Crete?

    What is Samothrace,
    rising like a ship,
    what is Imbros rending the storm-waves
    with its breast?

    What is Naxos, Paros, Milos,
    what the circle about Lycia,
    what, the Cyclades'
    white necklace?

    What is Greece -- 
    Sparta, rising like a rock,
    Thebes, Athens,
    what is Corinth?

    What is Euboia
    with its island violets,
    what is Euboia, spread with grass,
    set with swift shoals,
    what is Crete?

    What are the islands to me,
    what is Greece?




    What can love of land give to me
    that you have not -- 
    what do the tall Spartans know,
    and gentler Attic folk?

    What has Sparta and her women
    more than this?

    What are the islands to me
    if you are lost -- 
    what is Naxos, Tinos, Andros,
    and Delos, the clasp
    of the white necklace?




    What can love of land give to me
    that you have not,
    what can love of strife break in me
    that you have not?

    Though Sparta enter Athens,
    Thebes wrack Sparta,
    each changes as water,
    salt, rising to wreak terror
    and fall back.




    What has love of land given to you
    that I have not?

    I have questioned Tyrians
    where they sat
    on the black ships,
    weighted with rich stuffs,
    I have asked the Greeks
    from the white ships,
    and Greeks from ships whose hulks
    lay on the wet sand, scarlet
    with great beaks.
    I have asked bright Tyrians
    and tall Greeks -- 
    what has love of land given you?
    And they answered -- peace.




    But beauty is set apart,
    beauty is cast by the sea,
    a barren rock,
    beauty is set about
    with wrecks of ships,
    upon our coast, death keeps
    the shallows -- death waits
    clutching toward us
    from the deeps.

    Beauty is set apart;
    the winds that slash its beach,
    swirl the coarse sand
    upward toward the rocks.

    Beauty is set apart
    from the islands
    and from Greece.




    In my garden
    the winds have beaten
    the ripe lilies;
    in my garden, the salt
    has wilted the first flakes
    of young narcissus,
    and the lesser hyacinth,
    and the salt has crept
    under the leaves of the white hyacinth.

    In my garden
    even the wind-flowers lie flat,
    broken by the wind at last.



    What are the islands to me
    if you are lost,
    what is Paros to me
    if your eyes draw back,
    what is Milos
    if you take fright of beauty,
    terrible, torturous, isolated,
    a barren rock?

    What is Rhodes, Crete,
    what is Paros facing west,
    what, white Imbros?

    What are the islands to me
    if you hesitate,
    what is Greece if you draw back
    from the terror
    and cold splendour of song
    and its bleak sacrifice?




AT BAIA


    I should have thought
    in a dream you would have brought
    some lovely, perilous thing,
    orchids piled in a great sheath,
    as who would say (in a dream)
    I send you this,
    who left the blue veins
    of your throat unkissed.

    Why was it that your hands
    (that never took mine)
    your hands that I could see
    drift over the orchid heads
    so carefully,
    your hands, so fragile, sure to lift
    so gently, the fragile flower stuff -- 
    ah, ah, how was it

    You never sent (in a dream)
    the very form, the very scent,
    not heavy, not sensuous,
    but perilous -- perilous -- 
    of orchids, piled in a great sheath,
    and folded underneath on a bright scroll
    some word:

    Flower sent to flower;
    for white hands, the lesser white,
    less lovely of flower leaf,

    or

    Lover to lover, no kiss,
    no touch, but forever and ever this.




SEA HEROES


    Crash on crash of the sea,
    straining to wreck men, sea-boards, continents,
    raging against the world, furious,
    stay at last, for against your fury
    and your mad fight,
    the line of heroes stands, god-like:

    Akroneos, Oknolos, Elatreus,
    helm-of-boat, loosener-of-helm, dweller-by-sea,
    Nauteus, sea-man,
    Prumneos, stern-of-ship,
    Agchialos, sea-girt,
    Elatreus, oar-shaft:
    lover-of-the-sea, lover-of-the-sea-ebb,
    lover-of-the-swift-sea,
    Ponteus, Proreus, Ooos:
    Anabesneos, one caught between
    wave-shock and wave-shock:
    Eurualos, broad sea-wrack,
    like Ares, man's death,
    and Naubolides, best in shape,
    of all first in size:
    Phaekous, seas' thunderbolt -- 
    ah, crash on crash of great names -- 
    man-tamer, man's-help, perfect Laodamos:
    and last the sons of great Alkinoos,
    Laodamos, Halios and god-like Clytomeos.

    Of all nations, of all cities,
    of all continents,
    she is favoured among the rest,
    for she gives men as great as the sea,
    valorous to the fight,
    to battle against the elements and evil:
    greater even than the sea,
    they live beyond wrack and death of cities,
    and each god-like name spoken
    is as a shrine in a godless place.

    But to name you,
    we reverent are breathless,
    weak with pain and old loss,
    and exile and despair -- 
    our hearts break but to speak
    your name, Oknaleos -- 
    and may we but call you in the feverish wrack
    of our storm-strewn beach, Eretmeos,
    and our hurt is quiet and our hearts tamed,
    as the sea may yet be tamed,
    and we vow to float great ships,
    named for each hero,
    and oar-blades, cut out of mountain-trees
    as such men might have shaped:
    Eretmeos and the sea is swept,
    baffled by the lordly shape,
    Akroneos has pines for his ship's keel;
    to love, to mate the sea?
    Ah there is Ponteos,
    the very deeps roar,
    hailing you dear -- 
    they clamour to Ponteos,
    and to Proeos
    leap, swift to kiss, to curl, to creep,
    lover to mistress.

    What wave, what love, what foam,
    for Ooos who moves swift as the sea?
    Ah stay, my heart, the weight
    of lovers, of loneliness
    drowns me,
    alas that their very names
    so press to break my heart
    with heart-sick weariness,
    what would they be,
    the very gods,
    rearing their mighty length
    beside the unharvested sea?




NOT HONEY


    Not honey,
    not the plunder of the bee
    from meadow or sand-flower
    or mountain bush;
    from winter-flower or shoot
    born of the later heat:
    not honey, not the sweet
    stain on the lips and teeth:
    not honey, not the deep
    plunge of soft belly
    and the clinging of the gold-edged
    pollen-dusted feet.

    Not so -- 
    though rapture blind my eyes,
    and hunger crisp
    dark and inert my mouth,
    not honey, not the south,
    not the tall stalk
    of red twin-lilies,
    nor light branch of fruit tree
    caught in flexible light branch.

    Not honey, not the south;
    ah flower of purple iris,
    flower of white,
    or of the iris, withering the grass -- 
    for fleck of the sun's fire,
    gathers such heat and power,
    that shadow-print is light,
    cast through the petals
    of the yellow iris flower.

    Not iris -- old desire -- old passion -- 
    old forgetfulness -- old pain -- 
    not this, nor any flower,
    but if you turn again,
    seek strength of arm and throat,
    touch as the god;
    neglect the lyre-note;
    knowing that you shall feel,
    about the frame,
    no trembling of the string
    but heat, more passionate
    of bone and the white shell
    and fiery tempered steel.




EVADNE


    I first tasted under Apollo's lips
    love and love sweetness,
    I Evadne;
    my hair is made of crisp violets
    or hyacinth which the wind combs back
    across some rock shelf;
    I Evadne
    was mate of the god of light.

    His hair was crisp to my mouth
    as the flower of the crocus,
    across my cheek,
    cool as the silver cress
    on Erotos bank;
    between my chin and throat
    his mouth slipped over and over.

    Still between my arm and shoulder,
    I feel the brush of his hair,
    and my hands keep the gold they took
    as they wandered over and over
    that great arm-full of yellow flowers.




SONG


    You are as gold
    as the half-ripe grain
    that merges to gold again,
    as white as the white rain
    that beats through
    the half-opened flowers
    of the great flower tufts
    thick on the black limbs
    of an Illyrian apple bough.

    Can honey distill such fragrance
    as your bright hair -- 
    for your face is as fair as rain,
    yet as rain that lies clear
    on white honey-comb,
    lends radiance to the white wax,
    so your hair on your brow
    casts light for a shadow.




WHY HAVE YOU SOUGHT


    Why have you sought the Greeks, Eros,
    when such delight was yours
    in the far depth of sky:
    there you could note bright ivory
    take colour where she bent her face,
    and watch fair gold shed gold
    on radiant surface of porch and pillar:
    and ivory and bright gold,
    polished and lustrous grow faint
    beside that wondrous flesh
    and print of her foot-hold:
    Love, why do you tempt the Grecian porticoes?

    Here men are bent with thought
    and women waste fair moments
    gathering lint and pricking coloured stuffs
    to mar their breasts,
    while she, adored,
    wastes not her fingers,
    worn of fire and sword,
    wastes not her touch
    on linen and fine thread,
    wastes not her head
    in thought and pondering,
    Love, why have you sought the horde
    of spearsmen, why the tent
    Achilles pitched beside the river-ford?




THE WHOLE WHITE WORLD


    The whole white world is ours,
    and the world, purple with rose-bays,
    bays, bush on bush,
    group, thicket, hedge and tree,
    dark islands in a sea
    of grey-green olive or wild white-olive,
    cut with the sudden cypress shafts,
    in clusters, two or three,
    or with one slender, single cypress-tree.

    Slid from the hill,
    as crumbling snow-peaks slide,
    citron on citron fill
    the valley, and delight
    waits till our spirits tire
    of forest, grove and bush
    and purple flower of the laurel-tree.

    Yet not one wearies,
    joined is each to each
    in happiness complete
    with bush and flower:
    ours is the wind-breath
    at the hot noon-hour,
    ours is the bee's soft belly
    and the blush of the rose-petal,
    lifted, of the flower.




PHAEDRA


    Think, O my soul,
    of the red sand of Crete;
    think of the earth; the heat
    burnt fissures like the great
    backs of the temple serpents;
    think of the world you knew;
    as the tide crept, the land
    burned with a lizard-blue
    where the dark sea met the sand.

    Think, O my soul -- 
    what power has struck you blind -- 
    is there no desert-root, no forest-berry
    pine-pitch or knot of fir
    known that can help the soul
    caught in a force, a power,
    passionless, not its own?

    So I scatter, so implore
    Gods of Crete, summoned before
    with slighter craft;
    ah, hear my prayer:

    Grant to my soul
    the body that it wore,
    trained to your thought,
    that kept and held your power,
    as the petal of black poppy,
    the opiate of the flower.

    For art undreamt in Crete,
    strange art and dire,
    in counter-charm prevents my charm
    limits my power:
    pine-cone I heap,
    grant answer to my prayer.

    No more, my soul -- 
    as the black cup, sullen and dark with fire,
    burns till beside it, noon's bright heat
    is withered, filled with dust -- 
    and into that noon-heat
    grown drab and stale,
    suddenly wind and thunder and swift rain,
    till the scarlet flower is wrecked
    in the slash of the white hail.

    The poppy that my heart was,
    formed to blind all mortals,
    made to strike and gather hearts
    like flame upon an altar,
    fades and shrinks, a red leaf
    drenched and torn in the cold rain.




SHE CONTRASTS WITH HERSELF HIPPOLYTA


    Can flame beget white steel -- 
    ah no, it could not take
    within my reins its shelter;
    steel must seek steel,
    or hate make out of joy
    a whet-stone for a sword;
    sword against flint,
    Theseus sought Hippolyta;
    she yielded not nor broke,
    sword upon stone,
    from the clash leapt a spark,
    Hippolytus, born of hate.

    What did she think
    when all her strength
    was twisted for his bearing;
    did it break,
    even within her sheltered heart, a song,
    some whispered note,
    distant and faint as this:

    _Love that I bear
    within my breast
    how is my armour melted
    how my heart:
    as an oak-tree
    that keeps beneath the snow,
    the young bark fresh
    till the spring cast
    from off its shoulders
    the white snow
    so does my armour melt._

    _Love that I bear
    within my heart, O speak;
    tell how beneath the serpent-spotted shell,
    the cygnets wait,
    how the soft owl
    opens and flicks with pride,
    eye-lids of great bird-eyes,
    when underneath its breast
    the owlets shrink and turn._

    You have the power,
    (then did she say) Artemis,
    benignity to grant
    forgiveness that I gave
    no quarter to an enemy who cast
    his armour on the forest-moss,
    and took, unmatched in an uneven contest,
    Hippolyta who relented not,
    returned and sought no kiss.

    Then did she pray: Artemis,
    grant that no flower
    be grafted alien on a broken stalk,
    no dark flame-laurel on the stricken crest
    of a wild mountain-poplar;
    grant in my thought,
    I never yield but wait,
    entreating cold white river,
    mountain-pool and salt:
    let all my veins be ice,
    until they break
    (strength of white beach,
    rock of mountain land,
    forever to you, Artemis, dedicate)
    from out my reins,
    those small, cold hands.




SHE REBUKES HIPPOLYTA


    Was she so chaste?

    Swift and a broken rock
    clatters across the steep shelf
    of the mountain slope,
    sudden and swift
    and breaks as it clatters down
    into the hollow breach
    of the dried water-course:
    far and away
    (through fire I see it,
    and smoke of the dead, withered stalks
    of the wild cistus-brush)
    Hippolyta, frail and wild,
    galloping up the slope
    between great boulder and rock
    and group and cluster of rock.

    Was she so chaste,
    (I see it, sharp, this vision,
    and each fleck on the horse's flanks
    of foam, and bridle and bit,
    silver, and the straps,
    wrought with their perfect art,
    and the sun,
    striking athwart the silver-work,
    and the neck, strained forward, ears alert,
    and the head of a girl
    flung back and her throat.)

    Was she so chaste -- 
    (Ah, burn my fire, I ask
    out of the smoke-ringed darkness
    enclosing the flaming disk
    of my vision)
    I ask for a voice to answer:
    was she chaste?

    Who can say -- 
    the broken ridge of the hills
    was the line of a lover's shoulder,
    his arm-turn, the path to the hills,
    the sudden leap and swift thunder
    of mountain boulders, his laugh.

    She was mad -- 
    as no priest, no lover's cult
    could grant madness;
    the wine that entered her throat
    with the touch of the mountain rocks
    was white, intoxicant:
    she, the chaste,
    was betrayed by the glint
    of light on the hills,
    the granite splinter of rocks,
    the touch of the stone
    where heat melts
    toward the shadow-side of the rocks.




EGYPT



    Egypt had cheated us,
    for Egypt took
    through guile and craft
    our treasure and our hope,
    Egypt had maimed us,
    offered dream for life,
    an opiate for a kiss,
    and death for both.

    White poison flower we loved
    and the black spike
    of an ungarnered bush -- 
    (a spice -- or without taste -- 
    we wondered -- then we asked
    others to take and sip
    and watched their death)
    Egypt we loved, though hate
    should have withheld our touch.

    Egypt had given us knowledge,
    and we took, blindly,
    through want of heart,
    what Egypt brought;
    knowing all poison,
    what was that or this,
    more or less perilous,
    than this or that.

    We pray you, Egypt,
    by what perverse fate,
    has poison brought with knowledge,
    given us this -- 
    not days of trance,
    shadow, fore-doom of death,
    but passionate grave thought,
    belief enhanced,
    ritual returned and magic;

    Even in the uttermost black pit
    of the forbidden knowledge,
    wisdom's glance,
    the grey eyes following
    in the mid-most desert -- 
    great shaft of rose,
    fire shed across our path,
    upon the face grown grey, a light,
    Hellas re-born from death.




HELIOS


    _Helios makes all things right: -- 
    night brands and chokes
    as if destruction broke
    over furze and stone and crop
    of myrtle-shoot and field-wort,
    destroyed with flakes of iron,
    the bracken-stems,
    where tender roots were sown,
    blight, chaff and waste
    of darkness to choke and drown._

    _A curious god to find,
    yet in the end faithful;
    bitter, the Kyprian's feet -- 
    ah flecks of whited clay,
    great hero, vaunted lord -- 
    ah petal, dust and wind-fall
    on the ground -- queen awaiting queen._

    _Better the weight, they tell,
    the helmet's beaten shell,
    Athene's riven steel,
    caught over the white skull,
    Athene sets to heal
    the few who merit it._

    _Yet even then, what help,
    should he not turn and note
    the height of forehead and the mark of conquest,
    draw near and try the helmet;
    to left -- reset the crown
    Athene weighted down,
    or break with a light touch
    mayhap the steel set to protect;
    to slay or heal._

    _A treacherous god, they say,
    yet who would wait to test
    justice or worth or right,
    when through a fetid night
    is wafted faint and nearer -- 
    then straight as point of steel
    to one who courts swift death,
    scent of Hesperidean orange-spray._




PRAYER


    White, O white face -- 
    from disenchanted days
    wither alike dark rose
    and fiery bays:
    no gift within our hands,
    nor strength to praise,
    only defeat and silence;
    though we lift hands, disenchanted,
    of small strength, nor raise
    branch of the laurel
    or the light of torch,
    but fold the garment
    on the riven locks,
    yet hear, all-merciful, and touch
    the fore-head, dim, unlit of pride and thought,
    Mistress -- be near!
    Give back the glamour to our will,
    the thought; give back the tool,
    the chisel; once we wrought
    things not unworthy,
    sandal and steel-clasp;
    silver and steel, the coat
    with white leaf-pattern
    at the arm and throat:
    silver and metal, hammered for the ridge
    of shield and helmet-rim;
    white silver with the dark hammered in,
    belt, staff and magic spear-shaft
    with the gilt spark at the point and hilt.


The Pier-Glass

THE STAKE


    Naseboro' held him guilty,
      Crowther took his part,
    Who lies at the cross-roads,
      A stake through his heart.

    Spring calls, and the stake answers
      Throwing out shoots;
    The towns debate what life is this
      Sprung from such roots.

    Naseboro' says "A Upas Tree";
      "A Rose," says Crowther;
    But April's here to declare it
      Neither one nor other.

    Neither ill nor very fair,
      Rose nor Upas,
    But an honest oak-tree,
      As its parent was.

    A green-tufted oak-tree
      On the green wold,
    Careless as the dead heart
      That the roots enfold.




THE TROLL'S NOSEGAY


    A simple nosegay! was that much to ask?
      (Winter still gloomed, with scarce a bud yet showing).
    He loved her ill, if he resigned the task.
      "Somewhere," she cried, "there must be blossom blowing."
    It seems my lady wept and the troll swore
      By Heaven he hated tears: he'd cure her spleen;
    Where she had begged one flower, he'd shower fourscore,
      A haystack bunch to amaze a China Queen.

    Cold fog-drawn Lily, pale mist-magic Rose
      He conjured, and in a glassy cauldron set
      With elvish unsubstantial Mignonette
    And such vague bloom as wandering dreams enclose.
      But she?
          Awed,
              Charmed to tears,
                            Distracted,
                                      Yet -- 
    Even yet, perhaps, a trifle piqued -- who knows?




THE PIER-GLASS

    Lost manor where I walk continually
    A ghost, while yet in woman's flesh and blood.
    Up your broad stairs mounting with outspread fingers
    And gliding steadfast down your corridors
    I come by nightly custom to this room,
    And even on sultry afternoons I come
    Drawn by a thread of time-sunk memory.

    Empty, unless for a huge bed of state
    Shrouded with rusty curtains drooped awry
    (A puppet theatre where malignant fancy
    Peoples the wings with fear). At my right hand
    A ravelled bell-pull hangs in readiness
    To summon me from attic glooms above
    Service of elder ghosts; here at my left
    A sullen pier-glass cracked from side to side
    Scorns to present the face as do new mirrors
    With a lying flush, but shows it melancholy
    And pale, as faces grow that look in mirrors.

    Is here no life, nothing but the thin shadow
    And blank foreboding, never a wainscote rat
    Rasping a crust? Or at the window pane
    No fly, no bluebottle, no starveling spider?
    The windows frame a prospect of cold skies
    Half-merged with sea, as at the first creation,
    Abstract, confusing welter. Face about,
    Peer rather in the glass once more, take note
    Of self, the grey lips and long hair dishevelled,
    Sleep-staring eyes. Ah, mirror, for Christ's love
    Give me one token that there still abides
    Remote, beyond this island mystery
    So be it only this side Hope, somewhere,
    In streams, on sun-warm mountain pasturage,
    True life, natural breath; not this phantasma.

    A rumour, scarcely yet to be reckoned sound,
    But a pulse quicker or slower, then I know
    My plea is granted; death prevails not yet.
    For bees have swarmed behind in a close place
    Pent up between this glass and the outer wall.
    The combs are founded, the queen rules her court,
    Bee-serjeants posted at the entrance chink
    Are sampling each returning honey-cargo
    With scrutinizing mouth and commentary,
    Slow approbation, quick dissatisfaction.
    Disquieting rhythm, that leads me home at last
    From labyrinthine wandering. This new mood
    Of judgment orders me my present duty,
    To face again a problem strongly solved
    In life gone by, but now again proposed
    Out of due time for fresh deliberation.
    Did not my answer please the Master's ear?
    Yet, I'll stay obstinate. How went the question,
    A paltry question set on the elements
    Of love and the wronged lover's obligation?
    _Kill or forgive?_ Still does the bed ooze blood?
    Let it drip down till every floor-plank rot!
    Yet shall I answer, challenging the judgment: -- 
    "_Kill, strike the blow again, spite what shall come._"
    "Kill, strike, again, again," the bees in chorus hum.




THE FINDING OF LOVE


    Before this generous time
    Of Love in morning prime,
    He had long season stood
    Bound in a nightmare mood
    Of dense murk, rarely lit
    By Jack-o'-Lanthorn's flit
    And straightway smothered spark
    Of beasts' eyes in the dark,
    Mourning with sense adrift,
    Tears rolling swift.
    With o, for Sun to blaze
    Drying the cobweb-maze
    Dew-sagged upon the corn,
    With o, for flowering thorn,
    For fly and butterfly,
    For pigeons in the sky,
    For robin and thrush,
    For the long bulrush,
    For cherry under the leaf,
    For an end to grief,
    For joy in steadfastness.
    Then through his distress
    And clouded vision came
    An unknown gradual flame
    By silent hands controlled,
    Pale at first and cold,
    Like wizard's lily-bloom
    Conjured from the gloom,
    Like torch of glow-worm seen
    Through grasses shining green
    By children half in fright,
    Or Christmas candlelight
    Flung on the outer snow,
    Or tinsel stars that show
    Their evening glory
    With sheen of fairy story.

    No more, no more,
    Forget that went before!
    Not a wrack remains
    Of all his former pains.
    Here's Love a drench of light,
    A Sun dazzling the sight,
    Well started on his race
    Towards the Zenith space
    Where fixed and sure
    He shall endure,
    Holding peace secure.

    Now with his blaze
    He dries the cobweb maze
    Dew-sagging on the corn,
    He brings the flowering thorn,
    The fly and butterfly,
    And pigeons in the sky,
    The robin and the thrush,
    And the long bulrush,
    And cherry under the leaf,
    Earth in a silken dress,
    With end to grief,
    With love in steadfastness.




REPROACH


    Your grieving moonlight face looks down
      Through the forest of my fears,
    Crowned with a spiny bramble-crown,
      Dew-dropped with evening tears.

    Why do you spell "untrue, unkind,"
      Reproachful eyes plaguing my sleep?
    I am not guilty in my mind
      Of aught would make you weep.

    Untrue? but how, what broken oath?
      Unkind? I know not even your name.
    Unkind, untrue, you charge me both,
      Scalding my heart with shame.

    The black trees shudder, dropping snow,
      The stars tumble and spin.
    Speak, speak, or how may a child know
      His ancestral sin?




THE MAGICAL PICTURE


    Glinting on the roadway
    A broken mirror lay:
    Then what did the child say
      Who found it there?
    He cried there was a goblin
    Looking out as he looked in -- 
    Wild eyes and speckled skin,
      Black, bristling hair!

    He brought it to his father
    Who being a simple sailor
    Swore, "This is a true wonder,
      Deny it who can!
    Plain enough to me, for one,
    It's a portrait aptly done
    Of Admiral, the great Lord Nelson
      When a young man."

    The sailor's wife perceiving
    Her husband had some pretty thing
    At which he was peering,
      Seized it from his hand.
    Then tears started and ran free,
    "Jack, you have deceived me,
    I love you no more," said she,
      "So understand!"

    "But, Mary," says the sailor,
    "This is a famous treasure,
    Admiral Nelson's picture
      Taken in youth."
    "Viper and fox," she cries,
    "To trick me with such lies,
    Who is this wench with the bold eyes?
      Tell the full truth!"

    Up rides the parish priest
    Mounted on a fat beast.
    Grief and anger have not ceased
      Between those two;
    Little Tom still weeps for fear;
    He has seen Hobgoblin, near,
    Great white teeth and foul leer
      That pierced him through.

    Now the old priest lifts his glove
    Bidding all for God's love
    To stand and not to move,
      Lest blood be shed.
    "O, O!" cries the urchin,
    "I saw the devil grin,
    He glared out, as I looked in;
      A true death's head!"

    Mary weeps, "Ah, Father,
    My Jack loves another!
    On some voyage he courted her
      In a land afar."
    This, with cursing, Jack denies: -- 
    "Father, use your own eyes:
    It is Lord Nelson in disguise
      As a young tar."

    When the priest took the glass,
    Fresh marvels came to pass
    "A saint of glory, by the Mass!
      "Where got you this?"
    He signed him with the good Sign,
    Be sure the relic was divine,
    He would fix it in a shrine
      For pilgrims to kiss.

    There the chapel folk who come
    (Honest, some, and lewd, some),
    See the saint's eyes and are dumb,
      Kneeling on the flags.
    Some see the Doubter Thomas,
    And some Nathaniel in the glass,
    And others whom but old Saint Judas
      With his money bags?




DISTANT SMOKE


    Seth and the sons of Seth who followed him
    Halted in silence: labour, then, was vain.
    Fast at the zenith, blazoned in his splendour,
    Hung the fierce Sun, wherefore these travelling folk
    Stood centred each in his own disc of shade.
    The term proposed was ended; now to enjoy
    The moment's melancholy; their tears fell shining.

    Yesterday early at the dreadful hour,
    When life ebbs lowest, when the strand of being
    Is slowly bared until discovered show
    Weed-mantelled hulks that foundered years ago
    At autumn anchorage, then father Adam
    Summoned in haste his elder generations
    To his death-tent, and gasping spoke to them,
    Forthwith defining an immediate journey
    Beyond the eastern ridge, in quest for one
    Whom he named Cain, brother to Seth, true uncle
    To these young spearmen; they should lead him here
    For a last benediction at his hands.

    First-born yet outlawed! Scarcely they believed
    In this strange word of "Cain," in this new man,
    Man, yet outside the tents; but Adam swore
    And gave them a fair sign of recognition.
    There was a brand, he said, a firm red pillar
    Parting Cain's brows, and Cain had mighty hands,
    Sprouting luxurious hair, red, like his beard.
    Moreover Adam said that by huge strength
    Himself could stay this ebb of early morning,
    Yet three days longer, three days, though no more -- 
    This for the stern desire and long disquietude
    That was his love for Cain; whom God had cursed.
    Then would he kiss all fatherly and so die -- 
    Kneeling, with eyes abased, they made him promise,
    Swore, at the midpoint of their second day,
    If unsped in the search of whom he named,
    They would come hasting home to Adam's tent.
    They touched his bony fingers; forth they went.

    Now Seth, shielding his eyes, sees mistily
    Breaking the horizon thirty miles away
    (A full day's journey) what but a wisp, a feather,
    A thin line, half a nothing -- distant smoke!
    Blown smoke, a signal from that utmost ridge
    Of desolation -- the camp fire of Cain.
    He to restrain his twelve impetuous sons
    (He knows the razor-edge of their young spirit)
    Dissembles seeing, turns his steps about,
    Bids them come follow, but they little heeding,
    Scarce noting his commands, fasten their eyes
    On smoke, so forfeit Adam's benediction,
    Striding forward into the wilderness
    With eager thighs, forgetful of their oath,
    Adventurous for this monster, a new man,
    Their own kin -- how accursed? -- they haste for
    wonder.




MORNING PHOENIX


    In my body lives a flame,
      Flame that burns me all the day,
    When a fierce sun does the same,
      I am charred away.

    Who could keep a smiling wit,
      Roasted so in heart and hide,
    Turning on the sun's red spit,
      Scorched by love inside?

    Caves I long for and cold rocks,
      Minnow-peopled country brooks,
    Blundering gales of Equinox,
      Sunless valley-nooks.

    Daily so I might restore
      Calcined heart and shrivelled skin,
    A morning phoenix with proud roar
      Kindled new within.




CATHERINE DRURY


    _Mother_

    Edward will not taste his food,
        Nor touch his drink,
    Flings me answers gruff and rude:
        Why, I dare not think.


    _Sister_

    Mother, do not try to know
    All that moves in Edward's heart,
    The fiery gloom he will not show;
    You and he who lay so near
        Fall wide apart.
    Watch your rival, mother dear:
    Catherine Drury does not guess
    His dark love or your envious fear,
        Her own loveliness.
    She will laugh, she will play,
    Never know the hurt she does:
    Edward's heart will melt away,
        His head go buzz,
    And if he thinks you read his mind,
    Better you had been struck stone blind.




RAISING THE STONE


    A shaft of moon from the cloud-hurried sky,
      Has coursed the wide dark heath, but nowhere found
    One paler patch to illumine -- oats nor rye,
      Chalk-pit nor waterpool nor sandy ground -- 
    Till, checked by our thronged faces on the mound
      (A wedge of whiteness) universally
    Strained backward from the task that holds us bound,
      It beams on set jaw and hate-maddened eye.

    The vast stone lifts, turns, topples, in its fall
      Spreads death: but we who live raise a shrill chant
    Of joy for sacrifice cleansing us all.
      Once more we heave. Erect in earth we plant,
    The interpreter of our dumb furious call,
      Outraging Heaven, pointing
                "I want, I want."




THE TREASURE BOX


    Ann in chill moonlight unlocks
    Her polished brassbound treasure-box,
    Draws a soft breath, prepares to spread
    The toys around her on the bed.
    She dips for luck: by luck pulls out
    A silver pig with ring in snout,
    The sort that Christmas puddings yield;
    Next comes a painted nursery shield
    Boy-carved; and then two yellow gloves,
    A Limerick wonder that Ann loves,
    Leather so thin and joined so well
    The pair fold in a walnut shell;
    Here's patchwork that her sister made
    With antique silk and flower brocade,
    Small faded scraps in memory rich
    Joined each to each with feather-stitch;
    Here's cherry and forget-me-not
    Ribbon bunched in a great knot;
    A satin purse with pansies on it;
    A Tudor baby's christening bonnet;
    Old Mechlin lace minutely knit
    (Some woman's eyes went blind for it);
    And Spanish broideries that pinch
    Three blossomed rosetrees to one inch;
    Here are Ann's brooches, simple pins,
    A Comet brooch, two Harlequins,
    A Posy; here's a great resplendent
    Dove-in-bush Italian pendant;
    A Chelsea gift-bird; a toy whistle;
    A halfpenny stamped with the Scots thistle;
    A Breguet watch; a coral string;
    Her mother's thin-worn wedding ring;
    A straw box full of hard smooth sweets;
    A book, the _Poems of John Keats_;
    A chessman; a pink paper rose;
    A diary dwindling to its close
    Nine months ago; a worsted ball;
    A patchbox; a stray match -- that's all,
    All but a few small treasured scraps
    Of paper; things forbid perhaps -- 
    See how slowly Ann unties
    The packet where her heartache lies;
    Watch her lips move; she slants a letter
    Up towards the moon to read it better,
    (The moon may master what he can).
    R stands for Richard, A for Ann
    And L ... at this the old moon blinks
    And softly from the window shrinks.




THE KISS


    Are you shaken, are you stirred
      By a whisper of love,
    Spellbound to a word
      Does Time cease to move,
    Till her calm grey eye
      Expands to a sky
    And the clouds of her hair
      Like storms go by?

    Then the lips that you have kissed
      Turn to frost and fire,
    And a white-steaming mist
      Obscures desire:
    So back to their birth
      Fade water, air, earth,
    And the First Power moves
      Over void and dearth.

    Is that Love? no, but Death,
      A passion, a shout,
    The deep in-breath,
      The breath roaring out,
    And once that is flown,
      You must lie alone,
    Without hope, without life,
      Poor flesh, sad bone.




LOST LOVE


    His eyes are quickened so with grief,
    He can watch a grass or leaf
    Every instant grow; he can
    Clearly through a flint wall see,
    Or watch the startled spirit flee
    From the throat of a dead man.
      Across two counties he can hear,
    And catch your words before you speak.
    The woodlouse or the maggot's weak
    Clamour rings in his sad ear;
    And noise so slight it would surpass
    Credence: -- drinking sound of grass,
    Worm talk, clashing jaws of moth
    Chumbling holes in cloth:
    The groan of ants who undertake
    Gigantic loads for honour's sake,
    Their sinews creak, their breath comes thin:
    Whir of spiders when they spin,
    And minute whispering, mumbling, sighs
    Of idle grubs and flies.
      This man is quickened so with grief,
    He wanders god-like or like thief
    Inside and out, below, above,
    Without relief seeking lost love.




FOX'S DINGLE


    Take now a country mood,
      Resolve, distil it: -- 
    Nine Acre swaying alive,
      June flowers that fill it,

    Spicy sweet-briar bush,
      The uneasy wren
    Fluttering from ash to birch
      And back again,

    Milkwort on its low stem,
      Spread hawthorn tree,
    Sunlight patching the wood,
      A hive-bound bee....

    Girls riding nim-nim-nim,
      Ladies, trot-trot,
    Gentlemen hard at gallop,
      Shouting, steam-hot.

    Now over the rough turf
      Bridles go jingle,
    And there's a well loved pool,
      By Fox's Dingle,

    Where Sweetheart, my brown mare,
      Old Glory's daughter,
    May loll her leathern tongue
      In snow-cool water.




THE GNAT


    The shepherd Watkin heard an inner voice
    Calling "My creature, ho! be warned, be ready!"
    Calling, "The moment comes, therefore be ready!"
    And a third time calling, "Creature, be ready!"

    This old poor man mistook the call, which sounded
    Not for himself, but for his pensioner.
    Now (truth or phantasy) the shepherd nourished
    Fast in his brain, due earnings of transgression,
    A creature like to that avenging fly
    Once crept unseen in at King Herod's ear,
    Tunnelling gradually inwards, upwards,
    Heading for flowery pastures of the brain,
    And battened on such grand, presumptuous fare
    As grew him brazen claws and brazen hair
    And wings of iron mail. Old Watkin felt
    A like intruder channelling to and fro.
    He cursed his day and sin done in past years,
    Repentance choked, pride that outlawed his heart,
    So that at night often in thunderous weather
    Racked with the pain he'd start
    From sleep, incontinently howling, leaping,
    Striking his hoar head on the cottage walls,
    Stamping his feet, dragging his hair by the roots.
    He'd rouse the Gnat to anger, send it buzzing
    Like a huge mill, scraping with metal claws
    At his midpoint of being; forthwith tumble
    With a great cry for Death to stoop and end him.

    Now Watkin hears the voice and weeps for bliss,
    The voice that warned "Creature, the time is come."
    Merciful Death, was it Death, all his desire?
    Promised of Heaven, and speedy? O Death, come!

    Only for one thought must he make provision,
    For honest Prinny, for old bob-tail Prinny.
    Another master? Where? These hillside crofters
    Were spiteful to their beasts and mercenary.
    Prinny to such? No, Prinny too must die.
    By his own hand, then? Murder! By what other?
    No human hand should touch the sacrifice,
    No human hand;
    God's hand then, through his temporal minister.

    Three times has Watkin in the morning early
    When not a soul was rising, left his flock,
    Come to the Minister's house through the cold mist,
    Clicked at the latch and slowly moved the gate,
    Faltered, held back and dared not enter in.
    "Not this time, Prinny, we'll not rouse them yet,
    To-morrow, surely, for our death is tokened,
    My death and your death with small interval.
    We meet in fields beyond; be sure of it, Prinny!"

    On the next night
    The busy Gnat, swollen to giant size,
    Pent-up within the skull, knew certainly,
    As a bird knows in the egg, his hour was come.
    The thrice repeated call had given him summons ...
      He must out, crack the shell, out, out!
    He strains, claps his wings, arches his back,
    Drives in his talons, out! out!

    In the white anguish of this travail, Watkin
    Hurls off his blankets, tears an axe from the nail
    Batters the bed, hews table, splits the floor,
    Hears Prinny whine at his feet, leaps, strikes again,
    Strikes, yammering.
                    At that instant with a clatter
    Noise of a bursting dam, a toppling wall,
    Out flies the new-born creature from his mouth
    And humming fearsomely like a huge engine,
    Rackets about the room, smites the unseen
    Glass of half-open windows, reels, recovers,
    Soars out into the meadows, and is gone.

    Silence prolonged to an age. Watkin still lives?
    The hour of travail by the voice foretold
    Brought no last throbbings of the dying Body
    In child-birth of the Soul. Watkin still lives.

    Labourer Watkin delves in the wet fields.
    Did an old shepherd die that night with Prinny,
    Die weeping with his head on the outraged corpse?
    Oh, he's forgotten. A dead dream, a cloud.
    Labourer Watkin delves, drowsily, numbly,
    His harsh spade grates among the buried stones.




THE PATCHWORK BONNET


    Across the room my silent love I throw,
      Where you sit sewing in bed by candlelight,
        Your young stern profile and industrious fingers
    Displayed against the blind in a shadow show,
      To Dinda's grave delight.

    The needle dips and pokes, the cheerful thread
      Runs after, follow-my-leader down the seam:
        The patchwork pieces cry for joy together,
    O soon to sit as a crown on Dinda's head,
      Fulfilment of their dream.

    Snippets and odd ends folded by, forgotten,
      With camphor on a top shelf, hard to find,
        Now wake to this most happy resurrection,
    To Dinda playing toss with a reel of cotton
      And staring at the blind.

    Dinda in sing-song stretching out one hand
      Calls for the playthings; mother does not hear:
        Her mind sails far away on a patchwork Ocean,
    And all the world must wait till she touches land,
      So Dinda cries in fear,

    Then Mother turns, laughing like a young fairy,
      And Dinda smiles to see her look so kind,
        Calls out again for playthings, playthings, playthings,
    And now the shadows make an Umbrian "_Mary
      Adoring_," on the blind.




KIT LOGAN AND LADY HELEN


    Here is Kit Logan with her love-child come
        To Lady Helen's gate:
    Then down sweeps Helen from the Italian room,
        She, with her child of hate.

    Kit's boy was born of violent hot desire,
        Helen's of hate and dread:
    Poor girl, betrayed to union with the Squire,
        Loathing her marriage bed.

    _Kit Logan, who is father to your boy?_
        But Helen knows, too well:
    Listen what biting taunts they both employ,
        Watch their red anger swell.

    Yet each would give her undying soul to be
        Changed to the other's place.
    Kit from the wet road's tasking cruelty
        Looks up to silk and lace,

    Helen looks down at rags, her fluttering pride
        Caught in this cage of glass,
    Eager to trudge, thieve, beg by the road-side,
        Or starving to eat grass ...

    Silence. Wrath dies. For Woman's old good name
        Each swears a sister's oath;
    Weeping, they kiss; to the Squire's lasting shame,
        Who broke the heart in both.




DOWN


    Downstairs a clock had chimed, two o'clock only.
    Then outside from the hen-roost crowing came.
    But why should Shift-wing call against the clock,
    Three hours from dawn? The shutters click and knock,
    And he remembers a sad superstition
    Unfitting for the sick-bed -- Turn aside,
    Distract, divide, ponder the simple tales
    That puzzled childhood; riddles, turn them over,
    Half-riddles, answerless, the more intense! -- 
    Lost bars of music tinkling with no sense
    Recur, drowning uneasy superstition.

    Mouth open, he was lying, this sick man,
    And sinking all the while; how had he come
    To sink? On better nights his dream went flying,
    Dipping, sailing the pasture of his sleep,
    But now, since clock and cock, had sunk him down
    Through mattress, bed, floor, floors beneath, stairs, cellars,
    Through deep foundations of the manse; still sinking
    Through unturned earth. How had he cheated space
    With inadvertent motion or word uttered
    Of too-close-packed intelligence (such there are)
    That he should penetrate with sliding ease,
    Dense earth, compound of ages, granite ribs
    And groins? Consider, there was some word uttered,
    Some abracadabra -- then like a stage-ghost,
    Funereally with weeping, down, drowned, lost!

    Oh, to be a child once more, sprawling at ease,
    On warm turf of a ruined castle court.
    Once he had dropped a stone between flat slabs
    That mask the ancient well, mysteriously
    Plunging his mind down with it. Hear it go
    Rattling and rocketing down in secret void.
    Count slowly one, two, three! and echoes rise
    Fainter and fainter, merged in the gradual hum
    Of bees and flies; only a thin draught rises
    To chill the drowsy air; he for a while
    Lay without spirit; until that floated back
    From the deep waters. Oh, to renew now
    The bliss of repossession, kindly sun
    Forfeit for ever, and the scent of thyme!

    Falling, falling! Light closed up behind him,
    Now stunned by the violent subterrene flow
    Of rivers, whirling down to hiss below
    On the flame-axis of this terrible world;
    Toppling upon their water-fall, O spirit ...




SAUL OF TARSUS


    "Share and share alike
      In the nest" was the rule,
    But Paul had a wide throat,
      He loved his belly-full.

    Over the edge went Peter,
      After him went John,
    True-blooded young nestlings
      Thrown out, one by one.

    If Mother Church was proud
      Of her great cuckoo son,
    He bit off her simple head
      Before he had done.




STORM: AT THE FARM WINDOW


    The unruly member (for relief
      Of aching head) clacks without care;
    Pastures lie sullen; hung with grief
      The steading: thunder binds the air.

    Gulls on the blue sea-surface rock:
      The cows move lowing to scant shade;
    Jess lays aside the half-worked smock,
      Dan, in his ditch, lets fall the spade.

           *       *       *       *       *

    Now swoops the outrageous hurricane
    With lightning in steep pitchfork jags;
    The blanched hill leaps in sheeted rain,
      Sea masses white to assault the crags.

    Such menace tottering overhead,
      Old Jess for ague scolds no more;
    She sees grey bobtail flung down dead
      Lightning-blazed by the barn door -- 

    Wonder and panic chase our grief,
    Purge our thick distempered blood;
    Man, cattle, harvest shock and sheaf,
      Stagger below the sluicing flood....




BLACK HORSE LANE


    Dame Jane the music mistress,
              the music mistress;
    Sharkie the baker of Black Horse Lane,
          At sound of a fiddle
          Caught her up by the middle -- 
    And away like swallows from the lane,
          Flying out together -- 
          From the crooked lane.

    What words said Sharkie to her,
              said Sharkie to her?
    How did she look in the lane?
          No neighbour heard
          One sigh or one word,
    Not a sound but the fiddling in Black Horse Lane,
          The happy noise of music -- 
          Again and again.

    Where now be those two old 'uns,
              be those two old 'uns,
    Sharkie the baker run off with Jane?
          Hark ye up to Flint Street,
          Halloo to Pepper-Mint Street,
    Follow by the fells to the great North Plain,
          By the fells and the river -- 
          To the cold North Plain.

    How came this passion to them,
              this passion to them,
    Love in a freshet on Black Horse Lane?
          It came without warning
          One blue windy morning
    So they scarcely might know was it joy or pain,
          With scarce breath to wonder -- 
          Was it joy or pain.

    Took they no fardels with them,
              no fardels with them,
    Out and alone on the ice-bound plain?
          Sharkie he had rockets
          And crackers in his pockets,
    Ay, and she had a plaid shawl to keep off the rain,
    An old Highland plaid shawl -- 
          To keep off the rain.




RETURN


    The seven years' curse is ended now
    That drove me forth from this kind land,
    From mulberry-bough and apple bough
    And gummy twigs the west-wind shakes,
    To drink the brine from crusted lakes
    And grit my teeth on sand.

    The load that from my shoulder slips
    Straightway upon your own is tied,
    You, too, shall scorch your finger-tips,
    With scrabbling on the desert's face
    Such thoughts I had for this green place,
    Sent scapegoat for your pride.

    Now for your cold, malicious brain
    And most uncharitable, cold heart,
    You, too, shall clank the seven years' chain
    On sterile ground for all time curst
    With famine's itch and flames of thirst,
    The blank sky's counterpart.

    Here, Robin on a tussock sits,
    And Cuckoo with his call of hope
    Cuckoos awhile, then off he flits,
    While peals of dingle-dongle keep
    Troop discipline among the sheep
    That graze across the slope.

    A brook from fields of gentle sun,
    Through the glade his water heaves,
    The falling cone would well-nigh stun
    That squirrel wantonly lets drop,
    When up he scampers to tree-top,
    And dives among the green.

    Yet, no, I ask a wider peace
    Than peace your heart could comprehend,
    More ample than my own release;
    Go, be you loosed from your right fate,
    Go with forgiveness and no hate;
    Here let the story end.




INCUBUS


    Asleep, amazed, with lolling head,
    Arms in supplication spread,
    Body shudders, dumb with fear;
    There lifts the Moon, but who am I,
    Cloaked in shadow wavering by,
    Stooping, muttering at his ear?
    Bound is Body, foot and hand,
    Bound to lie at my command,
    Horror bolted to lie still
    While I sap what sense I will.

    Through the darkness here come I,
    Softly fold about the prey;
    Body moaning must obey,
    Must not question who or why,
    Must accept me, come what may,
    Dumbly must obey.

    When owls and cocks dispute the dawn,
    Through the window I am drawn
    Streaming out, a foggy breath.
    ... Body wakens with a sigh
    From the spell that was half Death,
    Smiles for freedom, blinks an eye
    At the sun-commanded sky,
    "O morning scent and treetop song,
    Slow-rising smoke and nothing wrong!"




THE HILLS OF MAY


    Walking with a virgin heart
      The green hills of May,
    Me, the Wind, she took as lover
      By her side to play.

    Let me toss her untied hair,
      Let me shake her gown,
    Careless though the daisies redden,
      Though the Sun frown.

    Scorning in her gay courage
      Lesser love than this,
    My cool spiritual embracing,
      My gentle kiss.

    So she walked, the proud lady,
      So danced or ran,
    So she loved with a calm heart,
      Neglecting man....

    Fade, fail, innocent stars
      On the green of May;
    She has left our bournes for ever,
      Too fine to stay.




THE CORONATION MURDER

In Four Parts


    _Blessed above all women
    Shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be._
    Jael, a queen in Heaven
    Surely will speak out straight in defence of me.

    Shall I despair Salvation?
    Was Sisera then more ripe for the knife or nail
    Than rat-soul'd Becker? Do I misread the tale?

    I was no stealthy serpent.
    (Jael flattered and killed her man as he slept.)
    I was a lion, I challenged before I leapt.

    Three times I gave clear warning
    (Fair-play's good sport), then standing I struck him dead.
    Ram-faced lecher, the blood on his own beast head!

    _Blessed above all women
    Shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be._
    Ah, she won fame for her triumph,
    My inward joy was payment enough for me.



    Old Becker crawling in the night
      From his grave at the stair-foot,
    Labours up the long flight,
      Feeble, dribbling, black as soot,
    Quakes at his own ghostly fright.

    A cat goes past with lantern eyes
      Shooting splendour through the dark.
    Murder! Help! a voice cries
      In nightmare; the son dreams that stark
    In lead his vanished father lies.

    A stair-top glimmer points the goal.
      Becker goes wavering up, tongue-tied,
    Stoops, with eye to keyhole....
      There, a tall candle by her side,
    Delilah sits, serene and whole.

    Her fingers turn the prayer-book leaves,
      Her forehead hints no mental strife:
    Soft and calm her breast heaves:
      _So calmly, with his cobbling knife
    She stabbed him through_ ... now never grieves.

    Baffled, aghast with hate, mouse-poor,
      He glares and clatters the brass knob ...
    _Through his heart it slid sure:
      He bowed, he died with never a sob,
    Again she stabbed_, now sits secure.

    Praying as she has always prayed
      For great Victoria's Majesty,
    Droning prayer for God's aid
      To succour long dead Royalty,
    The Consort Prince, Queen Adelaide....

    She falls asleep, the clocks chime two;
      Old Becker sinks to unquiet rest.
    Loud and sad the cats mew:
      Lead weighs cruelly on his breast:
    His bones are tufted with mildew.


    What's that, who's that comes breaking on my sleep
      With groans? What, father, you? (The very look,
    The same smudged foolish face like an old sheep
      Even after twenty years scarcely mistook.)

    Speak, Father, speak; that night what came to you
      Vanished in wrath or terror? Tell the tale;
    Your beer left still in mug, your half-made shoe
      On last, your turnip ticking on its nail!

    _"Son, it was Death. I have not stirred a foot
      Out of this horrible dwelling all these years,
    But planted like a kail I have taken root_
      Under the stairs, my son, under the stairs._

    _"Do not avenge me, Henry. Let all slide.
      I grudge your death. See, do not touch the snake.
    A cowardice taints you from your father's side
      And a coward's lusts, but curb them, for my sake!_

    "Back to your grave, back Father, lest she wake!"


    Two full hours before the dawn,
      Dotard Parrot cocks an ear
    To the sleeper's moan, long-drawn,
      To her slurring tale of fear.

    Parrot hears Delilah tell
      Who lies dead below the stair;
    How he shuddered, stumbled, fell;
      In whose cause she laid him there.

    _The knife bit, thus: thus, the blood spread!_
      Connoisseur of fo'c'stle speeches
    Parrot tilts his bald, sly head,
      Learns the spicy yarn she teaches.

    Soon, when sunlight warms his cage,
      He plots to cheer the passers-by
    With burlesque of murderous rage,
      Acting how his victims die:
    Thus, he stabs 'em; there, they lie.

Last Poems
THE WEST
     Beyond the moor and the mountain crest
     -- Comrade, look not on the west -- 
     The sun is down and drinks away
     From air and land the lees of day.

     The long cloud and the single pine
     Sentinel the ending line,
     And out beyond it, clear and wan,
     Reach the gulfs of evening on.

     The son of woman turns his brow
     West from forty countries now,
     And, as the edge of heaven he eyes,
     Thinks eternal thoughts, and sighs.

     Oh wide's the world, to rest or roam,
     With change abroad and cheer at home,
     Fights and furloughs, talk and tale,
     Company and beef and ale.

     But if I front the evening sky
     Silent on the west look I,
     And my comrade, stride for stride,
     Paces silent at my side,

     Comrade, look not on the west:
     'Twill have the heart out of your breast;
     'Twill take your thoughts and sink them far,
     Leagues beyond the sunset bar.

     Oh lad, I fear that yon's the sea
     Where they fished for you and me,
     And there, from whence we both were ta'en,
     You and I shall drown again.

     Send not on your soul before
     To dive from that beguiling shore,
     And let not yet the swimmer leave
     His clothes upon the sands of eve.

     Too fast to yonder strand forlorn
     We journey, to the sunken bourn,
     To flush the fading tinges eyed
     By other lads at eventide.

     Wide is the world, to rest or roam,
     And early 'tis for turning home:
     Plant your heel on earth and stand,
     And let's forget our native land.

     When you and I are split on air
     Long we shall be strangers there;
     Friends of flesh and bone are best;
     Comrade, look not on the west.



     As I gird on for fighting
         My sword upon my thigh,
     I think on old ill fortunes
         Of better men than I.

     Think I, the round world over,
         What golden lads are low
     With hurts not mine to mourn for
         And shames I shall not know.

     What evil luck soever
         For me remains in store,
     'Tis sure much finer fellows
         Have fared much worse before.

     So here are things to think on
         That ought to make me brave,
     As I strap on for fighting
         My sword that will not save.


     Her strong enchantments failing,
         Her towers of fear in wreck,
     Her limbecks dried of poisons
         And the knife at her neck,

     The Queen of air and darkness
         Begins to shrill and cry,
     `O young man, O my slayer,
         To-morrow you shall die.`

     O Queen of air and darkness,
         I think 'tis truth you say,
     And I shall die to-morrow;
         But you will die to-day.



ILLIC JACET
     Oh hard is the bed they have made him,
         And common the blanket and cheap;
     But there he will lie as they laid him:
         Where else could you trust him to sleep?

     To sleep when the bugle is crying
         And cravens have heard and are brave,
     When mothers and sweethearts are sighing
         And lads are in love with the grave.

     Oh dark is the chamber and lonely,
         And lights and companions depart;
     But lief will he lose them and only
         Behold the desire of his heart.

     And low is the roof, but it covers
         A sleeper content to repose;
     And far from his friends and his lovers
         He lies with the sweetheart he chose.


GRENADIER
     The Queen she sent to look for me,
         The sergeant he did say,
     `Young man, a soldier will you be
         For thirteen pence a day?`

     For thirteen pence a day did I
         Take off the things I wore,
     And I have marched to where I lie,
         And I shall march no more.

     My mouth is dry, my shirt is wet,
         My blood runs all away,
     So now I shall not die in debt
         For thirteen pence a day.

     To-morrow after new young men
         The sergeant he must see,
     For things will all be over then
         Between the Queen and me.

     And I shall have to bate my price,
         For in the grave, they say,
     Is neither knowledge nor device
         Nor thirteen pence a day.



LANCER
     I 'listed at home for a lancer,
         Oh who would not sleep with the brave?
     I 'listed at home for a lancer
         To ride on a horse to my grave.

     And over the seas we were bidden
         A country to take and to keep;
     And far with the brave I have ridden,
         And now with the brave I shall sleep.

     For round me the men will be lying
         That learned me the way to behave.
     And showed me my business of dying:
         Oh who would not sleep with the brave?

     They ask and there is not an answer;
     Says I, I will 'list for a lancer,
         Oh who would not sleep with the brave?

     And I with the brave shall be sleeping
         At ease on my mattress of loam,
     When back from their taking and keeping
         The squadron is riding home.

     The wind with the plumes will be playing,
         The girls will stand watching them wave,
     And eyeing my comrades and saying
         Oh who would not sleep with the brave?

     They ask and there is not an answer;
     Says you, I will 'list for a lancer,
         Oh who would not sleep with the brave?




     In valleys green and still
         Where lovers wander maying
     They hear from over hill
         A music playing.

     Behind the drum and fife,
         Past hawthornwood and hollow,
     Through earth and out of life
         The soldiers follow.

     The soldier's is the trade:
         In any wind or weather
     He steals the heart of maid
         And man together.

     The lover and his lass
         Beneath the hawthorn lying
     Have heard the soldiers pass,
         And both are sighing.

     And down the distance they
         With dying note and swelling
     Walk the resounding way
         To the still dwelling.


     Soldier from the wars returning,
         Spoiler of the taken town,
     Here is ease that asks not earning;
         Turn you in and sit you down.

     Peace is come and wars are over,
         Welcome you and welcome all,
     While the charger crops the clover
         And his bridle hangs in stall.

     Now no more of winters biting,
         Filth in trench from fall to spring,
     Summers full of sweat and fighting
         For the Kesar or the King.

     Rest you, charger, rust you, bridle;
         Kings and kesars, keep your pay;
     Soldier, sit you down and idle
         At the inn of night for aye.


     The chestnut casts his flambeaux, and the flowers
         Stream from the hawthorn on the wind away,
     The doors clap to, the pane is blind with showers.
         Pass me the can, lad; there's an end of May.

     There's one spoilt spring to scant our mortal lot,
         One season ruined of our little store.
     May will be fine next year as like as not:
         Oh ay, but then we shall be twenty-four.

     We for a certainty are not the first
         Have sat in taverns while the tempest hurled
     Their hopeful plans to emptiness, and cursed
         Whatever brute and blackguard made the world.

     It is in truth iniquity on high
         To cheat our sentenced souls of aught they crave,
     And mar the merriment as you and I
         Fare on our long fool's-errand to the grave.

     Iniquity it is; but pass the can.
         My lad, no pair of kings our mothers bore;
     Our only portion is the estate of man:
         We want the moon, but we shall get no more.

     If here to-day the cloud of thunder lours
         To-morrow it will hie on far behests;
     The flesh will grieve on other bones than ours
         Soon, and the soul will mourn in other breasts.

     The troubles of our proud and angry dust
         Are from eternity, and shall not fail.
     Bear them we can, and if we can we must.
         Shoulder the sky, my lad, and drink your ale.



     Could man be drunk for ever
         With liquor, love, or fights,
     Lief should I rouse at morning
         And lief lie down of nights.

     But men at whiles are sober
         And think by fits and starts,
     And if they think, they fasten
         Their hands upon their hearts.


     Yonder see the morning blink:
         The sun is up, and up must I,
     To wash and dress and eat and drink
     And look at things and talk and think
         And work, and God knows why.

     Oh often have I washed and dressed
         And what's to show for all my pain?
     Let me lie abed and rest:
     Ten thousand times I've done my best
         And all's to do again.


         The laws of God, the laws of man,
     He may keep that will and can;
     Not I:  let God and man decree
     Laws for themselves and not for me;
     And if my ways are not as theirs
     Let them mind their own affairs.
     Their deeds I judge and much condemn,
     Yet when did I make laws for them?
     Please yourselves, say I, and they
     Need only look the other way.
     But no, they will not; they must still
     Wrest their neighbour to their will,
     And make me dance as they desire
     With jail and gallows and hell-fire.
     And how am I to face the odds
     Of man's bedevilment and God's?
     I, a stranger and afraid
     In a world I never made.
     They will be master, right or wrong;
     Though both are foolish, both are strong,
     And since, my soul, we cannot fly
     To Saturn or Mercury,
     Keep we must, if keep we can,
     These foreign laws of God and man.


THE DESERTER
     "What sound awakened me, I wonder,
         For now 'tis dumb."
     "Wheels on the road most like, or thunder:
         Lie down; 'twas not the drum.:

     "Toil at sea and two in haven
         And trouble far:
     Fly, crow, away, and follow, raven,
         And all that croaks for war."

     "Hark, I heard the bugle crying,
         And where am I?
     My friends are up and dressed and dying,
         And I will dress and die."

     "Oh love is rare and trouble plenty
         And carrion cheap,
     And daylight dear at four-and-twenty:
         Lie down again and sleep."

     "Reach me my belt and leave your prattle:
         Your hour is gone;
     But my day is the day of battle,
         And that comes dawning on.

     "They mow the field of man in season:
         Farewell, my fair,
     And, call it truth or call it treason,
         Farewell the vows that were."

     "Ay, false heart, forsake me lightly:
         'Tis like the brave.
     They find no bed to joy in rightly
         Before they find the grave.

     "Their love is for their own undoing.
         And east and west
     They scour about the world a-wooing
         The bullet in their breast.

     "Sail away the ocean over,
         Oh sail away,
     And lie there with your leaden lover
         For ever and a day."


THE CULPRIT
     The night my father got me
         His mind was not on me;
     He did not plague his fancy
         To muse if I should be
         The son you see.

     The day my mother bore me
         She was a fool and glad,
     For all the pain I cost her,
         That she had borne the lad
         That borne she had.

     My mother and my father
         Out of the light they lie;
     The warrant would not find them,
         And here 'tis only I
         Shall hang so high.

     Oh let not man remember
         The soul that God forgot,
     But fetch the county kerchief
         And noose me in the knot,
         And I will rot.

     For so the game is ended
         That should not have begun.
     My father and my mother
         They had a likely son,
         And I have none.



EIGHT O'CLOCK
     He stood, and heard the steeple
         Sprinkle the quarters on the morning town.
     One, two, three, four, to market-place and people
         It tossed them down.

     Strapped, noosed, nighing his hour,
         He stood and counted them and cursed his luck;
     And then the clock collected in the tower
         Its strength, and struck.


SPRING MORNING
     Star and coronal and bell
         April underfoot renews,
     And the hope of man as well
         Flowers among the morning dews.

     Now the old come out to look,
         Winter past and winter's pains.
     How the sky in pool and brook
         Glitters on the grassy plains.

     Easily the gentle air
         Wafts the turning season on;
     Things to comfort them are there,
         Though 'tis true the best are gone.

     Now the scorned unlucky lad
         Rousing from his pillow gnawn
     Mans his heart and deep and glad
         Drinks the valiant air of dawn.

     Half the night he longed to die,
         Now are sown on hill and plain
     Pleasures worth his while to try
         Ere he longs to die again.

     Blue the sky from east to west
         Arches, and the world is wide,
     Though the girl he loves the best
         Rouses from another's side.



ASTRONOMY
     The Wain upon the northern steep
         Descends and lifts away.
     Oh I will sit me down and weep
         For bones in Africa.

     For pay and medals, name and rank,
         Things that he has not found,
     He hove the Cross to heaven and sank
         The pole-star underground.

     And now he does not even see
         Signs of the nadir roll
     At night over the ground where he
         Is buried with the pole.



     The rain, it streams on stone and hillock,
         The boot clings to the clay.
     Since all is done that's due and right
     Let's home; and now, my lad, good-night,
         For I must turn away.

     Good-night, my lad, for nought's eternal;
         No league of ours, for sure.
     Tomorrow I shall miss you less,
     And ache of heart and heaviness
         Are things that time should cure.

     Over the hill the highway marches
         And what's beyond is wide:
     Oh soon enough will pine to nought
     Remembrance and the faithful thought
         That sits the grave beside.

     The skies, they are not always raining
         Nor grey the twelvemonth through;
     And I shall meet good days and mirth,
     And range the lovely lands of earth
         With friends no worse than you.

     But oh, my man, the house is fallen
         That none can build again;
     My man, how full of joy and woe
     Your mother bore you years ago
         To-night to lie in the rain.



     In midnights of November,
         When Dead Man's Fair is nigh,
     And danger in the valley,
         And anger in the sky,

     Around the huddling homesteads
         The leafless timber roars,
     And the dead call the dying
         And finger at the doors.

     Oh, yonder faltering fingers
         Are hands I used to hold;
     Their false companion drowses
         And leaves them in the cold.

     Oh, to the bed of ocean,
         To Africk and to Ind,
     I will arise and follow
         Along the rainy wind.

     The night goes out and under
         With all its train forlorn;
     Hues in the east assemble
         And cocks crow up the morn.

     The living are the living
         And dead the dead will stay,
     And I will sort with comrades
         That face the beam of day.


     The night is freezing fast,
         To-morrow comes December;
               And winterfalls of old
     Are with me from the past;
         And chiefly I remember
               How Dick would hate the cold.

     Fall, winter, fall; for he,
         Prompt hand and headpiece clever,
               Has woven a winter robe,
     And made of earth and sea
         His overcoat for ever,
               And wears the turning globe.


     The fairies break their dances
         And leave the printed lawn,
     And up from India glances
         The silver sail of dawn.

     The candles burn their sockets,
         The blinds let through the day,
     The young man feels his pockets
         And wonders what's to pay.


     The sloe was lost in flower,
         The April elm was dim;
     That was the lover's hour,
         The hour for lies and him.

     If thorns are all the bower,
         If north winds freeze the fir,
     Why, 'tis another's hour,
         The hour for truth and her.



     In the morning, in the morning,
         In the happy field of hay,
     Oh they looked at one another
         By the light of day.

     In the blue and silver morning
         On the haycock as they lay,
     Oh they looked at one another
         And they looked away.


EPITHALAMIUM
         He is here, Urania's son,
     Hymen come from Helicon;
     God that glads the lover's heart,
     He is here to join and part.
     So the groomsman quits your side
     And the bridegroom seeks the bride:
     Friend and comrade yield you o'er
     To her that hardly loves you more.

         Now the sun his skyward beam
     Has tilted from the Ocean stream.
     Light the Indies, laggard sun:
     Happy bridegroom, day is done,
     And the star from OEta's steep
     Calls to bed but not to sleep.

         Happy bridegroom, Hesper brings
     All desired and timely things.
     All whom morning sends to roam,
     Hesper loves to lead them home.
     Home return who him behold,
     Child to mother, sheep to fold,
     Bird to nest from wandering wide:
     Happy bridegroom, seek your bride.

         Pour it out, the golden cup
     Given and guarded, brimming up,
     Safe through jostling markets borne
     And the thicket of the thorn;
     Folly spurned and danger past,
     Pour it to the god at last.

         Now, to smother noise and light,
     Is stolen abroad the wildering night,
     And the blotting shades confuse
     Path and meadow full of dews;
     And the high heavens, that all control,
     Turn in silence round the pole.
     Catch the starry beams they shed
     Prospering the marriage bed,
     And breed the land that reared your prime
     Sons to stay the rot of time.
     All is quiet, no alarms;
     Nothing fear of nightly harms.
     Safe you sleep on guarded ground,
     And in silent circle round
     The thoughts of friends keep watch and ward,
     Harnessed angels, hand on sword.


THE ORACLES
     'Tis mute, the word they went to hear on high Dodona mountain
         When winds were in the oakenshaws and all the cauldrons tolled,
     And mute's the midland navel-stone beside the singing fountain,
         And echoes list to silence now where gods told lies of old.

     I took my question to the shrine that has not ceased from speaking,
         The heart within, that tells the truth and tells it twice as plain;
     And from the cave of oracles I heard the priestess shrieking
         That she and I should surely die and never live again.

     Oh priestess, what you cry is clear, and sound good sense I think it;
         But let the screaming echoes rest, and froth your mouth no more.
     'Tis true there's better boose than brine, but he that drowns must drink it;
         And oh, my lass, the news is news that men have heard before.

     The King with half the East at heel is marched from lands of morning;
         Their fighters drink the rivers up, their shafts benight the air.
     And he that stands will die for nought, and home there's no returning.
         The Spartans on the sea-wet rock sat down and combed their hair.


     The half-moon westers low, my love,
         And the wind brings up the rain;
     And wide apart lie we, my love,
         And seas between the twain.

     I know not if it rains, my love,
         In the land where you do lie;
     And oh, so sound you sleep, my love,
         You know no more than I.




     The sigh that heaves the grasses
         Whence thou wilt never rise
     Is of the air that passes
         And knows not if it sighs.

     The diamond tears adorning
         Thy low mound on the lea,
     Those are the tears of morning,
         That weeps, but not for thee.



     Now dreary dawns the eastern light,
         And fall of eve is drear,
     And cold the poor man lies at night,
         And so goes out the year.

     Little is the luck I've had,
         And oh, 'tis comfort small
     To think that many another lad
         Has had no luck at all.



     Wake not for the world-heard thunder
         Nor the chime that earthquakes toll.
     Star may plot in heaven with planet,
     Lightning rive the rock of granite,
     Tempest tread the oakwood under:
         Fear not you for flesh nor soul.
     Marching, fighting, victory past,
     Stretch your limbs in peace at last.

     Stir not for the soldiers drilling
         Nor the fever nothing cures:
     Throb of drum and timbal's rattle
     Call but man alive to battle,
     And the fife with death-notes filling
         Screams for blood but not for yours.
     Times enough you bled your best;
     Sleep on now, and take your rest.

     Sleep, my lad; the French are landed,
         London's burning, Windsor's down;
     Clasp your cloak of earth about you,
     We must man the ditch without you,
     March unled and fight short-handed,
         Charge to fall and swim to drown.
     Duty, friendship, bravery o'er,
     Sleep away, lad; wake no more.


SINNER'S RUE
     I walked alone and thinking,
         And faint the nightwind blew
     And stirred on mounds at crossways
         The flower of sinner's rue.

     Where the roads part they bury
         Him that his own hand slays,
     And so the weed of sorrow
         Springs at the four cross ways.

     By night I plucked it hueless,
         When morning broke 'twas blue:
     Blue at my breast I fastened
         The flower of sinner's rue.

     It seemed a herb of healing,
         A balsam and a sign,
     Flower of a heart whose trouble
         Must have been worse than mine.

     Dead clay that did me kindness,
         I can do none to you,
     But only wear for breastknot
         The flower of sinner's rue.


HELL'S GATE
         Onward led the road again
     Through the sad uncoloured plain
     Under twilight brooding dim,
     And along the utmost rim
     Wall and rampart risen to sight
     Cast a shadow not of night,
     And beyond them seemed to glow
     Bonfires lighted long ago.
     And my dark conductor broke
     Silence at my side and spoke,
     Saying, "You conjecture well:
     Yonder is the gate of hell."

         Ill as yet the eye could see
     The eternal masonry,
     But beneath it on the dark
     To and fro there stirred a spark.
     And again the sombre guide
     Knew my question, and replied:
     "At hell gate the damned in turn
     Pace for sentinel and burn."

         Dully at the leaden sky
     Staring, and with idle eye
     Measuring the listless plain,
     I began to think again.
     Many things I thought of then,
     Battle, and the loves of men,
     Cities entered, oceans crossed,
     Knowledge gained and virtue lost,
     Cureless folly done and said,
     And the lovely way that led
     To the slimepit and the mire
     And the everlasting fire.
     And against a smoulder dun
     And a dawn without a sun
     Did the nearing bastion loom,
     And across the gate of gloom
     Still one saw the sentry go,
     Trim and burning, to and fro,
     One for women to admire
     In his finery of fire.
     Something, as I watched him pace,
     Minded me of time and place,
     Soldiers of another corps
     And a sentry known before.

         Ever darker hell on high
     Reared its strength upon the sky,
     And our footfall on the track
     Fetched the daunting echo back.
     But the soldier pacing still
     The insuperable sill,
     Nursing his tormented pride,
     Turned his head to neither side,
     Sunk into himself apart
     And the hell-fire of his heart.
     But against our entering in
     From the drawbridge Death and Sin
     Rose to render key and sword
     To their father and their lord.
     And the portress foul to see
     Lifted up her eyes on me
     Smiling, and I made reply:
     "Met again, my lass," said I.
     Then the sentry turned his head,
     Looked, and knew me, and was Ned.

         Once he looked, and halted straight,
     Set his back against the gate,
     Caught his musket to his chin,
     While the hive of hell within
     Sent abroad a seething hum
     As of towns whose king is come
     Leading conquest home from far
     And the captives of his war,
     And the car of triumph waits,
     And they open wide the gates.
     But across the entry barred
     Straddled the revolted guard,
     Weaponed and accoutred well
     From the arsenals of hell;
     And beside him, sick and white,
     Sin to left and Death to right
     Turned a countenance of fear
     On the flaming mutineer.
     Over us the darkness bowed,
     And the anger in the cloud
     Clenched the lightning for the stroke;
     But the traitor musket spoke.

         And the hollowness of hell
     Sounded as its master fell,
     And the mourning echo rolled
     Ruin through his kingdom old.
     Tyranny and terror flown
     Left a pair of friends alone,
     And beneath the nether sky
     All that stirred was he and I.

         Silent, nothing found to say,
     We began the backward way;
     And the ebbing luster died
     From the soldier at my side,
     As in all his spruce attire
     Failed the everlasting fire.
     Midmost of the homeward track
     Once we listened and looked back;
     But the city, dusk and mute,
     Slept, and there was no pursuit.



     When I would muse in boyhood
         The wild green woods among,
     And nurse resolves and fancies
         Because the world was young,
     It was not foes to conquer,
         Nor sweethearts to be kind,
     But it was friends to die for
         That I would seek and find.

     I sought them far and found them,
         The sure, the straight, the brave,
     The hearts I lost my own to,
         The souls I could not save.
     They braced their belts about them,
         They crossed in ships the sea,
     They sought and found six feet of ground,
         And there they died for me.



     When the eye of day is shut,
         And the stars deny their beams,
     And about the forest hut
         Blows the roaring wood of dreams,

     From deep clay, from desert rock,
         From the sunk sands of the main,
     Come not at my door to knock,
         Hearts that loved me not again.

     Sleep, be still, turn to your rest
         In the lands where you are laid;
     In far lodgings east and west
         Lie down on the beds you made.

     In gross marl, in blowing dust,
         In the drowned ooze of the sea,
     Where you would not, lie you must,
         Lie you must, and not with me.



     THE FIRST OF MAY
     The orchards half the way
         From home to Ludlow fair
     Flowered on the first of May
         In Mays when I was there;
     And seen from stile or turning
         The plume of smoke would show
     Where fires were burning
         That went out long ago.

     The plum broke forth in green,
         The pear stood high and snowed,
     My friends and I between
         Would take the Ludlow road;
     Dressed to the nines and drinking
         And light in heart and limb,
     And each chap thinking
         The fair was held for him.

     Between the trees in flower
         New friends at fairtime tread
     The way where Ludlow tower
         Stands planted on the dead.
     Our thoughts, a long while after,
         They think, our words they say;
     Theirs now's the laughter,
         The fair, the first of May.

     Ay, yonder lads are yet
         The fools that we were then;
     For oh, the sons we get
         Are still the sons of men.
     The sumless tale of sorrow
         Is all unrolled in vain:
     May comes to-morrow
         And Ludlow fair again.




     When first my way to fair I took
         Few pence in purse had I,
     And long I used to stand and look
         At things I could not buy.

     Now times are altered:  if I care
         To buy a thing, I can;
     The pence are here and here's the fair,
         But where's the lost young man?

     -- To think that two and two are four
         And neither five nor three
     The heart of man has long been sore
         And long 'tis like to be.





REVOLUTION
     West and away the wheels of darkness roll,
         Day's beamy banner up the east is borne,
     Spectres and fears, the nightmare and her foal,
         Drown in the golden deluge of the morn.

     But over sea and continent from sight
         Safe to the Indies has the earth conveyed
     The vast and moon-eclipsing cone of night,
         Her towering foolscap of eternal shade.

     See, in mid heaven the sun is mounted; hark,
         The belfries tingle to the noonday chime.
     'Tis silent, and the subterranean dark
         Has crossed the nadir, and begins to climb.





EPITAPH ON AN ARMY OF MERCENARIES
     These, in the day when heaven was falling,
         The hour when earth's foundations fled,
     Followed their mercenary calling
         And took their wages and are dead.

     Their shoulders held the sky suspended;
         They stood, and earth's foundations stay;
     What God abandoned, these defended,
         And saved the sum of things for pay.





     Oh stay at home, my lad, and plough
         The land and not the sea,
     And leave the soldiers at their drill,
     And all about the idle hill
         Shepherd your sheep with me.

     Oh stay with company and mirth
         And daylight and the air;
     Too full already is the grave
     Of fellows that were good and brave
         And died because they were.


     When summer's end is nighing
         And skies at evening cloud,
     I muse on change and fortune
         And all the feats I vowed
         When I was young and proud.

     The weathercock at sunset
         Would lose the slanted ray,
     And I would climb the beacon
         That looked to Wales away
         And saw the last of day.

     From hill and cloud and heaven
         The hues of evening died;
     Night welled through lane and hollow
         And hushed the countryside,
         But I had youth and pride.

     And I with earth and nightfall
         In converse high would stand,
     Late, till the west was ashen
         And darkness hard at hand,
         And the eye lost the land.

     The year might age, and cloudy
         The lessening day might close,
     But air of other summers
         Breathed from beyond the snows,
         And I had hope of those.

     They came and were and are not
         And come no more anew;
     And all the years and seasons
         That ever can ensue
         Must now be worse and few.

     So here's an end of roaming
         On eves when autumn nighs:
     The ear too fondly listens
         For summer's parting sighs,
         And then the heart replies.


     Tell me not here, it needs not saying,
         What tune the enchantress plays
     In aftermaths of soft September
         Or under blanching mays,
     For she and I were long acquainted
         And I knew all her ways.

     On russet floors, by waters idle,
         The pine lets fall its cone;
     The cuckoo shouts all day at nothing
         In leafy dells alone;
     And traveler's joy beguiles in autumn
         Hearts that have lost their own.

     On acres of the seeded grasses
         The changing burnish heaves;
     Or marshalled under moons of harvest
         Stand still all night the sheaves;
     Or beeches strip in storms for winter
         And stain the wind with leaves.

     Possess, as I possessed a season,
         The countries I resign,
     Where over elmy plains the highway
         Would mount the hills and shine,
     And full of shade the pillared forest
         Would murmur and be mine.

     For nature, heartless, witless nature,
         Will neither care nor know
     What stranger's feet may find the meadow
         And trespass there and go,
     Nor ask amid the dews of morning
         If they are mine or no.




FANCY'S KNELL
     When lads were home from labour
         At Abdon under Clee,
     A man would call his neighbor
         And both would send for me.
     And where the light in lances
         Across the mead was laid,
     There to the dances
         I fetched my flute and played.

     Ours were idle pleasures,
         Yet oh, content we were,
     The young to wind the measures,
         The old to heed the air;
     And I to lift with playing
         From tree and tower and steep
     The light delaying,
         And flute the sun to sleep.

     The youth toward his fancy
         Would turn his brow of tan,
     And Tom would pair with Nancy
         And Dick step off with Fan;
     The girl would lift her glances
         To his, and both be mute:
     Well went the dances
         At evening to the flute.

     Wenlock Edge was umbered,
         And bright was Abdon Burf,
     And warm between them slumbered
         The smooth green miles of turf;
     Until from grass and clover
         The upshot beam would fade,
     And England over
         Advanced the lofty shade.

     The lofty shade advances,
         I fetch my flute and play:
     Come, lads, and learn the dances
         And praise the tune to-day.
     To-morrow, more's the pity,
         Away we both must hie,
     To air the ditty,
         And to earth I.


The hundred and one harlequins
Osbert Sitwell

SERENADES
SIGH soft, sigh softly,
rain-thrilled leaves,
let not your careless hands
stem the gold wind !
Let not your greensleeves
swim in its breath,
as water flowing;
lest your thin hands
make gurgle down the crystal hills
the gaudy sun's pavilions
whence he distils those showered scents
whose virtue all true turtles croon
beneath their swaying palaces.
Sing low, then, turtles,
Sigh soft, swift wind,
and, fountains, cease your flutings.
Melulla, now,
lean on your balcony! look down!
My strings shall sing.
ANSWER again you burning streams,
H Nor bend your flame, nor melt your snows,
It is not only straw that burns
To feel the hot sun look on it,
And every phoenix is not dead.

OPEN your window. Let the air flow in
alive with waterfalls of flashing wings,
so can your fever know a cooling touch
and feel the feathers of my song as such.


Is all silent in your room?
Then come down among the dew-soft lawns,
and if I knew the stairway for your feet
should lie below it in the luscious grass
and watch your coming, as one waits to feel
cooler from showering of falls
that play, like you, among the burning rocks.
Then with fulness in my arms
ripest weight down-bowed from trees
to fall through sun's heat to the green
laughing lawns more soft than water ; -- 
full with ripeness, tasted, fired,
I shall journey through the heat.
with my load of living fruit,
and if I do not like the lawns
can lay it on a yielding cloud
whose proud battlements will melt
and run, as water, at your burning touch.

SEE no breath upon the window's water,
I hear no feet below the shining trees;
must I never let the music slacken,
fold its wings away, sink on my knees ?
Will the leaves tremble till I know their tune
in fiery praise of all the licking tongues
that lap the crystal darkest night has laid
to light her feet along the fickle walls
unseen, but built again when daylight comes ?
In between these trembling leaves
and underneath the liquid light
another harvest has its sheaves,
the gold heads of the foam shine bright,
waves, as houses built on cloud,
crumble to nothing as they sail,
the windows where you once were proud
are raining water, fence and rail
that latticed all the roads of sight
are twisted rainbows, broken swords.


The way is open, where you lie,
I see the clouds climb down the sky
and lay you in the frothy waves
that run to meet you, as your slaves.
TOW wind, soft light, and the crumbling waves
L lay down their fleeces at the mouth of caves;
the lion sands become clouds and beds,
windows in the foam, cool roof for our heads.
Here are new seconds in a moment's bliss
to add a paradise to our kiss.
The unicorns gallop over the sand
to give the bird songs into my hand,
they spread their wings and move their tongues,
the leaves are lute-strings to their lungs,
the clouds dissolve and shower-down, sharp,
rain that the wind plucks as a harp;
the music bridges the shallow stream
that cuts reality from this dream,
to cross it, listen with keen ears;
this voice that sings shall ease your fears.

THE trees are shaking down their gold,
tumbling this homage from the sun,
a gentle wind plays with the leaves
and lies where he can watch the clouds;
he feels the green, and eats the fruit,
quite near his youngest lambs begin
to leap across the hills and climb
until they frisk among the burning rocks
and leave their wool upon the peaks.
The shepherd jumps up, leaves the shade,
and runs to rally his wide flock
and knows their presence from these wisps
and hears them bleating from the plain.

So I must start, and leave the trees
and come down to the water's edge.
The water rings are near the shore
and when they break their silver chain,
I'll hear the foam that sings the more
it touches all that gives me pain.

ARE the caves cool with water
n that you sleep there hiding from the eager sun
and make me wait an hour of slowness
while I watch the sparks that run
to kindle in among the leaves,
the tongues of flame that leap this hour
to sing more loudly than the seas
before their waves can splash your tower?
If you are cool, I know the spray
has reached you with its gentle rain,
the cave you lie in, is alive
with fiery tongues to please your brain;
those trembling strings cannot be blind,
they are not sightless with their sound,
they sing still sweeter till they find
the crystal and the snow that wound.

I LOSE my treasure bit by bit,
it slides like sand and tells my wit
the riches that I've stored for you
are there to squander for us two.
Then I will spend them till the fields
glow in the gold my harvest yields,
and when we've gathered, I will sow
so you may lie to watch it grow.
A second summer in one spring
will fire our fancy, till a wing
winnowing the windy air

will lift us on its feathers there.
The clouds, whose battlements will melt
to run as water, when they felt
your burning touch, will open wide
and show the sources of their pride.
The gentle flowers, the hills of snow,
the unicorns, the birds you know
that sing out till you sleep and dream
are now as living as they seem;
then go on sleeping, do not wake!
Your wants I'll find, your thirst I'll slake.

I BURN with equal fires, not knowing my desires
I nor fear the bitter thrills, cool snow for burning hills,
the dying from fulfilment;
and know what things my will meant
in an image of white opening wings
fanning softness, life that stings
now blood runs in my watery veins
flooding them with summer rains
that fall to raise the gentle wind
which fills a sail, in sleep you find
the snows have melted from the hills
that I can compass, keep from ills ;
the lance I ride with is just right
to pierce the fruit that shine so bright,
dangling from the leaves that shake
to lose the treasure that I take.
The living pillars that I hold
and guard with loving for their gold
move their music as a beam
drops from a cloud, and turns to steam,
they melt their rapture into mine
and fill each curve with tingling line
until the sail fills and the air
sings with each cloud and shouts out loud,
the sun who combs his glittering hair
from glassy ocean answers proud.

WHERE is the balm that hides the phoenix breast
who dies, but liveth by his wings so blest;
his gold sails furled, but fiery with the light,
his feathers molten in the hot sun's sight?
Pulseless heart, blind eyes, and breathless mouth,
dead to the waters that can cure his drouth.
If I can find it, will swift blood again
spring in my fountains, strike my leaves like rain,
cool white sails, fill the broad lake to its brink,
offer the thirsty melting snows for their drink?
His plumes are painted, but their power is gone,
lost are the treasures that my pride had won;
the phoenix floats among the flames, and breathes;
may I, then, live again to cut the sheathes.
To store your treasure till I try the taste
and know our feasting will not leave a waste.
Now can I burn, and know the balm is true,
for flames but kindle, as the phoenix knew;
full of this spice he drifted into the sun
who lapped his feathers with fire, made the run
of his raiment, plume on plume, into wings;
the shortlived pleasure and the sleep that stings
for renouncing it, these are the forging fire -- 
new wings for the phoenix; and end to my ire.

THE ITALIAN AIR
IN among the apple trees
and on their echoing golden roofs,
a singing shower rides on the breeze,
and prints the grass with crystal hoofs.
The sighing music faints and fails
among the far-off feathered boughs,
the birds fold up their painted sails ;
but voices sound, until they rouse
the sleeping birds and silent leaves ;
and now a harp once more resounds,
to utter what her heart believes
and what her trembling sense confounds.
His daring loudness wakes the house
that sleeps beneath a staring sun,
the birds awake: the cattle browse :
the page jumps down, begins to run
across the flower-beds; now there rings
another voice of sterner kind,
the harp still sounds; Figaro sings
to ease his master's troubled mind.
Her thoughts now hold him in a net,
he fills the meshes and respires,
low boughs of fruit-trees, lush and wet,
drop rain on him, while from the spires
a bell sets shaking every glass,
rattles the windows in the trees,
he strains the meshes, tries to pass,
but now the bells die on the breeze,
This sudden stillness brings again
the silence when his song was done,
the notes that melted all her pain;
the sunset failing of the sun
robs the shadows of their gold,
and as night darkens, he goes back,
the bleating lambs are in the fold,
and all the cattle walk the track
that leads along the grass to home,
he steals among them through the gate;
they, within these walls, can roam;
but he is prisoned by hard Fate,
and led by chains within this yard
whose frontiers are the barren walls,
the windows of this house are barred,
there sound no footsteps in its halls ;
when suddenly a light shines out,
Figaro whispers from the sill,
the subtle winds run forth and shout
leaving their shelters on the hill;
they drop from trees, come forth from caves
and fill the valley with their noise,
they sing like rivers, foam like waves,
and roof this wanderer with the poise
of plumes that shut off light and drown
hot words with soaring of loud wings,
they screen the clamour of the town,
and let him breathe the fire he brings
to fill his heart and touch with flame
her fancy, as she hears the rungs
upon the ladder creak his name
and all the fountains flash their tongues.
They sing like birds and preen their feathers
the nearer Cherubino goes
the brighter burn their plumes in weathers
far too fiery for the rose,
and climbing, he will comb his hair
and trim his wings for further flight,
will turn the currents in the air
to make them watch this lovely sight;
For she will draw him in her net
until he reaches her high stage
still painted with the fruit and wet,
this bird will burst his brittle cage.
He will cross the broken bars
and fly between the golden scales,
his waving plumes will flash like stars,
and cool the Heavens with their sails.
Now he rests upon the ledge
preparing for this last short leap,
before his newest wings can fledge.
She leaps and saves him from the deep,
she draws him from those crystal fields
still smelling of sweet juice and foam,
he sinks with his last breath, and yields,
her arm is strong to lift him home.
And now to mask the noisy night,
to muffle words and mute the feet,
Figaro strikes the strings, and bright
the harp rings with its sudden beat :
Count Almaviva stirs in sleep
and wakes to look out through the dark,
he marks a bleating of the sheep,
and, like the oars that push a bark,
he hears the strings that carry song
and listens to the serenade,
he little knew the grievous wrong
that lurked behind the cloak it made.

For now the page unclosed his eyes,
and kindled with the fire again,
he saw, in front of him, the prize
to solace all his long-lived pain.
Before the gift was in his hands
there came a moment of fierce thrills,
he smoothed down the soft yellow strands,
and preened the music of his quills.
Just then a gentle rain began
to fall among the apple trees,
the harp played louder, and there ran
a shiver and a sound of bees
as all the winds came home to rest
and perched among the glittering boughs
they shook each leaf, and turned its vest
more gorgeous than the man who ploughs
will find the summer fields he reaps,
for each leaf shook and showed the moon;
in cloudless sky and in the deeps
a strength arose, a subtle boon.
For light shone in the room and showed
more clear than any waterfall,
the flame that burnt more where it snowed,
until the fire hid with its pall,
a thick cocoon, the life within
that smouldered, now to start afresh
and break out from the senseless skin
with ready wings and living flesh.
These silk-worms spin the sheathing cloth
that lies about our limbs like sleep,
it will not burn with flame, no moth
can spoil the glow its colours keep;

And they shall sew themselves some wings
with silken feathers for the clouds
to feel the speed their fancy brings
as they will pass those drifting crowds
that wander, mob-like, on the road
before a wind can herd them on,
and where they saw a river flowed,
or, looking for a lake, found one,
above the foam of waves, they float
to sleep in softness, as of air
while, with slow motion, like a boat,
they glide on, and he smoothes her hair.


FABLES

WHO taught the centaur first to drink
Ladling his huge hands from the brink -- 
When other monsters lie and lap
The waters like a fruitful pap?
The same who by ingenious ways
Taught the chameleon his rays
To take from leaves of tow'ring trees
Strung thick with dew-bells that the bees
Set ringing, till they bring the honey,
Thrilled with music, gold with money
Back to their castles in the clouds
And the chameleon, his crowds
Of foes to fight with, has two eyes
That travel sideways, no surprise
On any side. He swiftly sees
All -- flowers, slow floating birds and bees.
The gentle, loving unicorn
Will never eat the grass -- 
All bushes have too many thorns,
Their leaves are made of brass.
His horn is given him to take
The soft fruit from the trees.
"Please grasp my horn and roughly shake,
O nymph, among those leaves;
This pear transfixed upon my horn;
I cannot reach"-beyond the brim;
Clutched at; she misses; it has gone.
"Alas! You've got it !" "I can't swim."
To comb a satyr's silken beard
Arabian travellers aspire,
They beg, they bribe; more loved than feared
The satyr trots to take his hire -- 
Fawning, he takes from outstretched hand
Such fruit his eyes have sometimes seen

On swaying branches where the land
Sighs in a soft wind and the green
Leaves shake beneath the nightingale.
Thus cajoled, they can reach his beard
Where gums lie, gathered from the frail
Flowers he feeds on, where no voice is heard.



CHURCH AND STAGE

Beating the marble floor with well-drilled, giddy precision,
The hosts of aspirants are on the safest road to Heaven.
De facto, or indeed, before they see
The bubble of our pride above their head,
The sound of far-surpassing seraph voices
May raise you, for a moment only, with the dead.
And there you have the chance I so desire
To hear the singing of the true elect
Who celebrate, above our carnal hire -- 
For friendship only -- their most happy state.
The seraphs and the cherubim
Are singing through the crystal leaves
That guard the empty balconies
And echo round the silent eaves.
The pagan halcyons confine
Their soft-breathed flutings to the lifeless woods,
That with their brittle arms entwine
The zephyrs hiding from the gold-maned sun.
And hidden from the peeping eyes
Of prostrate multitudes who pray,
The famous vocalist outpours
The song of nightingales at play.
Provincial daughters, every whim,
As every caprice, gratified,
Your chattering voices raise the hymn
As a pure flower of thanksgiving


Outside, like tumbling acrobats
On green-spread carpets who let fall
Their weary limbs before the town,
The fountain flashing through the tall
And agitated trees throw down
The showering, scintillating plumes,
As if, above the hollow town,
Among the feeding flocks of clouds,
Great birds are clinging to the flowers
Our feeble voices prosper in the air,
In hopes of reaching the unshuttered light
Behind which burns the molten god-like hair.

VALSE ESTUDIANTINA
A wall of cactus guards the virgin sound -- 
O Dripping through the sword-edged leaves
The wayward milking
Of your mental stalactites
On the strung bells of music,
Arrests the moment,
Petrifies the air.
As you trudge along the path
Laid down before you,
Counting all the trees
Remembering the turnings
Instead of resting on the wooden seats,
You lie among the thistles in the sun.
Your poor jangle spreads along the street,
Filtering the voices of the passer-by,
Embroidering the singing in the lines of wire,
And masking as with histrionic aim
The bird-sound of long-distance messages.
Now with a practised hand
The music-master will release the waltz
That makes a difference in our lives.
With one hand on the railing
To feel the rings of sound,
One might emphasise the vision -- 
Some are sitting under lame-touched trees
Where the generous sun
Has run the fierce green plumes
Set quivering on the harp-strings of the boughs,
Has run them to a fine fire of gold,
Has quickened them, s
As islands cut the currents of the sea,
To the full spun colour
Of the floating jewels
That part the wind's gold hair,
And fill the ultimate sea
With all its canopy of clouds,

And tents of quick blue hills
With the new message of their incense-cells.
Beneath these trees
The suffocated crowd extends
Its troubled surface,
Till toying with another figured shape.
The extreme couples lie among the grass.
This tune brings evening ringing down
On the well-bedecked windows of the day,
And rising on their tired feet,
Running the fingers through their flower-decked hair,
They leave the vast arena of the band
Moving on the tight-rope of the tune.
Ring out, ring out now, ring out now,
The blare of your hundred brass trumpets
Shake the leaves down, shake the leaves down,
Make the clouds dance like flowers in the wind.
In the darkening room
You sit beside the piano
Where the music-master
Stretches his shadow.
As he moves his hands,
In your mind ringing on its meals,
The rightful tunes to play
Are the sweet songs of birds,
The yaps of dogs,
Hot water tapping in the leaden pipes, -- 
As a final consummation
Father arriving by the evening train



From "THE HUNDRED AND ONE
HARLEQUINS "

APRO'S LANDLADY
MRS. SERAPION knocks upon the door,
The sun has risen from his couch upon the floor.
"Mr. Grimaldi ! seven o'clock !"
Above the foam of the sea he shows,
And Harlequin jumps from his bed of snows,
While Mrs. Serapion warns the block.
He walks to the window where a tree grows in,
Stirring the leaves that are green and thin.
He shaves. He washes. And he combs his hair.

AT BREAKFAST
A glass of milk as white as your hand,
The foam of seas that lie on the land,
Their grass runs swift in the wind like a wave;
A cup of this foam : -- and then I crave
Snow-bread that the hills have ground their gold to!"
The cheap shepherdess replied,
Her words still-born-dead drowned by the roar.
A railway engine ran across the field
Galloping like a swift horse down the rails.
As it came quicker the window-panes rattled,
The roof shook side to side : all its beams trembled,
Thundering hoofs were upon us -- glass chariots.

READING THE PAPER
THE second train he boarded with a paper,
He hides behind it from his fellows,
This bird-mask let him know the news,
He sees, like they do, from the air.

There they ride, each person in the carriage,
Each of them steering his cloud through the air.
All that goes on in the world they gather.
A visor to guard, and a mask to protect them.
Now, with their speed the white mane flows loose.

IN THE TRAIN
IN crystal chariots drawn by unicorns,
As did old Fortunatus in his day:
I can shine in loud streets with honour,
Grip the gold reins and go just where I will :
Ride from the town beneath an arch
Whose bricks like honeycombs shall store my name
Beside the river we will gallop.
My rattling wheels outpace the drifting float
Of leaves that whirl among the river's eddies
As fell strong towns that glittered as my foes : -- 
Down to where it mingles with the sea
Fanning new freshness to the foaming waves.
Just there my unicorns sniff in the salt,
Worry the water with white trembling feet,
Whinny their pleasure, and turn back again.

AT THE TAILOR'S
ORIMALDI never answered his tailor,
He looked in the glass and was far too busy.
"Forgive the liberty, bend your elbow.
Where do you want the outside pocket ?"
Such words and scissors are too worldly!
What did God say when he ordered birds ?
"I insist on at least two coats a year
And made of material that will not tear.
They shall search the grass to find their food,
Leaving a flash of light where they stood.

In case on their search they find some fruit
They shall float in the air and have wings to suit.
Crests I'll allow them as gay as flowers
And plumes that gleam bright as jewels, even through showers.
But I won't have them always calling My name,
They must imitate man, and make him feel shame."

ON THE TELEPHONE
HE crouched like a monster at the bottom of a pool,
T The glass pane showed him there huddled on his stool :
The jangling sledges that he overheard
On snow more sleek than the feathers of a bird
Glided along behind high-stepping horses,
And the voice of Madame Hanska rang loud in the pauses.
The man who wrote novels and had such queer manners
Liked a fierce polonaise with its proud flying banners;
If he could have heard the noise down these cold wires
I think he'd grow tired of a tune that perspires :
The tinkling pagodas of coloratura
With bells of harmonic glass, sweeter, far purer,
Than all the cascades of sound rung by the clowns
Who cool with their water-songs all the hot towns :
The tenor who grates, and loud-sighing contralto
Should sing from their barges beneath the Rialto :
There they may stay, while the telephone carries
The fur-footed dance of a person he marries.

PORTRAIT OF MR. GEO. F. M. AIREY-A SECRETARY
SO many thousand portraits,
Never yet has a Harlequin been taken
As he sits inside a window at unruffled glass !
He sits mouthing like a goldfish;
None of his words can creak out from the water.
Cocked-hat like a peacock perking and prying,
The window is his telescope and he's our admiral.

He will have the clouds here and there!
The ships with big sails bear the brunt of the fighting.
Wind will carry the lighter ships
Round the enemies' wings towards the harbour town.
The Harlequin crew run like lightning up the ropes,
They sputter through the dashing waves
And don't lose their colour.
Wherever there is lighter wind and no curving waves
They are standing in the windows of their blue-black caves.

FROM A HILL-TOP
SEE the ordered world,
I fast gurgling rivers and the slower falls
gliding, like slow music, through gold plains.
Look how the clouds dance
Turning as each wave of the wind breaks !
These waterfalls, these fiery snows,
for music and for dancing ground;
here for their pleasure shall the tyrants tremble
and tread this glistening lawn before their wives.
While they slumber we will help ourselves.
First to the fruit that lit each tree with fire,
and then to the flames that flicker through these leaves.
Take heed they burn not,
while you sever, flame from smoke -- 
but soon as they're parted, every tongue begins,
they flicker and sing forth again,
singing like loud stars the while they dance.

THE HOCHZEIT OF HERCULES
AT the first sound of sun
for which the leaves hold still their ears,
I leave my bed and run
forgetful of my years ;
in summer when the birds sing louder
I quickly reach the waterside
and flash my muscles in the light,
for the water soothes me
and I like to break the waves
that tease me as I cannot swim.
I stand there as a statue, my reflex curved and bent below,
while the green grass is laid for me to roll on
and the tall trees clap their coloured wings
hiding the fruits I love.
I drop the chains, and lift my hands
leaving this mirror for the sun,
and run, all naked, to the horizontal bar,
whereon I swing in unison
to solar rules and lunar orderings.
I swing back a moment, gain momentum,
rise to the top, and ride my bar again.
From here I see the ordered world
fast gurgling rivers and the slower falls
gliding like slow music down the hills,
and listening, mark the many lutes
played behind windows in the golt-lit trees,
answered by fierce plucking of the strings
from fields fingered by the wind : -- 
then as the music drifts away to start
the far-off machinery of sea,
my hour arrives to dive into the dark
and watch, head downward, the fire-plumed eyes
that order all our happenings -- 
upon this plateau now I stand
fulfilling my first promise of giant strength,
throwing great weights across a belt of sea,
or buffeting the clouds with closed fists.
Shall I shatter mountains as a house of glass
and throw the shivering sea across my back,

would you like to see me with a load of Towns
stepping on far islands to attain the sky ?
Just as clear as my reflection I can see
the imitations offered in your land,
the strong man throwing pebbles for a bet
and batting in the summer to a band,
climbing little hills with crooked sticks
instead of smashing them in fragments as I do,
and swimming like tired rabbits in a pond,
though this, I know, is more ...
There are twelve shadows in my foaming wake
More lasting than my labours and more keen,
they stand there stronger than the hills I shake
and challenge all the splendour that has been.
I have no patience with the men of brains
who wear their armour to ward off my chains,
the straining of my fetters gives me space,
their steel is but a mirror to my face,
their lovely treasures need a shield to keep,
before I go to take them, and they weep;
the battery and cunning of my arm
sounds louder than shrill trumpets to alarm.
Early in the morning all the bells began
before the trees felt wind to fan
white sails into a landlocked bay
where the dead deep sea showed a cloudless day.
These ships had glided through the night
to see the splendour, share the sight
when Hercules, triumphant, rides
with tigers and the crouching tides.
He has taken from fat kings
their motor cars and diamond rings,
the fountains tumble while they shine
with running nectar, sacred wine.
The sailors jump in the surf, and swim,
they need not do it-it's a whim -- 
they climb on the pier, dripping, cold,
and run to the nectar as if it were gold.

Hercules still is inside the church,
while the brimming fountains glisten and sing,
he joins in the service till the windows ring,
the captains marshal their companies,
extending to line the street;
glass chariots wait at the church door,
the unicorns fidget their feet.
Now
down
the aisle
he's walking
in his
five-league boots :
A flash
and
he's through
the portal,
posing there
for the reporters.
They could not open the chariot,
they drove with it, shut, behind crystal ;
the coachman and the postillions
had all they could do to move off.
They drove like a fireball falling down the sky,
the unicorns galloped with them almost off the ground
the wheels and the windows flashed their fire.
Who can say what the fountain thought
when they dashed round a corner
splashing right through its spray?
Down the Marina, by the side of the sea,
they stopped for a moment to receive an address.
Hercules stepped out of his chariot
and then assisted his bride to get down.
He held in his hand the casket they gave him,
the golden key, and the message on vellum :
cries of "Speech" ... "Speech"...
Such a crowd, and such shouting,
they were none of them silent.
When he spoke it was like a concerto for piano
played by a student with the orchestra too big.
We could just hear:....
"Remember I am not a thinker . . . plain soldier,
simple, and ... read or write ...
... Please ... declare open . . . with pleasure ...
... I shall have . . . thankfully ...
... sure I shall never forget. ..."
"Good-bye," into the chariot and off again.
All round the town, up and down the avenues,
constantly appearing at the end of views :
with military bands in every square
keeping up the awnings and doing their share,
till now, at last, they reach the courtyard of the Palace,
in front of them the sea that's live with fishing boat and pinnace.
For by now the sailors having tasted nectar
row to their ships again and sail out to sea,
they tack near the terraces, and look for Hercules
finishing his banquet in a gallery of glass ;
they throw rope-ladders and they climb up through the pilasters
leaning on the battlements like pinnacles of Heaven;
down in the banquet-hall they see their hero
hurrying through his dinner so that he may join them.
Now that the wedding, the procession, and the banquet,
all are finished, he is free to end the day
exhibiting his strength before the city and the bay.
First he breaks an iron bar,
snapping it to fragments,
then he takes a tree and shakes it
like a baby's rattle till its roots leave the ground;
he stands in a little stream
damming its current
till the waters well up high and shake themselves like lions;
now when they're fierce enough
he steps aside:
out they come, rolling, running,
leaping over the heads of the other,
salt, weaker waves;

the boats in the bay ride over them,
jumping their own horses in the rolling fields of sea ;
they pass the vessels and they fall upon an island,
surge over the rocks
with their streaming manes in the wind.
By this time Hercules hides behind a hill,
and the sun is also hidden
behind dark windows in the glass-clear sea.
Hercules is back in his bedroom,
he sleeps with arms akimbo and a sword by his side,
lulled by the songs his wife sings softly;
he stirs at a sentrie's tread,
and wakes when his unicorns whinny from their stables.
But the horses of the sun have already left their stalls :
they stand in the chariot traces
trembling cold in the early wind
that runs round shaking all the bells upon the trees.
The sun comes down the steps out of his house
looking at the clouds
to choose the road he'll take among them,
then he climbs into the chariot and they rattle up the sky -- 
while Hercules is sleeping, lulled by music, far below.


ET IN ARCADIA, OMNES
(From, " The Bird-Actors ")
THE stars, but prophets call them sons of God,
Lay in the fresh field, and the cool wind trod,
Striding, across the bodies where they slept
And woke them to the glory that they kept
All day in bondage until darkness came,
When movement flowed as water, gold as flame.
The gods now rise and let the new light run
Rippling its quick strong life and substance spun
From fluttering wings and fiery breasts of clouds
Along their limbs just risen from the shrouds
Of death-like slumber till they play again ;
Blue hills, far islands watch them, and the plain.
Above white clouds the stars come from their tent
On which to-day's dead light spills lustre, spent,
And feeble after fiery beams and bars
Have burned the sea with madness, earth with wars,
And made still waters mirror in their glass
The gold hung woods, and gliding clouds that pass,
Dip their tall towers like pennons in the lake
When, hidden from the sun, their thirst they slake
Till, at the time the nightingales begin,
The clouds have vanished, and the night is thin.
Now at their settled stations in the sky
The stars are still, or spread their wings to fly,
Are motionless, or moving with their gold
Through Heavens wide as water, and as cold.
Looking between sharp edges of the leaves
Beneath black-shadowed houses, and their eaves
Still shining in the evening rain, there show
Unfolding flowers that tremble as they grow,
And several ships with glittering sails of glass
Swim the blue seas, or float beneath the mass

Of towering cliffs down which the gold men leap,
Cross the wide sands, run down the shelving steep,
Ride on the foam, and climb the golden ropes
Until the soft-breathed wind fulfil their hopes.
Now that the sky is once more set with signs
From balconies above a tree that shines
With fan-like agitation of the wind
Revolving its lush petals till they bind
Their spinning dance into a formless round,
The people lean and listen to the sound
Of voices parting the dim green, and strings
That wave-like beat their foam upon the wings
Flashing below the crystal fall of song,
Which, melting, drops in music on the throng.
From bird-throats kissing the warm air there drops
The mingling of cool snow and flame through stops
Of flute-like tongues that gather fire from light
To make their honey golden to our sight.
The poorest even have their hour of pleasure
When the daylight fails
And the more advanced young women
Play the piano,
While the more advanced young men
Accompany them with song,
And those who cannot play their part,
Sit in the window.
At a late hour all the voices stop,
The day's perpetual sound is dead,
So still now
That you think the singers
Must still be in that room,
The women sleeping with the half-closed eyes
Of wax-work figures,
And the men as plaster caryatides
Upholding the low roofs of lodging-houses
On their sad, crushed heads.
The next few hours are far the best
In which to temper truth with a trite compromise.
In more imaginative lands
Our instruments are still the strings
That carry every trembling confidence
Through a half-open window -- 
Till, stepping to the water's edge,
You see your own tall shadow
In the clear windows of the water
With white pointed mask
Abetting your new self disguised ; -- 
And all the music of the air obeys
The silver presence singing in the trees
And giving time its intervals of lucid silence
While the wind touches the taut strings of the sea,
And the waterfalls of light
Drip through the leaves
Upon the dew-drenched grass.
If such and such sit in the gamut of one's life
Within the same close box of yellow bricks,
Under a mutual roof;
Bow from the windows if you walk beneath
And leash themselves to let you climb the stairs,
Is not a little latitude allowed
For subtle insolence, and half-veiled threats ?
Calling through the lattices of leaves
At those wreathed windows
Where, flower-like, the gold light hangs,
Wise birds repeat,
As echoes from cool caves,
The words they're taught.
A wall of cactus guards the virgin sound
Of piano scales
Ringing the changes
In a small schoolroom,
And on the black keys
Hammering with the hard beak of woodpeckers
On a moss-grown tree.

From all around young ardent voices
Reiterate the aged sentiments,
While a brave few try the spiral stairs,
Spinning like blown smoke to the glittering stars,
Half-lost in the damp breath of clouds
That tarnish the gilt edges of their song.
Through the splintered stillness
Sounds like small animals
Creep from their holes,
And from a hundred various heights,
From terraces of all the shaking fields of leaves,
The frail ladders
On which our meaning climbs
Span the blue air
Until they touch the sodden ground.
Music, that on the stooping sails of wind,
Drifting, divides the distance, and can bind
Those it has chosen with a supple string,
Keeping them motionless to feel her wing,
Can negative the constant turn of time
And make long minutes shorter than the chime
Of waters bruising the white foam of waves
Before whose rush the sea-gods seek their caves ;
Thus, at the music beating through a wall
Tired limbs revive, and shadows seem the tall
And flashing figures walking by a lake;
Known faces, unknown bodies slowly shake
Their dancing skeletons to normal flesh,
And walking in warm light within a mesh
Of memories that follow on the scent;
The once-again-remembered wishes bent
On embraces, or the easier art of flight
Centre round persons crushed beneath the might
Of phrases blown like trumpets, but to fall
Deafened by loud sound, stifled by the pall
Of soaring wings too heavy for their weight;
The music, dying, ceases, and the mate

Of every big ambition faints away,
Gone are the dreams, the darkness lives, till day
With staring light rehearses all the ills
Poured down on us each morning from the hills.
But now, before ambition starts its reign
And crowns itself within the sleeping brain,
A fitting altar for a mocking rite,
The hours arrive which offer to our sight,
In place of sun motes in a dancing air,
The lively brilliance of crowds laid bare,
And, in the place of serenading winds,
A surfeiting of subtle sound, that binds
The plumage of the trees and makes them still,
While murmurs run as water from a hill
Down to the valleys where they form a flood,
And rising, fill the veins of trees with blood,
Break the quiet spell, and run their fire along
Thrilling the leaves until they shout the song
Of rolling river and of gliding cloud,
More moving than the sea, and still more proud ;
Of boughs fanning the liquid air until
The wind comes back and breathes into each quill,
And then, quite suddenly, the birds begin
Throwing their brilliant spirals through the thin
Clear pavers to the vaster vaults of air;
White caravans of clouds are listening there;
The murmurs are soft whispering of men
Drinking the evening fall of coolness, when
The dappled light gives intervals of shade
Arching the light-ribbed dark with shadows made
Of moving shapes, and lattices of green
That trace their sudden sharpness, where, between
Tall houses and the deep-diapered woods,
Dim voices meet, and mix their various moods.
The flickering darkness covers as a cloak
Those hidden there, when certain changes broke
The set calm, and lit the still air with fire
Before whose flames the old and ill retire;


The beating blood gives wings that flash and lift
To bodies whose young signs of life they sift
From evidence and symbol of decay
To feel the freshened splendour of new day.
Rise from the ashes where you lay so long,
Stand up triumphant, resolute, and strong.
The cowering darkness is as oil to fire
Intended but to multiply your ire.
Your wings must carry you to cleave the cloud
And take the treasure from its castle proud,
Building white bastions above the waves
To hide the icy heart within its caves ;
For bribe, the gold upon the glittering trees
Lies there for you, as honey for the bees;
The streams and running currents of the air
Are path and roadway for your footstep there,
And walking them above the wide-stretched land
The flower scents reach their blossoms to your hand;
And now to send a shiver through the leaves
And thrill with melody the gathered sheaves,
Touching the fields beyond the reach of sound
To light the gathered gold upon the ground,
The clouds dissolve and show a sea of glass,
Still islands, and the floating ships that pass.
On earth once more, the music guides your feet,
Annihilating distance till you meet.
The moment comes to don your first disguise
And posture it before the sightless eyes,
Vast imbecile mentality of those
Who cannot tell a thistle from a rose;
This is for others; but for one, alone,
The altered aspect and the change of tone;
For one alone; yet others in these hours
Show greater changes and more subtle powers.
They glide in carriages past flashing green
Fans, and dropping curtains, liquid with sheen
Of waters, echoing every shaft of light
That fills an avenue too long for sight

Until the gold spoke fits the wheel on high
Moving in majesty along the sky;
From lakes that flash like mirrors or like swords
The echoes send back shuddering sounds and words
And multiply the moving shafts and wells,
Fashion new glory and invent fresh spells
To crack the glass of silence with the tongues
That throw like fountains and have fire for lungs.
They come by water with a white sail, blown
Like a taut cloud, like a gaudy shell shown
Through clear water on the pale plains of sand
As a city with carved towers on gold strand;
Or float more gently, crossing a still world
Using their oars as wings, with wide sails furled,
Make the soft sound of feathers as they dip
To wave the water back and press the lip
Floating still further on the troubled glass
That shows its secrets, and the mountain's mass.
A wanton warmness breathes on them below
The shaking smoothness, and white bodies show
That ride the slight waves holding to the manes;
Men on galloping horses down the plains.
Clearer water shows the fine limbs that tempt
The dwellers in wild places, rough, unkempt;
If such there were who lived among these woods
Crowding upon the bank, they'd fire their moods
And carry a white body to the caves
To catch the cataracting force of waves,
And gratify the unaccustomed touch;
Soothe with cool snow of limbs the heat, of such
Blind, flower-like, followers who track the sun
And know the causeways where his feet have run
Treading through clear clouds the tree-tops, below
He dyes the leaves with brilliance to show
The glittering windows and the shining roofs;
Pavilions that tremble as his hoofs
Sound in the orchards where he stoops to hang
Gold apples on high trees through which there rang
Laughter like dropping water, till, sweet tears,
The rain showers fell to dissipate their fears;
Small suffering and short-lived pain distil

This elixir of happiness, and still
Among the drums and crystal gongs of rain
Voices are calling and we know the rain
Is ended, and the brilliant fruits begin
To grow to fullness and to paint their skin.
Daring the danger and the treacherous shore,
They swim above the never-plundered store
Of shadows, where the finished cup of sky
Contains the waters, and the hills so high,
They touch the trees that wave on the far bank,
And shake the mirrored stillness of their rank.
Green are the safest places in the grass
To hide your comfort from the feet that pass,
And little caves between the trees green dark
Give you their stillness, and no need to hark
For prying voices, while near music rings
To keep the people practising their wings,
For while they tread the tight-rope of the tune
And walk on air, through clouds, as if to prune
These flowers which grow in clusters high above
The leaf-marked waters, lying there to prove
The strength of silver, or the lure of gold
As night or day, with cowardly or bold
Appearance bribes with white flowers the waves
Or, with fierce countenance controls his slaves;
Others can rest motionless, apart,
Until the moment for their play can start;
In "caverns," " leaf-hung bowers," or "grots" they lie,
And live their pastorals before the shy
Pipes or piercing trumpets make this pretence
No longer binding, and no more a fence.
From other windows, other gods may lean,
Their sons mark space with intervals of clean
Waterfalls of rippling light, golden walls,
Protecting proud gods, echo through their halls
New signs and symbols acted in the air,
Unknown to us, but seen by clear eyes there;
And from the windows each can watch his son
Leave Heavens of sparkling brilliance, to shun
The drifting gardens with sweet-breathing trees
Blown down the wide sky; for they choose the lees



And sifted dregs of goodness where they find
Sweet fruits of conquest, and of loss, combined.
As soon as ever the deep woods are still,
The hollow valley, and the hanging hill
Murmur with liquid voices, till in turn
The woods reply with fiery sounds that burn
And cleanse the dim night, for the gods to reach
Trees rising like green cliffs above a beach.
The carriages arrive, release their load
Beneath green arches, where the grass is mowed
Smooth as the sea, and through its depth as clear;
The leaves, like men on cliffs, can gaze down sheer
And watch, beneath the dancing boughs of waves,
People leaving carriages like caves,
Step into the sunlight, for a moment blind,
Dazed by the dropping splendour that they find;
They stagger like men in the far-flung spray
Of the shivered waves on a stormy day,
But the foam falling like snow down the air
Is dust in wide beams of the sun, whose hair
Gilds the blue zenith that he leaps along
With lion-like limbs and loud voice so strong.


TWO CLOWNS' PSYCHOLOGY
TN hyphenated lightning
the hoardings hammer a small word of hope
upon the motionless wide sky
whose walls are pitched upon the far-off hills
and whose torn edges
worry the molten glowing sea -- 
Set in these squares of blue or red
fierce screens for those who need a rest,
their tired eyes on the winking leaves
that rise like bubbles
in the stream of wind
and, dying,
part dry lips
and sigh their noiseless songs,
white sun above them
with its coat of crystal
shredded into shuddering blue;
these two consistently amusing men
sit, crumpled, on the tin edges
of half-a-dozen planes of light
like a tramp's bundle
hurled down in drunken fury
on the trampled metal
of one night's tenement of parched, dry field.

"If I read an evening paper,
turning pages of advertisement,
the smudged, wet print scratches the eye;
if I look up I run my glance
to coloured tin and pasted hoardings
building us a patent sky.
Is the man who makes this gifted,
is he dowered with divinity
that he prints praise upon the clouds ?
Our life must be a meal of Sundays
swallowing advice and prices,
mute and obeisant before his statement,
kneeling for a daily blessing,

answering on printed postcards,
agreeable to our prostitution."
"I think you take such things too seriously.
Suppose now we are on the stage,
I see profusion, flowering trees,
painted water in the background;
if you sat there simply reading
people would laugh like the children watching you."
"At once you start exaggerating.
Why should I be on the stage?
Why should they laugh at me more than you ?
Can you never realise, I want to know
why the lettering is ugly, and the colour bad,
the woodwork moulded -- the allotment sun-scorched?
when they might found better type, use good colours,
metal for wood, and grow cool trees
to drop their sweetness, on the passing crowds ;
also, are these artists, even now,
to draw things finer for the public eye."
"Yes, but I like to think about you on the stage;
magnifying objects, as they are.
Sooner than have good posters
would I satirize these here,
drawing out humour with decaying teeth;
satisfy a curiosity :
I like the way the words can answer,
calling to each other from across the square,
they are noisy like crashing waves
crested with colour ;
some of them stand alone
like rocks, foam splashed,
with stunted trees shaking in the hoarse-voiced wind;
they are the islands in a tumbling sea
very much reminding me of Korin's waves."
Affection, unadulterate;
can't you see they make a world
with names alone as symbols ?
I suggested planting trees

to drop down sweetness on the dusty crowds,
but very soon the sight of trees will die,
and new advice for sunshades will usurp their space;
they'll write a name to summon to the mind
the smell of flowers, cool snow on the sun-soaked hills,
and in the place of wind a fan will turn
trying as a wounded bird to leave the ground
and hide in the clouds that now are lit
showing new pictures to a gaping world.
Such is the world they make; the buildings stand
roofless, waiting for a gang of slaves
driven with whips and torture to the task ;
I see them cringing on the lofty ladders
bowed with the load of bricks they carry;
up at the top they stop for breath,
and with a last heave tread the platform
dizzily looking down the cliff-steep wall.
Then the bricks are seized from them,
they scurry off,
and go down the ladder like a falling bird.
From a glass-less window a bald-head leans out,
tallying the windows with the avenues
that lead through arches of reflected light,
varying its splendour with the play of clouds
driven along high arches in the air
like chariots on the wide walls of a town;
till where the tunnels open to the sky
from the high windows you can see,
not flower beds, but the gaudy sails of flowers
dancing on a lake to the soft tune of wind
among the islands where the winds live,
buildings frail palaces among the trees,
with ladders down to the sunlit fields of sea
and spiral stairways to the terraces of cloud,
whose cool pavement they delight to tread
among the playing fountains of soft rain.
Then distant windows answer back with gold,
sounding an echo to the evening bells;
the bands are playing in the crowded parks ;
this half-built barracks has released its slaves.
In spite of the beauty of the evening air,


the crowd is ugly, and the band is bad,
but I decorated nature till it reached your pitch;
and our ultimate imaginings are much the same."
"My theatricals can mask the object,
making the surfaces of such things agreeable,
where, you, forget the ugliness, leave out the mar,
and so progress by leaps in place of strides;
I am fully conscious, but I want to change it,
where you can forget and force your mind
to spin fresh splendour out of the frayed silk.
What I mean by theatrically, when I ventured to suggest
the laughing you would cause and its reward to follow,
consists more of a forced exaggeration.
If everyone was quite as funny as you are
there would be no laughter, or a different standard
by which to judge the cardinal points of beauty.
Here is precisely the question of new values,
new standards of good and bad, new scales of beautiful and ugly.
For example:
You might be working all the summer at a seaside town;
playing twice nightly to a holiday crowd.
It would be a hot afternoon; you will drop your waistcoat,
light another cigarette, and leave your room.
It takes four minutes walking to the pier
down a public garden where the seats are full.
Picnics are over, and they feel too glutted
even to watch you, as you walk along.
Then there is a turnstile, and the sea comes out
barking at the pier-supports and lashing at the sand,
above it half a mile of planks and a shrill band.
This is better than the sights we see
sitting here, looking at the dusky hoardings.
To continue-perhaps it was too hot that afternoon,
but in the evening, at any rate, you have your chance,
then you can pretend to be just anything you like."
"If I say I'm Julius Caesar,
do you think they will believe me?
Can I convince myself from cockney,
and bad physique of the stage soldiers ?

If someone sneezes in the middle of my speech
everybody laughs and I forget my part."
"These, on the contrary, are just the times of stress,
strategic moments that decide the battle.
Someone sneezes. Parry to their feint.
Imitate them, show them that your sneeze is louder."
"But why have you got this mania for the stage?
I've never acted since I was at school.
It seems to me most foolish of all follies,
the greatest space and distance from reality.
Even you agree with me about the universal ugliness,
then you suggest the stage as remedy,
and think that I could cure it by sporadic acting."
"A travelling agapena, an earthly shrine on wheels
drawn round the country by high-stepping horses,
that is my notion of a death to dullness,
and if not with horses by a thundering motor
drumming its persistence on the giggling air.
Persistence, and I mean the everlasting life;
Wind in loose sails embodying their speed
suddenly set forth to cut the rolling waves,
like a swift-flowering meteor on a golden cord
held by loose line but growing to its fullness.
Can you imagine this swift-growing flower,
trained in position, but with impulse of a fountain
rocket-rushing to cool its gilded wing in clouds ?
This is the force by which its feet march
up the windows of the bare-white sky;
this, then, is the flower that shows as a meteor,
throws as a fountain, gleams as a rocket,
and this flower is the doomed continuance of life.
Giggling air, I said, and this will yield its secrets,
and whisper them behind the canvas wings,
softly breathe it as the voice of a prompter.
Has music never sounded in the evening wind
trickling disconsolately through the woods,
like a water-carrier working with a broken urn,
that you never knew the sacred power of laughter : -- 
broad grins watching from a red-brick wall,

on steady elbows while they watch the slaughterman
striking down the animals they eat next day;
and then an acid drop and then a well-known tune.
Drumming its persistence on the giggling air,
I said,
and, in fact, the rolling drums should rattle in the square
before a thick curtain that no eye can pierce,
and trumpets should sound out from all the square-set towers
to signal the triumphant hour when the sun is dead,
when the gardens are lit and little laughters ring
from wide-flung windows under the trees.
Persistence, I said -- I mean the giggling air,
rather I should say I mean the giggling drums,
or rolling drums: persistence -- and I mean the ..."
"... persistent air? ...".
"No, no; Persistence, and I mean the giggling air ;
I meant to talk about the everlasting life,
until you muddled me and made me stop!
Now I can go no further.....
I shall go home, and you can walk about !"
Ever so wearily they left their seat,
the shadow of the hoardings, the light of the town,
built gates and fences on all sides.
I went through a door that opened wide :
and X to a railing that he clambered over.
Now they walked among the mouldering tombs,
at back of the advertisements, behind the hoardings,
stumbling on the gibbets where the posters hung -- 
showed in a pool of light,
oozing from a crack through which he looked in passing.
The arena, sandless, dusty with light,
gaped there, grinning with its teeth, the lettering.
There he saw the circus for such fools to play in,
lit up, listening for their nonsense with quick ears,
and, when they had bled enough, were driven away.
Back through the darkness, till the streets began,
as far from r as ships can be at sea,
climbed stairs and lit his aureole of gas.


FIRST VARIATION ON A THEME
BY GEORGE PEELE

I WAS lying in the dappled shade,
I the lute hung lifeless in my lap,
When God stepped out of a moving cloud
to tread the tops of mulberry trees.
He hushed the trumpets, furled His flags,
and made His angels wave their wings;
thus was blown the pleasant wind
that wafted Him within my sight.
And when I saw Him through the leaves,
I knew He trod His winepress there;
the nectar sliding from the mountains
did not please Him like those berries.
I touched my strings, and God looked down ;
He smiled on me, and gave me wings,
but e'en His plumes had not the glow
the fire of fruit lit in the air.
All the while He kept His pace
and marched on in the whizzing wind.
I ran behind with feathered feet
and followed Him as best I could.
Had I gone quite far enough,
we should have reached to Black-man's land,
where ebon faces show out clear
against the brooks and crystal waves.

But dying daylight told the hour
and warned me I had best turn back.
I wept at parting, then I smiled,
and knew the purpose of these plumes.
For with their help I bridged the air;
I perched upon the silent sill,
and from this height my lute will sound,
and I shall catch the whispered call.


SECOND VARIATION
                                         
CAN a white wave its coolness keep
and break beneath the hot sun's stare;
will incense-trees for ever weep,
or do they too our changes share?
Flowers climb on the trees but once
to cloud those Heavens with their stars;
the fountains need a melting ounce,
a load of snow, to start their wars.
The blossoms and the leaping springs
ask for kindness ere they start;
an eagle grows strong with its wings,
and cannot prey without this part.
The wine lies in the grape until
a plucking hand can take its might;
barred is the window, mute the sill,
unless you climb to grasp the sight.
So, as I played my lute and sang,
I saw God in the mulberry trees.
His angels clapped their wings. There rang
a pleasant wind that bore the bees.
Still swifter to the flowers that flamed
and shone like lamps in deepest dark,
and all the unicorns we tamed
ran to cool themselves and hark.

For God was singing as He went,
pressing nectar for His drink,
and for the coolness that this lent
the beasts came thirsting to the brink.
But I ran up the ladder fast,
rattling the windows with my notes ;
and, as I played, a splendour passed,
and laughter on the wind still floats.


THIRD VARIATION

SO cool my spring, my waves so still
they lie, as dead, with glassy face,
breathe but on them to give me life;
and while this mirror keeps your breath
my foam is born, my leaves begin.
Run, shepherd, quicker than my fall,
and swim to cool me at my side,
for, now I live again, I burn.
You must quench me with cold fruit
or else I parch and fade again;
only give them into my hand
and I will grow you a golden tree.
But how will it help me, your golden tree?
I have no need of it for my lambs,
nor can I swim with it to the shore.
If I cut its timbers down,
and make a golden ship for myself,
lamb's wool will make a sail for me
and the winds of the air will give me speed.
The waters here aren't wide enough,
I need a space as void as the sky,
to tack in the wind and sail far out
or, like a cloud, stay still at anchor.
Be not cruel to lay me low,
and leave me burning at the water's brim.
I hidden lie among the boughs
till you try each perch to find me;
but, at each look, I drift like rain.
This is the promised tree. Its leaves,
its stem more flashing-bright than glass
are one, in growing from your fountain foot.

MRS. H. ...OR A LADY FROM BABEL

Dearest Child !"
Mrs. H. would float the words
As jewels from her sunshade,
Which to my infant eyes
Seemed as the fountain of all frankincense.
Beneath the twittering shadow
She leaned out, looking in one's eyes,
Her body perfectly enmeshed
Beneath the clinging scales of gold,
And all her landau
Filled with the falling jewels
The melting of the million bells
Set ringing when the wind breathes
And the blue spaces of the sky
Are filled with shaking leaves
Divine wisdom as a freehold gift
From black-gloved hands -- 
The feast of untold tongues !
On a bridge one evening
From behind the nearest house
The sunset air came suddenly alive with sound,
The throbbing from a mandoline fell forth
As the long lines of water when a boat floats by.
This ended, she was asked for coppers
In Italian.
"Coachman, drive on!


WEEK-ENDS
BLOW your long horn,
red cloud,
before the wide-thrown gates
and fresh-lit braziers of heaven ; -- 
to move the snowy mane
like mist above the plain,
and thus uncover
lawns like level seas,
and houses cool as trees
run round by balconies
that lead from house to house
and shew the sky against
a web of shivering leaves
struck through with gold.
The gardener must drop his fruit
and running down the ladder from the tree
must bow respectfully
to Mrs. ...
who walks into her Paradise
like a young deer playing in its park ; -- 
and I must enter as a friend
to watch her wise commandments -- 
"The roses must be sprayed,
and judging from the apples in your hand
a thousand wasps have dug there."
"Yes, M'um."
" Yes! I think so;
and the borders are not neat enough,
these stalks again are short enough,
why aren't they longer ?".
" Yes! M'um."
"Well then, you see,
I want the tree-tops trimmed,
and then at tennis

one can watch the steamers
through Lord Dodo's chimneys."
"Exactly."
" Yes! M'um."
"And growing in the beds,
embroidering the paths,
gazing in each other's eyes
wherever there is water
I've laid geraniums
like this one."
" I see."
" Yes! M'um."
" Hold it!"
"Yes! M'um."
"Whilst I show this gentleman
the way I've dug the lake
just lying where it nets the houses
and reflects them with their window-boxes."
"Fascinating."
" Yes! M'um."
"What do you think my husband
waits for in the train ?"
"Tell me!"
"M'um."
"Every yard the train comes
nearer to the station
he's thinking of the view;
steps on to the platform,
leaves the station,
turns the corner,
and it's there before him."
"M'um."
"A moment, m'um !
Miss Argentine was telling that her trees ..."
" You see it is no selfish pleasure,

not a private toy "
"May I speak a moment, m'um. ..."
" Others share the joy."
That moment there came
ringing through the leaves,
shaking the canopies
and falling from the branches like soft snow,
the voice of some one from a balcony:
Mrs. . . . was listening
to recognise the call
that deals a death-blow to each afternoon.
With but a brief farewell
this lady left us,
and all the while
we saw her white dress
glistening through the boughs,
and heard her footsteps
leave the lawn
to sound upon the gravel,
till she left a railing of gold spears between us;
while even then
we heard her answer
mocking questions lowered through the air.


Extract from " BIRD-ACTORS"
THAT splendid charlatan, Sebastian Mondor,
Sets up his quivering trestles,
Across the crowd they stretch
Their twisted arches, splendider
Than the slow palaces of air
That screen the sun's gold stare,
Or, when he moves in state,
With dropped wine, sweet exhalation
Smooth the gay arch he traverses.
Two feathers in their hair,
Comedians strut the sheer edge
Above the foaming crowd,
Loose sleeves and trousers flapping with the wind.
Through the crowd
The tremors of their movements run;
Till the furthest feel,
Dashed in their faces,
The fierce blossoms of each whistling parrot-cry.


TWO VARIATIONS ON THEMES OUT OF
ZARATHUSTRA

THE prophet from his desert cave
Listens to the sound of water
Lapping with tongues the fringes of the sand.
Young flowers open for the bees;
A roadway for the yellow sun
Climbs from the hills into the fallow sea.
The scented bells hold golden sound;
And the strong lion drinks the salted waves,
Cooling his mane within the sudden foam.
The bee skirts tremblingly the shining dew,
Looking for honey in the golden dells,
While the lion shakes the loud hills again.
This early morning there may lie some gold
Forgotten when the light was fled;
Today the great beams may shine
On opened caves where run swift rivers
Shooting their arrows at the swordless sea,
And blind to the sun whose shining armour
Shows in the sky among the clouds he charges,
Driving them across a wind-walled field
Into the shelter of the towering hills.
Honey may be hiding in the waking flowers,
The man in armour hides behind the gold,
The strongest waves, far off, are snow.
These are dangers to the daring robber,
The armoured impotence of man-made deity,
And crowd-thick, barking heads, on the lion-like sand,
Gathering honey in the rolling desert.
Such are the perils to a fasting prophet -- 
Dog-like men, and men-like gods.
Many doors lie open into his cave,
For lion-springs, flash of the surging sea,
And dogs that bark to bar him from his palm.

To leave his cave, and walk on the burning sand,
He passes the sun that bridles his yellow mane,
And the roaring crowd, an ocean of clashing waves.
Tight-rope dancers run over the roofs
And fall in the market-place -- 
Raising a laugh,
It looks like walking on the rainbow's bridge
Among the clouds, behind the windows;
There below fly the flags of smoke
Waving possession that the Lord's at home
And works, a creator, in his own fair garden
Where trees spring as fountains, lift into the air,
Their branches steadied in the height with wings
That quiver in the stream of wind,
And by the cold are frozen as they drop,
Before they foam again as fiery darts
Piercing the soft breasts of the pool,
They tremble above the water, bird-like, with flashing feathers.
Is Zarathustra armoured that he goes
Leaving his cave, down mountains,
Fording swift rivers, to attain the town?
The tight-rope dancers had turned back again
Waving their wands to balance a sharp curve,
They stagger as a child who learns his walk
Using a crutch in place of human hand,
Holding his own high above the head
To guide him on an easy, level path -- 
Guitars are played by men upon high stilts
Stepping over gardens to keep up the tune
Because the dancers only move with music.
With creaking leg and hollow tread
They walk among the houses, chase the rope,
And whisper warning while they play more loud.
Below, the cripples lean out from their corners,
And a dwarf or two will strain his little stride
To run like a child holding a strong kite.
This is the magnet drawing every eye
When Zarathustra comes behind the curtain of the gold horizon,
Walks into the town through the deserted gates.
Judges are holding back the wheel of time,
Fitting the spokes to figures on a watch

As they follow the competitors on airy paths.
He walks beneath an archway, hears his tread,
Multiplied and echoed in this empty hall,
And then is alone again on empty street.
Stepping out firm, he starts to sing,
Turns the corner and is in the square,
His song a loud river that now joins the sea.
Who will he first step up to,
Take by the shoulder,
To break down his stare?
Will he stoop down to a dwarf and shout,
Ask him to run across the square
And beg the Mayor to stop festivities a moment?
Is it too dangerous to hold a stilt,
Shouting out loud into the noisy air
To attract attention from a wooden giant?
If he holds a stilt and stops the music
Down will tumble all the tight-rope dancers,
And the men who play the mandolines cannot stand still.
Shout as loud as he possibly can,
He will never drown the music
And the roaring crowds.
One course, one only, is there to his hand;
Wonder and marvel are the joys to-day,
And this is the course that he must tread.
God goes on a cloud,
But the dancers walk there,
And the crowd shout louder than the singing of His angels.,
Thinking a moment, Zarathustra stopped,
Stroked his beard, and hesitated
Till his mind lit up;
Without a cry, without a word,
He started running down the square,
Raced ever quicker till he reached a wall.
No sooner touched it
Than he turned again,
Running ever faster than the way he came.
Reached the starting point,
Turned once more
Raising a dust to hide his face.
The men on stilts looked down like birds


Who watch for prey in the glistening grass,
And dropped the instruments from their hands;
The dancers when the music stopped
Swayed on their ropes
And fell like stars,
Flashed through the air with trailing sparks
And opened on the ground
Their clumsy petals.
The dwarfs and cripples raised themselves,
Came from their corners into dazzling sun
And ran among the crowd to start them running.
Soon Zarathustra showed in front.
Just behind were the men on stilts,
After them the able-bodied tan,
Followed by cripples and the bounding dwarfs ;
Half of them are running from right to left,
While Zarathustra showed from left to right.
Soon he caught the laggards and the limping halt
And ran among their crutches
By the jumping dwarfs.
This time, turning down a narrow street,
He ran into a house
And climbed the shaking stairs.
Out from the window on a roof he stepped
While the people ran up stairways
Like a flood inside a well;
Down a drain-pipe on the ground again
He heard the tumbling ceilings
And the roofs fall in.
While the survivors took the road again
Zarathustra ran out from a gate once more
Till he reached the burning sand,
And fell back breathless,
Blind from the dust
And dead with running.
Clouds of dust still rose from the town,
Blurred murmurs
And the tread of hundreds running.
"I won attention by my ruse.
Shouting was vain, and had I showed

Floating above them on a cloud
They would have guessed me lowered from a tower
Treading the yielding clouds like a man through snow
So I had to run among them like a wind;
But for all my running they have never seen
The stride of my footsteps,
But thought themselves
Each in each other to contain the cause.
My years of meditation in a cave
Gave more hope for another visit,
But now that they run themselves around the town
Nothing will stop them but themselves alone.
If someone with young lungs
Blew out through a trumpet the last chance for man,
It would be a feature in their entertainment.
I must look at the sun,
Who sinks to die
And pours his treasures to the sea to keep,
Guarding them with tempests and a change of tide.
So that in sinking to the sunless caves,
Where they lie to light the darkness till he comes again,
The poorest fisherman has golden oars
To row with over the echoing waves,
Suddenly shaking their yellow manes
To sound new music to the gods below;
And when the gold is taken from the oars
The music ceases and the waves are mute
Till a new wind whispers from the thirsty trees
And the fisherman can hoist his sail."


PARADE VIRTUES FOR A DYING
GLADIATOR
FOR safety, hear this, common mortals !
March with the others -- swing your arms -- 
don't step too fast-don't reach so far.
... Laggards are devoured by wolves :
if you but reach the enemy first
an eagle from the iron air.
will soar steep down, and peck your eyes.
Be the first to steal down fire,
and you shall lie on the aching rock, .
a threatening wing your roof and shade.
The scaffold stands and totters in the wind,
a cage for the light-a platform through the clouds :
remark-a scaffold and a scaffolding,
a terrace for death-and bars for young birds.
At the top he stoops to work,
the shadows give him longer limbs,
he strides on stilts to tie the ropes,
only string can hold the floors
and keep the telescopic roofs apart.
A little rubbing of dry hands,
snatches of sawdust on the floor,
then he nods for the fanfare like a God.
A screech of trumpets -- before we guess,
before we know what he stands there for,
the planks split up, they bend like rushes,
the frightened birds fly off, he tumbles,
falls through the brittle lights that snap
and give like waves when a meteor falls.
Now he crumples on the sand,
let him collect himself, spit blood and words.

They flood the arena-cover the sands -- 
The beaked war-boats raise their sails,
like birds they tack in the wind.
The second philosopher appeared,
proudly holding a ladder.
"Wait," he was saying, " till we're near enough,
then watch me making for another world."
He did not climb. He lined the deck,
the sailors helped him, charged with their ram,
the other ship was staggered, helpless.
They lay alongside, near enough,
over with the ladder, he climbed along.
His little weight decided things,
the two boats went apart, the hooks,
the claws of his ladder were wrenched out,
he lay like a man between wild horses.
One arm came off, and then a leg.
They picked him into a boat, rowed off,
drained out the water, and when the sand was dry,
there he lay close to the other,
the two philosophers together again.
The third put up a horn to his mouth.
"I deny," he roared, "a better world,
but I hope a stranger, not a nicer heaven.
Also your fault-and not my choice."
And then he disappointed the crowd,
fell, like a log, without one struggle,
killed by poison, drunk in secret.
"As my turn," the fourth man shouted,
" I'll walk on stilts through the drying water,
collect the bodies, carry them out,
and give them to the crowd for burial."
Then he began tremendous tests,
beat one stilt with an axe to break it,
looked through the eyeholes of his visor,
bared an arm to feel his sword.
Then on one leg his whole weight leaning,
he strapped his other leg to the stilt,





knocking it on to a wall to test it.
Both legs finished, he cannot stand,
he has to stamp and stagger around,
a tireless peripatetic.
They hand him helmet, sword, and trident,
and, last of all, the trumpet that he holloes down.
Now he is ready to start, steel clad,
and shod with hoofs of sounding wood.
He grips the trumpet with his teeth,
bares the trident, holds the net.
The first he comes to still is breathing.
He lances him with the trident, lifts him,
opens the net for the crumpled body.
The second man, legless, armless,
lies there helpless.
Little is left for the wide-tongued trident.
The man who drank the poison, died,
but still the venom lives within him.
He is spiked with the same three lances,
and the same points transfixing both,
killed the other who was breathing,
but being limbless could not move.
The weight of the two together stifled,
strained, and made this gladiator gasp -- 
to right himself, he must stand still,
he stumbled, drew to his height,
and fell.
Next we saw one stilt come out,
and wave above the shallow water.
He disengaged it, dropped it off,
the other leg was doubled up,
but he could sit knee deep in water,
and use the floating stilt as a crutch.
His trident stuck up out of the sand,
the visor and the trumpet still were his :
helmet for head, and tube for voice,
enough material for martial music.
The drums were rattling for his death,
but there he sat, and did not die.

He had the only pair of stilts,
and whilst the water ebbed from him,
leaving this monster on the sand,
he can string out platitudes,
and make a dying actor's speech.
"How do we differ from dull soldiers ? "
These were the words he started with.
"Where is the gulf for us to jump,
where are the stairs for me to climb,
so that I ride a horse, a cloud,
and rule the azure fields of air ?
Why do I want these; is it vain
to try and open gates of glass ?
They are transparent, is it vanity
that I wish for men to see me
ride beneath these gates, and glitter,
shine the other side from them?
Now they stand, where then I stood,
they see me where I nothing saw.
But when I came behind the glass,
the light to show me, dazzled me,
now I grope through a golden fog,
I stumble on the beams as stones,
I never see the road I walked :
lamps blind me; blatant shouting deafens me:
the more I stumble, more they cheer.
I suggest these virtues to all dying gladiators.
Never bury your rival's body, let their corpses taint the air,
do not put them in caves for the relic hunters,
but leave them to the vultures, they will quicken the decay.
This virtue I learnt, first, to-day.
Your enemies must feel both edges of the sword;
they shall be laggards for all hungry wolves;
and prey for the vultures if they die too soon :
this is why I build my house
using tombstones from damp fields,
that is why I said to-day
I'd gather the bodies and give them to you,

letting you dig and hide them for yourselves,
and keep you busy, fill your minds,
so that while I stand in the glare
you watch me not, but grope with your hands,
running the sand through greedy fingers.
Now I have light more prying than the sun,
no audience so nervous as the fainting stars
who gently withdraw, but watch behind the dark;
none are there, spying.
So you see I have gathered my rivals,
Given them over to you, occupied your attention,
now there is full light for me, and no rivalry,
alone I can work my wonders, alone in my own hours of day."
But then he worked his own greatest wonder,
his head dropped, knees sank, and he rolled into the water.
That is a virtue, but not a parade one:
Soldiers should run away to live another day.
Good as far as he went.
Good to gather and expose the corpses,
but weak of him to die, knee deep in water.
I should admire him more, sitting on his box
or washed ashore on a querulous hencoop.
This much I like, that he walked on stilts,
that the role he chose never let him stop,
that he could not stand, but must stamp ahead.
It seemed to me, if my turn should come,
that I would not take the sand, scour out,
and clear the threshold of the Statue dust;
any more than build with the dead, mute, stone;
that I would not snap the fallen swords,
or sharpen their points to help me,
neither slay the old, or build the new religion,
neither beg the streets, or live on an altar.
Parade these virtues, dying gladiators!
Beware of the final, finishing copestone.
Hang many masks from your belt,

but the last one awkwardly stops your disguise,
until you break the string, to take the bead -- 
And tumble the walls of your Paradise.
If you cage your growing trees,
no birds will float through them and sing;
if there are walls, you cannot watch
the fields that slope down till they hold the deep sea.
Between yourself and the waves there lie
all that divides and walls you in.
A Paradise is dangerous to hunt through.
for the rare tigers among the tropical trees;
if you had never attempted this,
you had never been lying wounded now.
An icy wind interrupted this flow,
a fall of stage snow fluttered from the roof.
We were aghast to see the gladiator
rolling the snow in his trembling hands -- 
Not to soothe him -- for the next scene was a fight on sledges -- 
but the gladiator finished several handfuls
and then he threw them into the audience.
It was a very irritating dust,
and broke in clouds, till everybody sneezed.
So I took my hat and coat and went,
letting them sneeze and seeing them weep -- 
and I turned this thought in my mind.
Surely the gladiator threw this snow
wanting their tears for two good reasons :
"First," said he, " I'll have them cry,
their tears shall flow for my timely death;
secondly, their tears shall hide and veil
until with smarting they cannot see :
and then they'll miss my proud successor."

DR. DONNE AND GARGANTUA
"Run and catch a falling star,
get with child a mandrake root." -- John Donne.
HALL arrow-root and Benger's food
furnish us fancies for our mood ?
The mandrake, and the witches' sabbath
may yield more fruitful aftermath.
Gargantua and Doctor Donne
swallowed their pills like other folk,
they laid a wager, neither won,
yet neither underwent the yoke.
Gargantua said he would contrive
to get a mandrake root with child.
Doctor Donne had said he'd strive
to snare a meteor, wet and wild.
And so they set out from the Alps
which showed more white than old men's scalps;
they shivered to their knees in snow,
and waited for the sign to blow.
Their view embraced all seas and lands,
the devil tempted them to leap,
if they relied on wings, not hands,
no longer should they stray like sheep;
they should go forth as eagles, keen
to blind the sunlight with swift sheen;
like lions they should walk abroad
till silence trembled when they roared.
Spurning this offer with just pride,
they opened maps and looked intent,
the way they chose was hot and dried,
without the ease that promise lent.
A bugle broke the stillness ;
ineffectual, and almost muted;
quickly shaking hands, they started
making down the mountain side;
first they walked together, later,
when they came upon a river,

Doctor Donne crossed over quicker,
leaving on the other bank
poor Gargantua the fatter,
slower walker of the pair.
Say good-bye to Doctor Donne,
I choose Gargantua protagonist
and lift my hero to the pedestal;
I shall wheel him on his car,
like a tiger he shall pass among the frightened trees,
the arms of waves shall hold him and shall move him,
he will be a sea-god dying on the waters;
I shall halt, and in the public square
he will be a totem to the kneeling crowd,
a faetus in a belly, a god upon an altar,
a mirror for perfection of the unborn race.
I shall shout something as follows : -- 
"I am not come with elephants,
nor can I cure you of disease;
but here is Gargantua, the giant,
the trumpet at God's lips
to blow my orders to the winds who run for me :
not only this, but a mirror
flatter than sea, less misty than the sky,
for the sun to hang over.
I like to think of him watching my friend,
to catch the weakness that he wears himself,
and mend his movements from Gargantua's style.
Soon, too soon, the other stars will burn
and forge sharp swords to kill the sun.
Pray to him until he falls in his armour,
and all the time know that my friend is important;
When the hot light is dead, then will your hour have come,
send him ambassador, ask for his help,
he will find out a means, and will direct your feet,
life will come back again, darkness will die.
Gargantua is here to-day
to get a mandrake root with child,
over the hills not far away
I want you to think of Doctor Donne
walking the world to net a falling star,


A fair wager, and I hope you'll help him.
To get a mandrake root with child
would solve the problem of your flesh;
If Gargantua succeeds
the sexual problem may be somehow settled ;
to-day I won't say more than this.
You must think for yourselves of the fresh delights;
but a word of warning;
remember, please, that my friend, Gargantua,
sings beneath a window when he can't find the stairs,
my advice is lock your doors
and send your daughters to their beds,
Gargantua is quick to seize them.
I will speak of Donne when he comes this way."
So I made Gargantua get up his speed.
He came quite quickly down to the plains,
but I lost him in crossing a little wood,
thinking too deeply of the words I'd say
in introduction to his keen campaign.
It seems Gargantua stole away
hid behind the trunks of trees,
crawled along the hollows.
I blew my bugle in vain
down the valleys,
getting more breathless till I touched a road,
where I stopped for a moment,
looking and breathing;
I pretended to be coughing
when some peasants passed.
As soon as they turned a bend
off I had gone again;
now that I thought it safe,
I bugled once more,
I blew like anything into the town
with the shrill welcome of my own fanfare.
But they were all asleep,
barred with shut windows,
and I drowned in the darkness,
was lost in obscurity,
fell down, fatigued, on the pavement and slept.

Fatal weakness, to let slip
the firm control I exercise,
for should I sleep, then should Gargantua
he only speaks when I'm away,
and only acts when I'm asleep.
I woke, and thought of Doctor Donne,
then of Gargantua with a shock,
realising it was still dark
and something had woken me from my dreams.
Gargantua left me in the wood,
he hid behind the trunks of trees,
crawled along the hollows
and lay behind the hedges while he heard my blasts -- 
Then, as the darkness fell,
into the town he walked, mocking me.
I suppose he mistook my obscurity,
never suspecting what there was to hide;
so he dropped his slow, wobbling gait,
walked briskly, swinging his arms,
straight through the town,
and, in the middle, he stopped to shout.
There was, immediately, a certain confusion,
people came pouring from the dancing halls;
and a mob surged round him,
trying to listen.
Then he remembered to be mystical,
and all of them grovelled on their knees together ;
but he carried things too far,
and spoke to them as only I can do.
It was just at this juncture that I stood up, stretched
and made my way to the noise I heard.
I was half minded what to do with him,
and, as I arrived, he had broached his mission.
The mandrake was too much for them,
I don't know why they thought it worse
than offering marriage to their daughters.
Trouble began,
the first stone flew across the air
and struck me,
then I half regretted being there.

We all started off in an instant,
I saw Gargantua far along a street,
open a door, and run inside the house
Unluckily for all concerned,
my hero made himself at home,
professed affection for the daughter,
locking her, and himself, upstairs.
Well, he must look after himself,
and I left him, jumped the wall, swam the ditch,
ran, right deep into a wood, and slept.
Next morning-how absurd it seems that I should share their
little day, -- 
I started off, at sunrise, for the West;
but not before I'd climbed a tree
and listened for Gargantua's voice
to crack the stillness and the earthen bowl.
In vain.
Doctor Donne we parted from across the stream,
and now we chase his feet along the bank.
For a time he saw Gargantua across the river
as he wobbled in and out among the trees and bridges.
I've lost the reins, we three are separate,
it often happens in such hilly country.
You can shift for yourselves, I confess myself,
I would sooner than not be out of your way.
I've made no speeches, told no fortunes,
but, as far as I can, I'll watch your feats.
Donne walked on till daylight fled
and thoughts of sleep came into his head,
while he watched the starry sky
till a sudden spark lit up his memory.
Walking the world to net a falling star -- 
and yet the gold he sought now found him sleeping.
He heard far voices, feared no danger,
and knew they were not plotting for his elixir.
The fruit they look for, hangs from trees
and drops, to lift an echo from the hollow mines
whose gold they wash in water, and subdue with fire

before they let it smile upon the sun.
"But mine," thought Donne, "shines out from the nets,
grows plumper, shielded from the worrying winds
that float like birds to peck my fruit;
and all the wires, the yielding scales,
the nets that give for growing, are of better gold.
If I could catch an apple as it falls away,
I should not need to dig and find my treasure."
This is Donne; you've heard Gargantua
preach his mission from my pulpit,
and I have sketched the speeches I've intended.
If Donne is precious, then Gargantua is prudish.
I left Gargantua locked in with the daughter,
and now we spy on Donne who counts the glittering stars.
He numbered more than the biggest lapful,
forgot his counting, and drifted into sleep:
not far away Gargantua slumbers,
fondling the girl he kidnapped, who enjoyed his violence.
All of them asleep, and so was I.
How did Gargantua escape disaster?
Waking in the morning, much refreshed and young,
Gargantua's stratagems took shape again.
" You are my daughter, and my wife, in one;
I shall tell the people of my God-like find.
The child of your parents with an added grace,
my holy paternity is also yours :
if their conception, it was my idea.
You shall be my priestess; they shall pray to you.
And all the while beneath this cloak,
I can come back again, a ball of lightning,
and sleep away the pleasure of our holy meeting."
Then he unlocked the door, and spoke outside.
Of course, in a moment they were at his mercy,
grovelling and praying all along the street.
The father and the mother were the first to greet him,
and when he claimed their daughter, they at once agreed.
"I shall leave your daughter, till I call for her,"
and then he smiled on her, and shook hands with them both.
What can I do to pay Gargantua,
make him suffer for his boldness ?

He ran downstairs, unbarred the door,
bowed to the window, waved farewell.
" Remember the mandrake; what I told you,
problems it may help to settle.
I propose we leave your daughters,
let your sons crusade with me."
At his words the young men started,
met outside the city walls;
bugles rang, sharp wind through leaves,
the golden stars were gathered in the fields,
they lay among the lawns and blessed the stillness,
their mothers and their sisters bore the helmets, felt the
plumes.
It touched me, and I nearly choked,
felt I could cry to see them all;
any hint they act upon.
But Gargantua led them out,
they worshipped him, forgetting me.
A blast of a bugle, and they rose,
took their helmets, shook the plumes,
stood up in their glittering armour.
In front of them Gargantua rode,
the apex of this arrow-head,
the sharp beak of this hovering eagle
that lingered over the far-flung plain.
A river of stars to leap the rocks
and net the hills with their wingless foam;
in front of them Gargantua rode
tempting a meteor with his lance
to drop on them and join its heat,
sift it through the burning grain,
to lie there for the waves to break
and cool that mane of yellow sand.
A lance that challenged topmost stars
stood, the pinnacle, of this temple -- 
Gargantua was helping Donne
but why he started on crusade
except to help his own adventure,
none of us knew, except Gargantua.
Mine was now a queer position,

Doctor Donne was out of sight
and Gargantua usurping
the privilege I take from men.
Out of sight; but Donne could see
the meteor dancing in cold space
above Gargantua's boastful head.
He saw it and he started off
and ran to bask beneath its light.
Dimly through leaves and down the shadowy valleys running,
climbing to clear hilltops for a sight of dripping fire,
not throwing like the tongue of fountains
softening the ice-bound air
but falling out of space and time,
Donne could see his meteor, drop,
plunge, try to pull back with ribbed wings,
but fall faster,
drop its control of speed,
run through the winds, but not waver from their force,
or stagger from their flow of rivers,
blow forth the cloud as chaff
from his fire breath of speed,
then Donne looked for Gargantua's fusion,
looked, listened, and waited long,
and when his breath had come, went on again.

A MARCH PAST AT THE PYRAMIDS

THE door grates open. Two wild eyes look out.
Reconnaissance. Until a readjustment
of feathers, clothes, and gloves
has made her ready for the street fighting.
Make way, malicious children!
Stand back, until she finishes the steps
And moves along the molten asphalt.
Throw down those cones of light
which clothe a wall or tower!
Stand free from them, strong buildings!
As if the coat of shadows that you wear
had fallen to your feet;
and with this gold reserve
run down a gurgling river
past the regimental flowers
and close-cropped lawns,
as far as where the flower beds
and the pathways merge their stiff geometry
into a simplified horizon.
The hundred-handed trees
now wave their flags against her face,
and she is sailing down the stream
through every adverse current,
and past the threatening shoals
of unknown residents.
The carriages across the square
will run you down the steepest roads
and, for a slightly higher fare,
will take you where no rust corrodes;

along the breathless streets, that is,
where deathless dowagers sustain
the shadow of high life in Paris,
and, in attempting it, constrain
to leash wild Nature to their funeral car,
and make the gay clouds float like kites,
and wire the tall trees, bright as stars,
for buttonholes, at awful rites.
Then why is it, that You must walk ?
I see you, in imagination,
drawn on the terraces where talk
the shades who left us with elation,
and, leaning on the carriage side,
giants and dwarfs will point and shew
the lakes on which the satyrs ride
and hold the sails the zephyrs blow.
For in shy boats that float like birds
the satyrs once again set out
to find the fleece of golden herds
now feeding in the woods to flout.
New argonauts -- who now, at last,
can see the trees, between the sails
that hang upon their golden mast;
the trees that gleam like golden rails
are throwing the ripe fruit, down, down,
till, from their skiffs, the satyrs hear
the apples falling on the town
below the clouds, as fleeces clear.
The fountains with their crystal whips
are thrashing the teetotum dust
on which the glistening branches of the trees
drop down a coolness as she passes.
The simplified horizon is a fixture,
it does not run before her
like a hunted animal;
it does not leap down from the hills

and hide in the fierce green leaves
whose lapping tongues
drink in the rain of golden fire;
nor swim among the waves
that spread their tails,
shake forth their whirring wings
and try to imitate the battlemented clouds
running against the trumpet-throated wind.
Your mind is evidently set
to reach the daily goal,
the path's end,
where you turn again
and walk back home for lunch.
So, while you chase this mean horizon
of blank wall, I'll follow
in your wake-a second shadow,
with more evident intention.
In this net of changing paths
and different views,
giant figures loom like pointsmen in a fog
setting the lines,
directing the different phases
and future happenings.
While loud voices speak.
The man who built the pyramids
discussing them with William Blake
confessed the secrets of his Art,
and shewed them, once for all, as fakes.
The light wind drifting down the road
upon the scarce heard noises of the town
breathes just as cool upon the woods and hills.
It rests a little in the shimmering trees,
then, while the dying sun unclasps his hair
over the fresh fields and the gilded sea,
it plays with the swaying cornland
through those gold moving pillars

under the falling fountains of ripe fruit,
till the clear evening falls upon us all.
A natural clumsiness had always been
my bar to progress
until I conquered it by calculation.
I made a poor Narcissus
when I pored into the river,
but in its smooth black mirror
I watched the meteor acrobats
whose shining wings and fiery hair
illumined the insensate air,
and in the straight lines of their flight
among the archipelagos
that glitter like a golden rose,
I saw the roads that never meet
and on them those that never talk
although together on their walk.
My natural clumsiness could not prevent
more abstract knowledge, and an obvious bent
for things that carry motion to a pitch
where only calculation, with its stitch
of make-believe, and taking things for granted,
completes the web, and leaves the answer planted
as strong as any fir tree hung with combs
to drop like bombshells at whoever comes.
My knowledge can hang nets to catch
the flaming sparks that set the thatch
alight above the floating towers,
trembling to whiteness under bowers
lit suddenly, and changed to gold,
when the sun awakes and calls his fold.
And when like gleaming jewels they lie
and fill the webs with coloured sky,
I hold some in my hand like fruit,
and point to them and shew their suit

fiery with splendour and the green
lawns on which the proud birds preen
feathers more gorgeous in their glow.
But leagues above the cooling flow
and running rivulets of wind,
spanning the clouds, one foot behind
resting upon the giant hills
down which the sunlight runs its rills,
the ideal pyramid will raise
its pinnacle too proud for praise,
that, like a diamond, writes a name
across the skies, and gives me fame.
And so, while smaller men may make
the soft singing and the golden shake
with which the ripe fields greet the sun,
into the joys for which they run
tired lives into a broken mould,
and then renounce the joy and fold
crippled limbs, rehearsing in their mind,
sights to remember when quick eyes go blind;
I can reach above the crowd
without a mask, without a shroud,
and watch them counting grains of sand
to tell the height my buildings stand.
I was the man who ran along
a valley at the planet's song
and guided by the golden chain
that shone above a little plain,
I reached the folds in which there slept
the silent lambs the king had kept
playing in the whispering air,
until he cut their woollen hair.
Chosen as the delegate
to represent our native race,
I travelled in a caravan
crossing hills unknown to man
until the song died, high in air,
which told us that our end was there.
I was the wise man of the South
and sang before the dragon's mouth
his all inevitable doom :
and now, outside a wretched room
fiery turbans paint the air
and Babel tongues are loosened, where
three running streams of races meet
and lay their offerings at his feet.
Waving palm leaves toss the air
in heavy spades full, falling where,
like steam-engines, cathedrals rise
to ring their bells within the skies.
Now who must take the precedence
among the triple race of man
collected at this mere pretence
to show the seeds of providence ?
An African, from Mozambique,
is ready at my right-hand side.
Will he defeat the Jewish clique
and reach there first, in righteous pride?
On a platform in the square
the local band confronts the air ;
playing together, till they sound
a note which sends the signal round.
Spontaneous gifts of homage, soon
flooded the house and filled the road;
late-comers never knew the boon
of bettered days, but bore the load
unpaid and prayerless through their lives ;
wild honey, not yet in the hives,
shall comfort those who cry alone;
their bed the sand, their food a stone.


"Bow down !" his guardians say. "Bow down!"
their threatening wings shut in the town;
one human tribe obeys the call;
two others run beyond the wall.
Priority it is that counts,
however high your incense mounts.
At night the weeping stars combine
to let their golden isles outshine
the waving fire before his throne.
The springing flames obscure the groan
of countless multitudes who pray
to painted birds, or beasts of prey.
At the vast inspiring sound
to which the tyrant god is crowned
while the distant valleys hear
the feet of those who run in fear;
the anchorites who fill the caves
and feed with satyrs, sing aloud;
they step into the surging waves
and float to Heaven in the cloud.
The fountains with their crystal whips
are thrashing the teetotum dust;
Mrs. X is walking in the crowd ;
Mrs. Y is still outside the scrum.
Now is the daily tournament at hand
to prove the shouted statements of geometry.
The two come nearer ;
will they touch, or bow;
or just fade back into infinity?
They are the actors in this drama;
blind are the crowd ;
tamed Nature is an audience.
Mrs. X is ready with a smile
and spreads a feathered dignity around her;

Mrs. Y detests the common grass,
the sun-scorched railings, and the folding chairs.
And so they pass, and never bow,
and Mrs. X folds up her trembling wings,
to walk back sadly through the fading day
To show what might have been
to failing eyes;
gold towers are building far above the sea,
and many suns are dangling in the trellises ;
while little waves run in
and shake their cooling snow
against the shadeless sand.
The windows in the gilded towers
have generous trees to shade them;
from their branches
float down singing birds
to lie asleep upon the sills
like ready instruments
whose strings you pluck
when, through the dappled air,
down in the jewelled orchards,
where ripe tumbling fruit
and shimmering dew
are dancing to the silver sound
the Man who built the Pyramids
advances, leading on each arm
one of the changeless parallels
that grace the cylinders of History.

THE NEPTUNE HOTEL
ARCHITECTURE, flowers' device
of tricks to play upon the sun,
building frail palaces that tempt him
filled with potentates for him to tumble,
playing with his image in the shrine.
A device of flowers to draw him down
and make him walk their golden roofs,
shaking thin walls with force of his fiery wind,
and when he goes in at the palaces
to scatter the pollen for his wind to carry.
Here are houses built above the fields
quite near to gardens of such growing strength
their harvest wrestles with the wandering wind,
but I stand to talk of the houses that lie
and shine like lilies in the gentle foam.
Here is the Inn of the sea-god Neptune,
these are the walls he allows to stand,
wide flung windows answer to the waters
yielding a horizon at the ocean's edge;
the edge of the world lies easy there.
You need not climb the haughty hills
to gaze across the emptiness that lies beyond;
from every floor, through each bright window
the bar of horizon shows along the sea,
proudest garden wall of any secret God.
Step out carefully, the dazzling lights
are manifold messages from unseen stars
piercing the ocean as it flows away
to wash bleached sands on untrod shores
quite near to gardens of the growing stars,
where they reach to fullness, plump their gilt
and when the blossoms are about to open
leaving the soft beds of conception

laid under arches of cool-shielding trees
to shadow the loving limbs that gendered them,
they spread full flowers against the azure night,
and some of them are messengers who run across
the high blue hills an hour before the new-born day,
others shine still like loud birds in trees,
or fish with gold lines in the wavering sea.
Over the water full domes float high,
their airy bubbles moored by the wind
to gleam with wine dropped from his cups
by the giant who feasts in a spotless Heaven
and loads us with light.
His beams dart down and stab the waters,
he walks on lattices across the waves,
I see them out in the farthest ocean
dry their manes; I hear the tritons
gathering over the liquid plain.
They sound their conches; some come swimming,
they gurgle and they leave a wake,
and when the snowy foam is melted
out of the depths with a bound there comes
one who left his mine of jewels,
and rolled his stones to a shining heap,
there are no robbers in his world,
as in our world, there are no woods,
no centaurs watching out of their caves
who breathe a sharp wind from the cliffs.
But even now, not long ago
our sails were flapping in an island's shade
and I heard the centaurs under the hills
trying the pipes of the wind-wrecked sailors
till a wind more feeble than their fluting came.
We have no grapes for the satyr's fist
to pluck from the vines and stain his skin,

no wide fields to run over and carry
a stolen girl to the waterpools
where they sleep in the flickering shade;
conches are the pipes of Venice,
our forests are the moving waves,
they are the woods, the lakes, the fields,
the vineyards trellised from stout trees
over the running gold of the sea.
There lie the fields where the tritons gather,
they sing in the shade and they dance together,
a breath of wind, and the shivering waves
are fountains under the trees
and a waterfall down the hot lawns.
Here is the Inn of the sea-god Neptune,
here are the walls he allows to stand,
the windows open on the vineyards,
fruit of the waves, itself in water,
cool for the thirsty, lies at your hand.
The lips of night and the strings are silent,
the sleeping sun is alive again,
he walks on lattices over the waves,
the tritons lay the bridge for him
and work to the sound of their haughty conches.
Over the islands he rests a moment
to drop the seeds that reach to flowers,
if the sea birds will but carry them,
the fields of snow will sing with lilies
and the sharp blue hills be robed in fire.
Now like a sailor against the canvas
he shows in the ropes and the latticed web,
the clouds, like birds from hot lands, are around him,
he opens the cage that they travel in
and they spread their wings through the air.

They feel the wind with their sails
and they flash keen wings in its breath,
then, as he calls them
singing, they fill utter space
and the bars that imprison them, echo their song.
Now the sun is right on us,
he stands and he raises his spear,
while he hovers to bless us
the towers, those tubes of loud music,
loosen their tongues.
The wind runs fresh to their lips
and they tremble with force of their song
through stems that now shake with their flowers
from the utmost petal in air
to the lake that they float on.
Iron tongues that talk as a hammer
are loosed and speak from the air,
the molten morning is ordered,
its metal runs to the word
and silence is born to loud bells.
The tubes are hushed, those bells are mute,
they close loud lips, they bow their heads,
the coming of the new-born light
is seen in silence, over the waves
that live and die, and are live again.`
For they raise their crests and their eyes are fire
till they fall like snow with the wind,
but once more they shake proud plumes in the air,
and rising again through the clouds
the towers are tubes of solemn music.
Blown by the wind and strung with bells,
live from cool lips and hung with flowers,
the breath of living is free within them,
rays of sun, warm fingers, will pluck them,
and the stops of their song will be touched once more.

My windows showed the islands
striding on stilts through the sea,
they called to one another with their bells
and the foam sang low beneath the windows.
I looked for gardens and the cool of trees,
but I knew that the scent came out at night
not from such, but from the leaves of stars
and the whirling cataracts of fire-like water.
I see light on far roofs, a sheaf of arrows,
the barbs have stuck, but the plumes still quiver,
they hold to their points but shake their crests,
those birds on lawns that the dew conceals.
More arrows fall out of a cloud,
and as the waves draw from the sand,
lion bodies grow lithe and are strong
and the waves draw back from their might.
Our hours are as shells upon the sand,
they sing for the waves to wash them with snow;
our fields of sand are yellow as the corn,
their lips as thirsty for the melting cloud,
and the waves will run up to them,
sing at our windows,
drop their snow before the growing islands.
God must be dead who walked upon the waters
and made men wonder at His march ; -- 
A new way among cities, an end to the gods
that men may inhabit a harder world,
but keep the gods living to mock at them,
laugh at their idleness waiting a prayer.
A harder world without a God to catch us
when we drop from a scaffolding, fall from our web
and cannot spin a rope of silk
up which to clamber to the clouds again.
But the gods stand still like a statue in a garden,
and our laughter is heard, while they smile and are dumb,
Sooner than pray, we will grant our prayers
and give to ourselves the gifts we ask.

I will sound a trumpet over the plains of sea
to light the torches for the evening feast,
the fruit that dangles through the clouds will shine
and be our galaxy of shimmering lights.
In boats that hover like a bird they come
and climb to the terraces that feel the wind;
some have lived over the sea on white wings
cool and high as the cliffs,
and they feel as free again above the waves.
Before the morning comes to us again
we can build through the darkness.
Myself, if I could pave the lakes,
I'd run their waters past my walls,
sloping the valley for their running feet
to send them faster till they gather strength
to climb the paths I've laid for them.
They shall run down to gather strength
and the flight of their speed shall carry them up;
the boats shall set their sails with the current,
they shall tremble with the eagerness of all the waters;
as they strain and make their race,
the sun shall come out walking on the waves,
his feet shall climb the mighty stairs
and pass them, treading with majestic speed;
he shall be the first to reach
that terrace where the city stands,
before the waves and the clattering ships
stand still in the harbour.
Are we not proud to make the sun
climb to us bowing with his beams
to reach our height and stay an instant
before he climbs his secret tower?
The ships now furl their sails
gliding to the busy quays,
but the waves run on to the shore and sound
as loud as bells that ring in the trees,
or whirl their song through clouds
that move with the wind and are light as leaves.

The walking of the men across the bridges, down the alleys,
has not the march of soldiers, or the feet of dancers,
but is the roll of waters, the balanced tread of sailors,
who cross the shaking hills of sea under every wind and sky.
Now at this time to mock the falls,
the fountains and the singing birds
that make soft beds for love in the gardens on the land,
voices run out of the boats and sing
on the laughing water under the windows.
The lutes are like fat hulls of ships,
their rigging and the shrouds are strings,
they are quite easy to the sailors,
but to the minds behind the windows
these lutes are as the fruit on trees,
the shaking strings are the leaves that hide
and draw the hand behind their shade
to feel the hidden bounty;
and if this fruit was in their nets
to pay the players they would part the meshes,
let the tired hands touch and feel
those hills of snow they hide with love.
They'd slake their thirst and sing again,
although they cannot reach the fruit
their songs like birds can hover there
and peck it when the wind will help,
lifting the leaves, while making louder
each fall of song to drown the flutter
of hovering wings that linger to steal.
Then, when a curtain lifts, there drops
a ladder of light to the shadowed water
and time and space are born to climb;
there is a moment to cross the sill
and lift the nets and take the fruit.
Thus was the cool night tempered with fire;
the tritons woke again and felt the wind,
they watched most tensely how it shook and played
running among the glittering leaves of spray
till they knew the strength that the clouds must fight
setting their sails to profit by the force,
and now they waited for the sun to come;


the hour of cockcrow blared through the fields,
the shadows rose at the creaking call
and left their task like workers in the dusk.
This crowing through fierce trumpets
rang more often from each valley,
was a beacon on each hill and a spear before each door;
heavy curtains fluttered with no wind,
the stones upon the mountains creaked like tombs.
Silence lay upon the plains till a spark
flickered through the darkness, and a trumpet rang
answering the far sound dwarfed by distance.
Then with his plumes more brilliant than the birds
the crest of the sun showed under the plain
as he climbed from the worlds where he strutted through our night
and the fanfare rang still louder from the hills.
His crest and then his comb came out,
feeling the chill air like any fowl
he creeps out from his barn into the cold:
He lifts his fiery feathers and the stars die out.
I built through the night and now I frame the day,
and make a Paradise for all the hours.
The waves are woken like the sleeping fields
by cockcrow voices loud and urgent,
giving out shrill orders on the serenading wind :
the flags upon the masts rap out commands.
We will send out ships upon the molten sea,
to cut through the foam and charge into the clouds;
the sailors in the rigging will be wet with mist,
and the wind stand still like eagles in the air.
The people must be servile, must obey like sailors,
clanking and hoarse are the cranes from much work.
At the sound and sight of coming plenty
the changing currents of the air will sing;
such are the scenes I focus on the wind.
It shall be a beauty that cannot be collected.
Turn up the lights and open wide the shutters,
this shall be a beauty never seen in brothels !
The power of wine, the fire of Dionysus

kindling a flame through the black woods of night
shall wear its garlands in deserted roads;
the statue in the garden shall be dyed with that blood.
The shapes that stagger through their bones will shake
and drop their wisdom like the Indian trees
that sleep in the sun and at night are fountains
melting to spice the metal of their flame:
now they can enter the bright lit houses
armed with guile to silence laughter.
Here are gathered the shuttered beams,
the lines of light that break before they shine :
these are the parasites among the trees
with brighter leaves to give the birds their life,
gilding the robbery with stolen fire.
At the first sign of surrender,
first longing for soft couches and mild air
with little waves to play with like soft lambs;
leaping lions shall be loosed
to fall like fire down the fields
and run among the houses and quiet gardens;
as soon as the ships lie still on the sea
and the sailors land and walk the islands,
bathe in a lake and lie beneath the trees,
start their twanging music,
their boats will prance like horses in a field,
and the wind shall sound the trumpets of battle.
The trumpet drifted down the woods,
it rattled only the youngest leaves,
then it swam through the sea and creaked among our towers.
Ring sea-halls with loud music,
load your shells with the echo of the waves,
at the sound of this horn
the tritons shudder,
and windows tremble in the water castles.
The genius comes like a cloud from the distance,
a sudden growing in the fields of space,
the meteor burns
and the stars are blind,
the net of numbers holds but one.

They drag the sea and feel the void,
but it comes of itself
and is not found;
the fire will burn without a flame,
the waters flow without a source.
The water and the fire will melt
and make a lodestar in the air,
a floating island,
driven clouds,
all space contracted to one tower.
The tritons breathe again and bring
their tribute over the snow-bound hills;
they reach the calm
and leave the foam
gliding swiftly, proud and eager.
Domes rise out of the waves, they gleam
and show smooth limbs and shining hair
with music sounding out of their throats :
swim nearer, tritons, see the quays
and climb the steps to the floating islands.
They clamber up the steps and crawl,
slipping on the rain-smoothed marble,
one of them drops his pearls,
they shine
the spray of fountains falling through the sun.
They had their audience and were fed,
calling hoarsely
one to another,
at night each laid his conch aside
and slept half into the fountain's brim.
This was the tribute of the sea, but now
the sailors open cages from hot lands.
Out fly the birds
and sing to the sun,
they fill the clouds and echo in the rain.


The clouds can wander among the hills,
they lose themselves like light in a forest :
they sing bird-songs to the sun,
his winds
will hurry them forth, and drive them home.
To the sun, his clouds are soft as birds,
their voices cooler than the waterfalls ;
they give him shade
and speak his word,
they shield him with their painted sails.
They fly to us, their crests as turbans
with liquid tongues that babble water,
their wings are leaves,
their words clear springs :
they bring these gifts from an anchored world.
This is a town that floats, no woods
can cool us with their waving shade,
but the birds that cling
to a gliding ship
can flash in the sun and sing to us.
Our domes and towers are sails or smoke,
we float while other stars are still,
they sing their homage
in our wake,
and follow through the melted waves.
The waters are more smooth than lawns,
they have a drifting dappled shade;
the web of shadow
lifts and falls,
it flashes and it fills the net.
The daring few who cross the fields
are meshed and snared by the laughing leaves,
the clouds and waves
will hide and drown,
the net will drag their corpses in.

The bodies are renewed by fire
that tempers them and burns them clean,
the breath of speech
swells in their lungs,
they live again and laud the flame.
A choir of tritons floats between
the city and the sloping plain,
they hear the sailors
sing from their ships
and hush their horns to hear the praise.
Now are built the bridges
to walk firmly to the future.
No longer shall they trust themselves
to the fickle sea that changes with its moods,
or hang reliance on the wind
till the hand of an enemy takes the reins.
More swift than men on horses
they shall be the shepherds
to the flocks of cloud and the folds of sea,
to send them out to pasture, and to fence them in.
I see them open the watergates
till a gentle rain comes down from its forest
to play among the lawns and fields.
Unstop the towers again, sound forth
their music down the whirring wind !
It shall run apace and reach us
where we lie with idle sails.
In the sudden foam there breathes
a coolness that gives life again,
the city shows above the sea,
increases from its couch of snows
until the domes, like flowers, break out,
the fire of music fostered them
and raised them in the fields of sea.

WEATHERS

               

   THIS is the weather the cuckoo likes,
      And so do I;
   When showers betumble the chestnut spikes,
      And nestlings fly:
   And the little brown nightingale bills his best,
   And they sit outside at "The Travellers' Rest,"
   And maids come forth sprig-muslin drest,
   And citizens dream of the south and west,
      And so do I.

                               

   This is the weather the shepherd shuns,
      And so do I;
   When beeches drip in browns and duns,
      And thresh, and ply;
   And hill-hid tides throb, throe on throe,
   And meadow rivulets overflow,
   And drops on gate-bars hang in a row,
   And rooks in families homeward go,
      And so do I.




THE MAID OF KEINTON MANDEVILLE
(A TRIBUTE TO SIR H. BISHOP)


   I HEAR that maiden still
   Of Keinton Mandeville
   Singing, in flights that played
   As wind-wafts through us all,
   Till they made our mood a thrall
   To their aery rise and fall,
      "Should he upbraid."

   Rose-necked, in sky-gray gown,
   From a stage in Stower Town
   Did she sing, and singing smile
   As she blent that dexterous voice
   With the ditty of her choice,
   And banished our annoys
      Thereawhile.

   One with such song had power
   To wing the heaviest hour
   Of him who housed with her.
   Who did I never knew
   When her spoused estate ondrew,
   And her warble flung its woo
      In his ear.

   Ah, she's a beldame now,
   Time-trenched on cheek and brow,
   Whom I once heard as a maid
   From Keinton Mandeville
   Of matchless scope and skill
   Sing, with smile and swell and trill,
      "Should he upbraid!"




SUMMER SCHEMES


   WHEN friendly summer calls again,
         Calls again
   Her little fifers to these hills,
   We'll go -- we two -- to that arched fane
   Of leafage where they prime their bills
   Before they start to flood the plain
   With quavers, minims, shakes, and trills.
      " -- We'll go," I sing; but who shall say
      What may not chance before that day!

   And we shall see the waters spring,
         Waters spring
   From chinks the scrubby copses crown;
   And we shall trace their oncreeping
   To where the cascade tumbles down
   And sends the bobbing growths aswing,
   And ferns not quite but almost drown.
      " -- We shall," I say; but who may sing
      Of what another moon will bring!




EPEISODIA


                 

   PAST the hills that peep
   Where the leaze is smiling,
   On and on beguiling
   Crisply-cropping sheep;
   Under boughs of brushwood
   Linking tree and tree
   In a shade of lushwood,
      There caressed we!

                               

   Hemmed by city walls
   That outshut the sunlight,
   In a foggy dun light,
   Where the footstep falls
   With a pit-pat wearisome
   In its cadency
   On the flagstones drearisome
      There pressed we!

                              

   Where in wild-winged crowds
   Blown birds show their whiteness
   Up against the lightness
   Of the clammy clouds;
   By the random river
   Pushing to the sea,
   Under bents that quiver
      There rest we.




FAINTHEART IN A RAILWAY TRAIN


   AT nine in the morning there passed a church,
   At ten there passed me by the sea,
   At twelve a town of smoke and smirch,
   At two a forest of oak and birch,
      And then, on a platform, she:

   A radiant stranger, who saw not me.
   I queried, "Get out to her do I dare?"
   But I kept my seat in my search for a plea,
   And the wheels moved on. O could it but be
      That I had alighted there!




AT MOONRISE AND ONWARDS


         I THOUGHT you a fire
      On Heron-Plantation Hill,
   Dealing out mischief the most dire
      To the chattels of men of hire
         There in their vill.

         But by and by
      You turned a yellow-green,
   Like a large glow-worm in the sky;
      And then I could descry
         Your mood and mien.

         How well I know
      Your furtive feminine shape!
   As if reluctantly you show
      You nude of cloud, and but by favour throw
         Aside its drape . . .

         -- How many a year
      Have you kept pace with me,
   Wan Woman of the waste up there,
      Behind a hedge, or the bare
         Bough of a tree!

         No novelty are you,
      O Lady of all my time,
   Veering unbid into my view
      Whether I near Death's mew,
         Or Life's top cyme!




THE GARDEN SEAT


   ITS former green is blue and thin,
   And its once firm legs sink in and in;
   Soon it will break down unaware,
   Soon it will break down unaware.

   At night when reddest flowers are black
   Those who once sat thereon come back;
   Quite a row of them sitting there,
   Quite a row of them sitting there.

   With them the seat does not break down,
   Nor winter freeze them, nor floods drown,
   For they are as light as upper air,
   They are as light as upper air!




BARTH L MON AT VAUXHALL


Fran ois Hippolite Barth l mon, first-fiddler at Vauxhall Gardens,
composed what was probably the most popular morning hymn-tune ever
written.  It was formerly sung, full-voiced, every Sunday in most
churches, to Bishop Ken's words, but is now seldom heard.

   HE said: "Awake my soul, and with the sun," . . .
   And paused upon the bridge, his eyes due east,
   Where was emerging like a full-robed priest
   The irradiate globe that vouched the dark as done.

   It lit his face -- the weary face of one
   Who in the adjacent gardens charged his string,
   Nightly, with many a tuneful tender thing,
   Till stars were weak, and dancing hours outrun.

   And then were threads of matin music spun
   In trial tones as he pursued his way:
   "This is a morn," he murmured, "well begun:
   This strain to Ken will count when I am clay!"

   And count it did; till, caught by echoing lyres,
   It spread to galleried naves and mighty quires.




"I SOMETIMES THINK"
(FOR F. E. H.)


   I SOMETIMES think as here I sit
      Of things I have done,
   Which seemed in doing not unfit
      To face the sun:
   Yet never a soul has paused a whit
      On such -- not one.

   There was that eager strenuous press
      To sow good seed;
   There was that saving from distress
      In the nick of need;
   There were those words in the wilderness:
      Who cared to heed?

   Yet can this be full true, or no?
      For one did care,
   And, spiriting into my house, to, fro,
      Like wind on the stair,
   Cares still, heeds all, and will, even though
      I may despair.




JEZREEL
ON ITS SEIZURE BY THE ENGLISH UNDER ALLENBY, SEPTEMBER 1918


   DID they catch as it were in a Vision at shut of the day -- 
   When their cavalry smote through the ancient Esdraelon Plain,
   And they crossed where the Tishbite stood forth in his enemy's way -- 
   His gaunt mournful Shade as he bade the King haste off amain?

   On war-men at this end of time -- even on Englishmen's eyes -- 
   Who slay with their arms of new might in that long-ago place,
   Flashed he who drove furiously? . . . Ah, did the phantom arise
   Of that queen, of that proud Tyrian woman who painted her face?

   Faintly marked they the words "Throw her down!" rise from Night
   eerily,
   Spectre-spots of the blood of her body on some rotten wall?
   And the thin note of pity that came: "A King's daughter is she,"
   As they passed where she trodden was once by the chargers' footfall?

   Could such be the hauntings of men of to-day, at the cease
   Of pursuit, at the dusk-hour, ere slumber their senses could seal?
   Enghosted seers, kings -- one on horseback who asked "Is it peace?" . . .
   Yea, strange things and spectral may men have beheld in Jezreel!






A JOG-TROT PAIR


      WHO were the twain that trod this track
         So many times together
            Hither and back,
   In spells of certain and uncertain weather?

      Commonplace in conduct they
         Who wandered to and fro here
            Day by day:
   Two that few dwellers troubled themselves to know here.

      The very gravel-path was prim
         That daily they would follow:
            Borders trim:
   Never a wayward sprout, or hump, or hollow.

      Trite usages in tamest style
         Had tended to their plighting.
            "It's just worth while,
   Perhaps," they had said.  "And saves much sad good-nighting."

      And petty seemed the happenings
         That ministered to their joyance:
            Simple things,
   Onerous to satiate souls, increased their buoyance.

      Who could those common people be,
         Of days the plainest, barest?
            They were we;
   Yes; happier than the cleverest, smartest, rarest.




"THE CURTAINS NOW ARE DRAWN"


                 

      THE curtains now are drawn,
      And the spindrift strikes the glass,
      Blown up the jagged pass
      By the surly salt sou'-west,
      And the sneering glare is gone
      Behind the yonder crest,
         While she sings to me:
   "O the dream that thou art my Love, be it thine,
   And the dream that I am thy Love, be it mine,
   And death may come, but loving is divine."

                                

      I stand here in the rain,
      With its smite upon her stone,
      And the grasses that have grown
      Over women, children, men,
      And their texts that "Life is vain";
      But I hear the notes as when
         Once she sang to me:
   "O the dream that thou art my Love, be it thine,
   And the dream that I am thy Love, be it mine,
   And death may come, but loving is divine."




"ACCORDING TO THE MIGHTY WORKING"


                 

   WHEN moiling seems at cease
      In the vague void of night-time,
      And heaven's wide roomage stormless
      Between the dusk and light-time,
      And fear at last is formless,
   We call the allurement Peace.

                               

   Peace, this hid riot, Change,
      This revel of quick-cued mumming,
      This never truly being,
      This evermore becoming,
      This spinner's wheel onfleeing
   Outside perception's range.





"I WAS NOT HE"

   I WAS not he -- the man
   Who used to pilgrim to your gate,
   At whose smart step you grew elate,
      And rosed, as maidens can,
         For a brief span.

      It was not I who sang
   Beside the keys you touched so true
   With note-bent eyes, as if with you
      It counted not whence sprang
         The voice that rang . . .

      Yet though my destiny
   It was to miss your early sweet,
   You still, when turned to you my feet,
      Had sweet enough to be
         A prize for me!




THE WEST-OF-WESSEX GIRL


   A VERY West-of-Wessex girl,
      As blithe as blithe could be,
      Was once well-known to me,
   And she would laud her native town,
      And hope and hope that we
   Might sometime study up and down
      Its charms in company.

   But never I squired my Wessex girl
      In jaunts to Hoe or street
      When hearts were high in beat,
   Nor saw her in the marbled ways
      Where market-people meet
   That in her bounding early days
      Were friendly with her feet.

   Yet now my West-of-Wessex girl,
      When midnight hammers slow
      From Andrew's, blow by blow,
   As phantom draws me by the hand
      To the place -- Plymouth Hoe -- 
   Where side by side in life, as planned,
      We never were to go!




WELCOME HOME


      TO my native place
      Bent upon returning,
      Bosom all day burning
      To be where my race
   Well were known, 'twas much with me
   There to dwell in amity.

      Folk had sought their beds,
      But I hailed: to view me
      Under the moon, out to me
      Several pushed their heads,
   And to each I told my name,
   Plans, and that therefrom I came.

      "Did you? . . .  Ah, 'tis true
      I once heard, back a long time,
      Here had spent his young time,
      Some such man as you . . .
   Good-night."  The casement closed again,
   And I was left in the frosty lane.




GOING AND STAYING


                 

   THE moving sun-shapes on the spray,
   The sparkles where the brook was flowing,
   Pink faces, plightings, moonlit May,
   These were the things we wished would stay;
      But they were going.

                               

   Seasons of blankness as of snow,
   The silent bleed of a world decaying,
   The moan of multitudes in woe,
   These were the things we wished would go;
      But they were staying.

                              

   Then we looked closelier at Time,
   And saw his ghostly arms revolving
   To sweep off woeful things with prime,
   Things sinister with things sublime
      Alike dissolving.




READ BY MOONLIGHT


   I PAUSED to read a letter of hers
      By the moon's cold shine,
   Eyeing it in the tenderest way,
   And edging it up to catch each ray
      Upon her light-penned line.
   I did not know what years would flow
      Of her life's span and mine
   Ere I read another letter of hers
      By the moon's cold shine!

   I chance now on the last of hers,
      By the moon's cold shine;
   It is the one remaining page
   Out of the many shallow and sage
      Whereto she set her sign.
   Who could foresee there were to be
      Such letters of pain and pine
   Ere I should read this last of hers
      By the moon's cold shine!




AT A HOUSE IN HAMPSTEAD
SOMETIME THE DWELLING OF JOHN KEATS


   O POET, come you haunting here
   Where streets have stolen up all around,
   And never a nightingale pours one
      Full-throated sound?

   Drawn from your drowse by the Seven famed Hills,
   Thought you to find all just the same
   Here shining, as in hours of old,
      If you but came?

   What will you do in your surprise
   At seeing that changes wrought in Rome
   Are wrought yet more on the misty slope
      One time your home?

   Will you wake wind-wafts on these stairs?
   Swing the doors open noisily?
   Show as an umbraged ghost beside
      Your ancient tree?

   Or will you, softening, the while
   You further and yet further look,
   Learn that a laggard few would fain
      Preserve your nook? . . .

   -- Where the Piazza steps incline,
   And catch late light at eventide,
   I once stood, in that Rome, and thought,
      "'Twas here he died."

   I drew to a violet-sprinkled spot,
   Where day and night a pyramid keeps
   Uplifted its white hand, and said,
      "'Tis there he sleeps."

   Pleasanter now it is to hold
   That here, where sang he, more of him
   Remains than where he, tuneless, cold,
      Passed to the dim.






A WOMAN'S FANCY


   "AH Madam; you've indeed come back here?
      'Twas sad -- your husband's so swift death,
   And you away!  You shouldn't have left him:
         It hastened his last breath."

   "Dame, I am not the lady you think me;
      I know not her, nor know her name;
   I've come to lodge here -- a friendless woman;
         My health my only aim."

   She came; she lodged.  Wherever she rambled
      They held her as no other than
   The lady named; and told how her husband
         Had died a forsaken man.

   So often did they call her thuswise
      Mistakenly, by that man's name,
   So much did they declare about him,
         That his past form and fame

   Grew on her, till she pitied his sorrow
      As if she truly had been the cause -- 
   Yea, his deserter; and came to wonder
         What mould of man he was.

   "Tell me my history!" would exclaim she;
      " -- Our -- history," she said mournfully.
   "But -- you -- know, surely, Ma'am?" they would answer,
         Much in perplexity.

   Curious, she crept to his grave one evening,
      And a second time in the dusk of the morrow;
   Then a third time, with crescent emotion
         Like a bereaved wife's sorrow.

   No gravestone rose by the rounded hillock;
      -- "I marvel why this is?" she said.
   -- "He had no kindred, Ma'am, but you near."
         -- She set a stone at his head.

   She learnt to dream of him, and told them:
      "In slumber often uprises he,
   And says:`I am joyed that, after all, Dear,
         You've not deserted me!"

   At length died too this kinless woman,
      As he had died she had grown to crave;
   And at her dying she besought them
         To bury her in his grave.

   Such said, she had paused; until she added:
      "Call me by his name on the stone,
   As I were, first to last, his dearest,
         Not she who left him lone!"

   And this they did.  And so it became there
      That, by the strength of a tender whim,
   The stranger was she who bore his name there,
         Not she who wedded him.




HER SONG


   I SANG that song on Sunday,
      To witch an idle while,
   I sang that song on Monday,
      As fittest to beguile;
   I sang it as the year outwore,
         And the new slid in;
   I thought not what might shape before
      Another would begin.

   I sang that song in summer,
      All unforeknowingly,
   To him as a new-comer
      From regions strange to me:
   I sang it when in afteryears
         The shades stretched out,
   And paths were faint; and flocking fears
      Brought cup-eyed care and doubt.

   Sings he that song on Sundays
      In some dim land afar,
   On Saturdays, or Mondays,
      As when the evening star
   Glimpsed in upon his bending face
         And my hanging hair,
   And time untouched me with a trace
      Of soul-smart or despair?




A WET AUGUST


   NINE drops of water bead the jessamine,
   And nine-and-ninety smear the stones and tiles:
   -- 'Twas not so in that August -- full-rayed, fine -- 
   When we lived out-of-doors, sang songs, strode miles.

   Or was there then no noted radiancy
   Of summer?  Were dun clouds, a dribbling bough,
   Gilt over by the light I bore in me,
   And was the waste world just the same as now?

   It can have been so: yea, that threatenings
   Of coming down-drip on the sunless gray,
   By the then possibilities in things
   Were wrought more bright than brightest skies to-day.




THE DISSEMBLERS


   "IT was not you I came to please,
      Only myself," flipped she;
   "I like this spot of phantasies,
      And thought you far from me."
   But O, he was the secret spell
      That led her to the lea!

   "It was not she who shaped my ways,
      Or works, or thoughts," he said.
   "I scarcely marked her living days,
      Or missed her much when dead."
   But O, his joyance knew its knell
      When daisies hid her head!




TO A LADY PLAYING AND SINGING IN THE MORNING


      JOYFUL lady, sing!
   And I will lurk here listening,
   Though nought be done, and nought begun,
   And work-hours swift are scurrying.

      Sing, O lady, still!
   Aye, I will wait each note you trill,
   Though duties due that press to do
   This whole day long I unfulfil.

      " -- It is an evening tune;
   One not designed to waste the noon,"
   You say.  I know: time bids me go -- 
   For daytide passes too, too soon!

      But let indulgence be,
   This once, to my rash ecstasy:
   When sounds nowhere that carolled air
   My idled morn may comfort me!




"A MAN WAS DRAWING NEAR TO ME"


   ON that gray night of mournful drone,
   A part from aught to hear, to see,
   I dreamt not that from shires unknown
      In gloom, alone,
      By Halworthy,
   A man was drawing near to me.

   I'd no concern at anything,
   No sense of coming pull-heart play;
   Yet, under the silent outspreading
      Of even's wing
      Where Otterham lay,
   A man was riding up my way.

   I thought of nobody -- not of one,
   But only of trifles -- legends, ghosts -- 
   Though, on the moorland dim and dun
      That travellers shun
      About these coasts,
   The man had passed Tresparret Posts.

   There was no light at all inland,
   Only the seaward pharos-fire,
   Nothing to let me understand
      That hard at hand
      By Hennett Byre
   The man was getting nigh and nigher.

   There was a rumble at the door,
   A draught disturbed the drapery,
   And but a minute passed before,
      With gaze that bore
      My destiny,
   The man revealed himself to me.




THE STRANGE HOUSE
(MAX GATE, A.D. 2000)


   "I HEAR the piano playing -- 
      Just as a ghost might play."
   " -- O, but what are you saying?
      There's no piano to-day;
   Their old one was sold and broken;
      Years past it went amiss."
   " -- I heard it, or shouldn't have spoken:
         A strange house, this!

   "I catch some undertone here,
      From some one out of sight."
   " -- Impossible; we are alone here,
      And shall be through the night."
   " -- The parlour-door -- what stirred it?"
      " -- No one: no soul's in range."
   " -- But, anyhow, I heard it,
         And it seems strange!

   "Seek my own room I cannot -- 
      A figure is on the stair!"
   " -- What figure?  Nay, I scan not
      Any one lingering there.
   A bough outside is waving,
      And that's its shade by the moon."
   " -- Well, all is strange!  I am craving
         Strength to leave soon."

   " -- Ah, maybe you've some vision
      Of showings beyond our sphere;
   Some sight, sense, intuition
      Of what once happened here?
   The house is old; they've hinted
      It once held two love-thralls,
   And they may have imprinted
         Their dreams on its walls?

   "They were -- I think 'twas told me -- 
      Queer in their works and ways;
   The teller would often hold me
      With weird tales of those days.
   Some folk can not abide here,
      But we -- we do not care
   Who loved, laughed, wept, or died here,
         Knew joy, or despair."




"AS 'TWERE TO-NIGHT"
   AS 'twere to-night, in the brief space
      Of a far eventime,
      My spirit rang achime
   At vision of a girl of grace;
   As 'twere to-night, in the brief space
      Of a far eventime.

   As 'twere at noontide of to-morrow
      I airily walked and talked,
      And wondered as I walked
   What it could mean, this soar from sorrow;
   As 'twere at noontide of to-morrow
      I airily walked and talked.

   As 'twere at waning of this week
      Broke a new life on me;
      Trancings of bliss to be
   In some dim dear land soon to seek;
   As 'twere at waning of this week
      Broke a new life on me!




THE CONTRETEMPS


      A FORWARD rush by the lamp in the gloom,
         And we clasped, and almost kissed;
      But she was not the woman whom
      I had promised to meet in the thawing brume
   On that harbour-bridge; nor was I he of her tryst.

      So loosening from me swift she said:
         "O why, why feign to be
      The one I had meant! -- to whom I have sped
      To fly with, being so sorrily wed!"
   -- 'Twas thus and thus that she upbraided me.

      My assignation had struck upon
         Some others' like it, I found.
      And her lover rose on the night anon;
      And then her husband entered on
   The lamplit, snowflaked, sloppiness around.

      "Take her and welcome, man!" he cried:
         "I wash my hands of her.
      I'll find me twice as good a bride!"
      -- All this to me, whom he had eyed,
   Plainly, as his wife's planned deliverer.

      And next the lover: "Little I knew,
         Madam, you had a third!
      Kissing here in my very view!"
      -- Husband and lover then withdrew.
   I let them; and I told them not they erred.

      Why not?  Well, there faced she and I -- 
         Two strangers who'd kissed, or near,
      Chancewise.  To see stand weeping by
      A woman once embraced, will try
   The tension of a man the most austere.

      So it began; and I was young,
         She pretty, by the lamp,
      As flakes came waltzing down among
      The waves of her clinging hair, that hung
   Heavily on her temples, dark and damp.

      And there alone still stood we two;
         She one cast off for me,
      Or so it seemed: while night ondrew,
      Forcing a parley what should do
   We twain hearts caught in one catastrophe.

      In stranded souls a common strait
         Wakes latencies unknown,
      Whose impulse may precipitate
      A life-long leap.  The hour was late,
   And there was the Jersey boat with its funnel agroan.

      "Is wary walking worth much pother?"
         It grunted, as still it stayed.
      "One pairing is as good as another
      Where all is venture!  Take each other,
   And scrap the oaths that you have aforetime made." . . .

      -- Of the four involved there walks but one
         On earth at this late day.
      And what of the chapter so begun?
      In that odd complex what was done?
      Well; happiness comes in full to none:
   Let peace lie on lulled lips: I will not say.

WEYMOUTH.




A GENTLEMAN'S EPITAPH ON HIMSELF AND A LADY, WHO WERE BURIED
TOGETHER


   I DWELT in the shade of a city,
      She far by the sea,
   With folk perhaps good, gracious, witty;
      But never with me.

   Her form on the ballroom's smooth flooring
      I never once met,
   To guide her with accents adoring
      Through Weippert's "First Set." {46}

   I spent my life's seasons with pale ones
      In Vanity Fair,
   And she enjoyed hers among hale ones
      In salt-smelling air.

   Maybe she had eyes of deep colour,
      Maybe they were blue,
   Maybe as she aged they got duller;
      That never I knew.

   She may have had lips like the coral,
      But I never kissed them,
   Saw pouting, nor curling in quarrel,
      Nor sought for, nor missed them.

   Not a word passed of love all our lifetime,
      Between us, nor thrill;
   We'd never a husband-and-wife time,
      For good or for ill.

   Yet as one dust, through bleak days and vernal,
      Lie I and lies she,
   This never-known lady, eternal
      Companion to me!




THE OLD GOWN



   I HAVE seen her in gowns the brightest,
      Of azure, green, and red,
   And in the simplest, whitest,
      Muslined from heel to head;
   I have watched her walking, riding,
      Shade-flecked by a leafy tree,
   Or in fixed thought abiding
      By the foam-fingered sea.

   In woodlands I have known her,
      When boughs were mourning loud,
   In the rain-reek she has shown her
      Wild-haired and watery-browed.
   And once or twice she has cast me
      As she pomped along the street
   Court-clad, ere quite she had passed me,
      A glance from her chariot-seat.

   But in my memoried passion
      For evermore stands she
   In the gown of fading fashion
      She wore that night when we,
   Doomed long to part, assembled
      In the snug small room; yea, when
   She sang with lips that trembled,
      "Shall I see his face again?"




A NIGHT IN NOVEMBER


   I MARKED when the weather changed,
   And the panes began to quake,
   And the winds rose up and ranged,
   That night, lying half-awake.

   Dead leaves blew into my room,
   And alighted upon my bed,
   And a tree declared to the gloom
   Its sorrow that they were shed.

   One leaf of them touched my hand,
   And I thought that it was you
   There stood as you used to stand,
   And saying at last you knew!






A DUETTIST TO HER PIANOFORTE
SONG OF SILENCE
(E. L. H. --H. C. H.)


   SINCE every sound moves memories,
      How can I play you
   Just as I might if you raised no scene,
   By your ivory rows, of a form between
   My vision and your time-worn sheen,
         As when each day you
   Answered our fingers with ecstasy?
   So it's hushed, hushed, hushed, you are for me!

   And as I am doomed to counterchord
      Her notes no more
   In those old things I used to know,
   In a fashion, when we practised so,
   "Good-night! -- Good-bye!" to your pleated show
         Of silk, now hoar,
   Each nodding hammer, and pedal and key,
   For dead, dead, dead, you are to me!

   I fain would second her, strike to her stroke,
      As when she was by,
   Aye, even from the ancient clamorous "Fall
   Of Paris," or "Battle of Prague" withal,
   To the "Roving Minstrels," or "Elfin Call"
         Sung soft as a sigh:
   But upping ghosts press achefully,
   And mute, mute, mute, you are for me!

   Should I fling your polyphones, plaints, and quavers
      Afresh on the air,
   Too quick would the small white shapes be here
   Of the fellow twain of hands so dear;
   And a black-tressed profile, and pale smooth ear;
         -- Then how shall I bear
   Such heavily-haunted harmony?
   Nay: hushed, hushed, hushed you are for me!




"WHERE THREE ROADS JOINED"


   WHERE three roads joined it was green and fair,
   And over a gate was the sun-glazed sea,
   And life laughed sweet when I halted there;
   Yet there I never again would be.

   I am sure those branchways are brooding now,
   With a wistful blankness upon their face,
   While the few mute passengers notice how
   Spectre-beridden is the place;

   Which nightly sighs like a laden soul,
   And grieves that a pair, in bliss for a spell
   Not far from thence, should have let it roll
   Away from them down a plumbless well

   While the phasm of him who fared starts up,
   And of her who was waiting him sobs from near,
   As they haunt there and drink the wormwood cup
   They filled for themselves when their sky was clear.

   Yes, I see those roads -- now rutted and bare,
   While over the gate is no sun-glazed sea;
   And though life laughed when I halted there,
   It is where I never again would be.




"AND THERE WAS A GREAT CALM"
(ON THE SIGNING OF THE ARMISTICE, Nov. 11, 1918)


                 

   THERE had been years of Passion -- scorching, cold,
   And much Despair, and Anger heaving high,
   Care whitely watching, Sorrows manifold,
   Among the young, among the weak and old,
   And the pensive Spirit of Pity whispered, "Why?"

                               

   Men had not paused to answer.  Foes distraught
   Pierced the thinned peoples in a brute-like blindness,
   Philosophies that sages long had taught,
   And Selflessness, were as an unknown thought,
   And "Hell!" and "Shell!" were yapped at Lovingkindness.

                              

   The feeble folk at home had grown full-used
   To "dug-outs," "snipers," "Huns," from the war-adept
   In the mornings heard, and at evetides perused;
   To day -- dreamt men in millions, when they mused -- 
   To nightmare-men in millions when they slept.

  

   Waking to wish existence timeless, null,
   Sirius they watched above where armies fell;
   He seemed to check his flapping when, in the lull
   Of night a boom came thencewise, like the dull
   Plunge of a stone dropped into some deep well.

                     

   So, when old hopes that earth was bettering slowly
   Were dead and damned, there sounded "War is done!"
   One morrow.  Said the bereft, and meek, and lowly,
   "Will men some day be given to grace? yea, wholly,
   And in good sooth, as our dreams used to run?"

                     

   Breathless they paused.  Out there men raised their glance
   To where had stood those poplars lank and lopped,
   As they had raised it through the four years' dance
   Of Death in the now familiar flats of France;
   And murmured, "Strange, this!  How?  All firing stopped?"

                    

   Aye; all was hushed.  The about-to-fire fired not,
   The aimed-at moved away in trance-lipped song.
   One checkless regiment slung a clinching shot
   And turned.  The Spirit of Irony smirked out, "What?
   Spoil peradventures woven of Rage and Wrong?"

                    

   Thenceforth no flying fires inflamed the gray,
   No hurtlings shook the dewdrop from the thorn,
   No moan perplexed the mute bird on the spray;
   Worn horses mused: "We are not whipped to-day";
   No weft-winged engines blurred the moon's thin horn.

  

   Calm fell.  From Heaven distilled a clemency;
   There was peace on earth, and silence in the sky;
   Some could, some could not, shake off misery:
   The Sinister Spirit sneered: "It had to be!"
   And again the Spirit of Pity whispered, "Why?"




HAUNTING FINGERS
A PHANTASY IN A MUSEUM OF MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS


            "ARE you awake,
         Comrades, this silent night?
      Well 'twere if all of our glossy gluey make
   Lay in the damp without, and fell to fragments quite!"

            "O viol, my friend,
         I watch, though Phosphor nears,
      And I fain would drowse away to its utter end
   This dumb dark stowage after our loud melodious years!"

   And they felt past handlers clutch them,
      Though none was in the room,
   Old players' dead fingers touch them,
         Shrunk in the tomb.

            "'Cello, good mate,
         You speak my mind as yours:
      Doomed to this voiceless, crippled, corpselike state,
   Who, dear to famed Amphion, trapped here, long endures?"

            "Once I could thrill
         The populace through and through,
      Wake them to passioned pulsings past their will." . . .
   (A contra-basso spake so, and the rest sighed anew.)

   And they felt old muscles travel
      Over their tense contours,
   And with long skill unravel
         Cunningest scores.

            "The tender pat
         Of her aery finger-tips
      Upon me daily -- I rejoiced thereat!"
   (Thuswise a harpsicord, as from dampered lips.)

            "My keys' white shine,
         Now sallow, met a hand
      Even whiter. . . .  Tones of hers fell forth with mine
   In sowings of sound so sweet no lover could withstand!"

   And its clavier was filmed with fingers
      Like tapering flames -- wan, cold -- 
   Or the nebulous light that lingers
         In charnel mould.

            "Gayer than most
         Was I," reverbed a drum;
      "The regiments, marchings, throngs, hurrahs!  What a host
   I stirred -- even when crape mufflings gagged me well-nigh dumb!"

            Trilled an aged viol:
         "Much tune have I set free
      To spur the dance, since my first timid trial
   Where I had birth -- far hence, in sun-swept Italy!"

   And he feels apt touches on him
      From those that pressed him then;
   Who seem with their glance to con him,
         Saying, "Not again!"

            "A holy calm,"
         Mourned a shawm's voice subdued,
      "Steeped my Cecilian rhythms when hymn and psalm
   Poured from devout souls met in Sabbath sanctitude."

            "I faced the sock
         Nightly," twanged a sick lyre,
      "Over ranked lights!  O charm of life in mock,
   O scenes that fed love, hope, wit, rapture, mirth, desire!"

   Thus they, till each past player
      Stroked thinner and more thin,
   And the morning sky grew grayer
         And day crawled in.




THE WOMAN I MET


   A STRANGER, I threaded sunken-hearted
         A lamp-lit crowd;
   And anon there passed me a soul departed,
         Who mutely bowed.
   In my far-off youthful years I had met her,
   Full-pulsed; but now, no more life's debtor,
         Onward she slid
      In a shroud that furs half-hid.

   "Why do you trouble me, dead woman,
         Trouble me;
   You whom I knew when warm and human?
         -- How it be
   That you quitted earth and are yet upon it
   Is, to any who ponder on it,
         Past being read!"
      "Still, it is so," she said.

   "These were my haunts in my olden sprightly
         Hours of breath;
   Here I went tempting frail youth nightly
         To their death;
   But you deemed me chaste -- me, a tinselled sinner!
   How thought you one with pureness in her
         Could pace this street
      Eyeing some man to greet?

   "Well; your very simplicity made me love you
         Mid such town dross,
   Till I set not Heaven itself above you,
         Who grew my Cross;
   For you'd only nod, despite how I sighed for you;
   So you tortured me, who fain would have died for you!
         -- What I suffered then
      Would have paid for the sins of ten!

   "Thus went the days.  I feared you despised me
         To fling me a nod
   Each time, no more: till love chastised me
         As with a rod
   That a fresh bland boy of no assurance
   Should fire me with passion beyond endurance,
         While others all
      I hated, and loathed their call.

   "I said:`It is his mother's spirit
         Hovering around
   To shield him, maybe!`  I used to fear it,
         As still I found
   My beauty left no least impression,
   And remnants of pride withheld confession
         Of my true trade
      By speaking; so I delayed.

   "I said:`Perhaps with a costly flower
         He'll be beguiled.`
   I held it, in passing you one late hour,
         To your face: you smiled,
   Keeping step with the throng; though you did not see there
   A single one that rivalled me there! . . .
         Well: it's all past.
      I died in the Lock at last."

   So walked the dead and I together
         The quick among,
   Elbowing our kind of every feather
         Slowly and long;
   Yea, long and slowly.  That a phantom should stalk there
   With me seemed nothing strange, and talk there
         That winter night
      By flaming jets of light.

   She showed me Juans who feared their call-time,
         Guessing their lot;
   She showed me her sort that cursed their fall-time,
         And that did not.
   Till suddenly murmured she: "Now, tell me,
   Why asked you never, ere death befell me,
         To have my love,
      Much as I dreamt thereof?"

   I could not answer.  And she, well weeting
         All in my heart,
   Said: "God your guardian kept our fleeting
         Forms apart!"
   Sighing and drawing her furs around her
   Over the shroud that tightly bound her,
         With wafts as from clay
      She turned and thinned away.




"IF IT'S EVER SPRING AGAIN"



   IF it's ever spring again,
      Spring again,
   I shall go where went I when
   Down the moor-cock splashed, and hen,
   Seeing me not, amid their flounder,
   Standing with my arm around her;
   If it's ever spring again,
      Spring again,
   I shall go where went I then.

   If it's ever summer-time,
      Summer-time,
   With the hay crop at the prime,
   And the cuckoos -- two -- in rhyme,
   As they used to be, or seemed to,
   We shall do as long we've dreamed to,
   If it's ever summer-time,
      Summer-time,
   With the hay, and bees achime.




THE TWO HOUSES


            IN the heart of night,
         When farers were not near,
      The left house said to the house on the right,
   "I have marked your rise, O smart newcomer here."

            Said the right, cold-eyed:
         "Newcomer here I am,
      Hence haler than you with your cracked old hide,
   Loose casements, wormy beams, and doors that jam.

            "Modern my wood,
         My hangings fair of hue;
      While my windows open as they should,
   And water-pipes thread all my chambers through.

            "Your gear is gray,
         Your face wears furrows untold."
      " -- Yours might," mourned the other, "if you held, brother,
   The Presences from aforetime that I hold.

            "You have not known
         Men's lives, deaths, toils, and teens;
      You are but a heap of stick and stone:
   A new house has no sense of the have-beens.

            "Void as a drum
         You stand: I am packed with these,
      Though, strangely, living dwellers who come
   See not the phantoms all my substance sees!

            "Visible in the morning
         Stand they, when dawn drags in;
      Visible at night; yet hint or warning
   Of these thin elbowers few of the inmates win.

            "Babes new-brought-forth
         Obsess my rooms; straight-stretched
      Lank corpses, ere outborne to earth;
   Yea, throng they as when first from the 'Byss upfetched.

            "Dancers and singers
         Throb in me now as once;
      Rich-noted throats and gossamered fingers
   Of heels; the learned in love-lore and the dunce.

            "Note here within
         The bridegroom and the bride,
      Who smile and greet their friends and kin,
   And down my stairs depart for tracks untried.

            "Where such inbe,
         A dwelling's character
      Takes theirs, and a vague semblancy
   To them in all its limbs, and light, and atmosphere.

            "Yet the blind folk
         My tenants, who come and go
      In the flesh mid these, with souls unwoke,
   Of such sylph-like surrounders do not know."

            " -- Will the day come,"
         Said the new one, awestruck, faint,
      "When I shall lodge shades dim and dumb -- 
   And with such spectral guests become acquaint?"

            " -- That will it, boy;
         Such shades will people thee,
      Each in his misery, irk, or joy,
   And print on thee their presences as on me."




ON STINSFORD HILL AT MIDNIGHT


   I GLIMPSED a woman's muslined form
      Sing-songing airily
   Against the moon; and still she sang,
      And took no heed of me.

   Another trice, and I beheld
      What first I had not scanned,
   That now and then she tapped and shook
      A timbrel in her hand.

   So late the hour, so white her drape,
      So strange the look it lent
   To that blank hill, I could not guess
      What phantastry it meant.

   Then burst I forth: "Why such from you?
      Are you so happy now?"
   Her voice swam on; nor did she show
      Thought of me anyhow.

   I called again: "Come nearer; much
      That kind of note I need!"
   The song kept softening, loudening on,
      In placid calm unheed.

   "What home is yours now?" then I said;
      "You seem to have no care."
   But the wild wavering tune went forth
      As if I had not been there.

   "This world is dark, and where you are,"
      I said, "I cannot be!"
   But still the happy one sang on,
      And had no heed of me.




THE FALLOW DEER AT THE LONELY HOUSE


   ONE without looks in to-night
      Through the curtain-chink
   From the sheet of glistening white;
   One without looks in to-night
      As we sit and think
      By the fender-brink.

   We do not discern those eyes
      Watching in the snow;
   Lit by lamps of rosy dyes
   We do not discern those eyes
      Wondering, aglow,
      Fourfooted, tiptoe.




THE SELFSAME SONG


   A BIRD bills the selfsame song,
   With never a fault in its flow,
   That we listened to here those long
      Long years ago.

   A pleasing marvel is how
   A strain of such rapturous rote
   Should have gone on thus till now
      Unchanged in a note!

   -- But it's not the selfsame bird. -- 
   No: perished to dust is he . . .
   As also are those who heard
      That song with me.




THE WANDERER


   THERE is nobody on the road
      But I,
   And no beseeming abode
      I can try
   For shelter, so abroad
      I must lie.

   The stars feel not far up,
      And to be
   The lights by which I sup
      Glimmeringly,
   Set out in a hollow cup
      Over me.

   They wag as though they were
      Panting for joy
   Where they shine, above all care,
      And annoy,
   And demons of despair -- 
      Life's alloy.

   Sometimes outside the fence
      Feet swing past,
   Clock-like, and then go hence,
      Till at last
   There is a silence, dense,
      Deep, and vast.

   A wanderer, witch-drawn
      To and fro,
   To-morrow, at the dawn,
      On I go,
   And where I rest anon
      Do not know!

   Yet it's meet -- this bed of hay
      And roofless plight;
   For there's a house of clay,
      My own, quite,
   To roof me soon, all day
      And all night.




A WIFE COMES BACK


   THIS is the story a man told me
      Of his life's one day of dreamery.

      A woman came into his room
   Between the dawn and the creeping day:
   She was the years-wed wife from whom
   He had parted, and who lived far away,
         As if strangers they.

      He wondered, and as she stood
   She put on youth in her look and air,
   And more was he wonderstruck as he viewed
   Her form and flesh bloom yet more fair
         While he watched her there;

      Till she freshed to the pink and brown
   That were hers on the night when first they met,
   When she was the charm of the idle town
   And he the pick of the club-fire set . . .
         His eyes grew wet,

      And he stretched his arms: "Stay -- rest! -- "
   He cried.  "Abide with me so, my own!"
   But his arms closed in on his hard bare breast;
   She had vanished with all he had looked upon
         Of her beauty: gone.

      He clothed, and drew downstairs,
   But she was not in the house, he found;
   And he passed out under the leafy pairs
   Of the avenue elms, and searched around
         To the park-pale bound.

      He mounted, and rode till night
   To the city to which she had long withdrawn,
   The vision he bore all day in his sight
   Being her young self as pondered on
         In the dim of dawn.

      " -- The lady here long ago -- 
   Is she now here? -- young -- or such age as she is?"
   " -- She is still here." -- "Thank God.  Let her know;
   She'll pardon a comer so late as this
      Whom she'd fain not miss."

      She received him -- an ancient dame,
   Who hemmed, with features frozen and numb,
   "How strange! -- I'd almost forgotten your name! -- 
   A call just now -- is troublesome;
         Why did you come?"




A YOUNG MAN'S EXHORTATION


      CALL off your eyes from care
   By some determined deftness; put forth joys
   Dear as excess without the core that cloys,
      And charm Life's lourings fair.

      Exalt and crown the hour
   That girdles us, and fill it full with glee,
   Blind glee, excelling aught could ever be
      Were heedfulness in power.

      Send up such touching strains
   That limitless recruits from Fancy's pack
   Shall rush upon your tongue, and tender back
      All that your soul contains.

      For what do we know best?
   That a fresh love-leaf crumpled soon will dry,
   And that men moment after moment die,
      Of all scope dispossest.

      If I have seen one thing
   It is the passing preciousness of dreams;
   That aspects are within us; and who seems
      Most kingly is the King.




AT LULWORTH COVE A CENTURY BACK


   HAD I but lived a hundred years ago
   I might have gone, as I have gone this year,
   By Warmwell Cross on to a Cove I know,
   And Time have placed his finger on me there:

   " -- You see that man -- ?" -- I might have looked, and said,
   "O yes: I see him.  One that boat has brought
   Which dropped down Channel round Saint Alban's Head.
   So commonplace a youth calls not my thought."

   " -- You see that man -- ?" -- "Why yes; I told you; yes:
   Of an idling town-sort; thin; hair brown in hue;
   And as the evening light scants less and less
   He looks up at a star, as many do."

   " -- You see that man -- ?" -- "Nay, leave me!" then I plead,
   "I have fifteen miles to vamp across the lea,
   And it grows dark, and I am weary-kneed:
   I have said the third time; yes, that man I see!

   "Good.  That man goes to Rome -- to death, despair;
   And no one notes him now but you and I:
   A hundred years, and the world will follow him there,
   And bend with reverence where his ashes lie."




A BYGONE OCCASION


      THAT night, that night,
      That song, that song!
   Will such again be evened quite
      Through lifetimes long?

      No mirth was shown
      To outer seers,
   But mood to match has not been known
      In modern years.

      O eyes that smiled,
      O lips that lured;
   That such would last was one beguiled
      To think ensured!

      That night, that night,
      That song, that song;
   O drink to its recalled delight,
      Though tears may throng!




TWO SERENADES


I
 -- On Christmas Eve -- 


   LATE on Christmas Eve, in the street alone,
   Outside a house, on the pavement-stone,
   I sang to her, as we'd sung together
   On former eves ere I felt her tether. -- 
   Above the door of green by me
   Was she, her casement seen by me;
      But she would not heed
      What I melodied
      In my soul's sore need -- 
      She would not heed.

   Cassiopeia overhead,
   And the Seven of the Wain, heard what I said
   As I bent me there, and voiced, and fingered
   Upon the strings. . . . Long, long I lingered:
   Only the curtains hid from her
   One whom caprice had bid from her;
      But she did not come,
      And my heart grew numb
      And dull my strum;
      She did not come.



II
 -- A Year Later -- 


   I SKIMMED the strings; I sang quite low;
   I hoped she would not come or know
   That the house next door was the one now dittied,
   Not hers, as when I had played unpitied;
   -- Next door, where dwelt a heart fresh stirred,
   My new Love, of good will to me,
   Unlike my old Love chill to me,
   Who had not cared for my notes when heard:
      Yet that old Love came
      To the other's name
      As hers were the claim;
      Yea, the old Love came

   My viol sank mute, my tongue stood still,
   I tried to sing on, but vain my will:
   I prayed she would guess of the later, and leave me;
   She stayed, as though, were she slain by the smart,
   She would bear love's burn for a newer heart.
   The tense-drawn moment wrought to bereave me
   Of voice, and I turned in a dumb despair
   At her finding I'd come to another there.
      Sick I withdrew
      At love's grim hue
      Ere my last Love knew;
      Sick I withdrew.

From an old copy.




THE WEDDING MORNING


      TABITHA dressed for her wedding: -- 
      "Tabby, why look so sad?"
   " -- O I feel a great gloominess spreading, spreading,
      Instead of supremely glad! . . .

      "I called on Carry last night,
      And he came whilst I was there,
   Not knowing I'd called.  So I kept out of sight,
      And I heard what he said to her:

      "` -- Ah, I'd far liefer marry
      -- You -- , Dear, to-morrow!` he said,
  `But that cannot be.` -- O I'd give him to Carry,
      And willingly see them wed,

      "But how can I do it when
      His baby will soon be born?
   After that I hope I may die.  And then
      She can have him.  I shall not mourn!"







   YOU were here at his young beginning,
      You are not here at his ag d end;
   Off he coaxed you from Life's mad spinning,
      Lest you should see his form extend
         Shivering, sighing,
         Slowly dying,
      And a tear on him expend.

   So it comes that we stand lonely
      In the star-lit avenue,
   Dropping broken lipwords only,
      For we hear no songs from you,
         Such as flew here
         For the new year
      Once, while six bells swung thereto.




THE CHIMES PLAY "LIFE'S A BUMPER!"


   "AWAKE!  I'm off to cities far away,"
   I said; and rose, on peradventures bent.
   The chimes played "Life's a Bumper!" on that day
   To the measure of my walking as I went:
   Their sweetness frisked and floated on the lea,
   As they played out "Life's a Bumper!" there to me.

   "Awake!" I said.  "I go to take a bride!"
   -- The sun arose behind me ruby-red
   As I journeyed townwards from the countryside,
   The chiming bells saluting near ahead.
   Their sweetness swelled in tripping tings of glee
   As they played out "Life's a Bumper!" there to me.

   "Again arise."  I seek a turfy slope,
   And go forth slowly on an autumn noon,
   And there I lay her who has been my hope,
   And think, "O may I follow hither soon!"
   While on the wind the chimes come cheerily,
   Playing out "Life's a Bumper!" there to me.




"I WORKED NO WILE TO MEET YOU"



   I WORKED no wile to meet you,
      My sight was set elsewhere,
   I sheered about to shun you,
      And lent your life no care.
   I was unprimed to greet you
      At such a date and place,
   Constraint alone had won you
      Vision of my strange face!

   You did not seek to see me
      Then or at all, you said,
   -- Meant passing when you neared me,
      But stumblingblocks forbade.
   You even had thought to flee me,
      By other mindings moved;
   No influent star endeared me,
      Unknown, unrecked, unproved!

   What, then, was there to tell us
      The flux of flustering hours
   Of their own tide would bring us
      By no device of ours
   To where the daysprings well us
      Heart-hydromels that cheer,
   Till Time enearth and swing us
      Round with the turning sphere.




AT THE RAILWAY STATION, UPWAY


      "THERE is not much that I can do,
   For I've no money that's quite my own!"
      Spoke up the pitying child -- 
   A little boy with a violin
   At the station before the train came in, -- 
   "But I can play my fiddle to you,
   And a nice one 'tis, and good in tone!"

      The man in the handcuffs smiled;
   The constable looked, and he smiled, too,
      As the fiddle began to twang;
   And the man in the handcuffs suddenly sang
         Uproariously:
         "This life so free
         Is the thing for me!"
   And the constable smiled, and said no word,
   As if unconscious of what he heard;
   And so they went on till the train came in -- 
   The convict, and boy with the violin.




SIDE BY SIDE


   SO there sat they,
   The estranged two,
   Thrust in one pew
   By chance that day;
   Placed so, breath-nigh,
   Each comer unwitting
   Who was to be sitting
   In touch close by.

   Thus side by side
   Blindly alighted,
   They seemed united
   As groom and bride,
   Who'd not communed
   For many years -- 
   Lives from twain spheres
   With hearts distuned.

   Her fringes brushed
   His garment's hem
   As the harmonies rushed
   Through each of them:
   Her lips could be heard
   In the creed and psalms,
   And their fingers neared
   At the giving of alms.

   And women and men,
   The matins ended,
   By looks commended
   Them, joined again.
   Quickly said she,
   "Don't undeceive them -- 
   Better thus leave them:"
   "Quite so," said he.

   Slight words! -- the last
   Between them said,
   Those two, once wed,
   Who had not stood fast.
   Diverse their ways
   From the western door,
   To meet no more
   In their span of days.




DREAM OF THE CITY SHOPWOMAN


   'TWERE sweet to have a comrade here,
   Who'd vow to love this garreteer,
   By city people's snap and sneer
         Tried oft and hard!

   We'd rove a truant cock and hen
   To some snug solitary glen,
   And never be seen to haunt again
         This teeming yard.

   Within a cot of thatch and clay
   We'd list the flitting pipers play,
   Our lives a twine of good and gay
         Enwreathed discreetly;

   Our blithest deeds so neighbouring wise
   That doves should coo in soft surprise,
   "These must belong to Paradise
         Who live so sweetly."

   Our clock should be the closing flowers,
   Our sprinkle-bath the passing showers,
   Our church the alleyed willow bowers,
         The truth our theme;

   And infant shapes might soon abound:
   Their shining heads would dot us round
   Like mushroom balls on grassy ground . . .
         -- But all is dream!

   O God, that creatures framed to feel
   A yearning nature's strong appeal
   Should writhe on this eternal wheel
         In rayless grime;

   And vainly note, with wan regret,
   Each star of early promise set;
   Till Death relieves, and they forget
         Their one Life's time!





A MAIDEN'S PLEDGE



   I DO not wish to win your vow
   To take me soon or late as bride,
   And lift me from the nook where now
   I tarry your farings to my side.
   I am blissful ever to abide
   In this green labyrinth -- let all be,
   If but, whatever may betide,
   You do not leave off loving me!

   Your comet-comings I will wait
   With patience time shall not wear through;
   The yellowing years will not abate
   My largened love and truth to you,
   Nor drive me to complaint undue
   Of absence, much as I may pine,
   If never another 'twixt us two
   Shall come, and you stand wholly mine.




THE CHILD AND THE SAGE


   YOU say, O Sage, when weather-checked,
      "I have been favoured so
   With cloudless skies, I must expect
      This dash of rain or snow."

   "Since health has been my lot," you say,
      "So many months of late,
   I must not chafe that one short day
      Of sickness mars my state."

   You say, "Such bliss has been my share
      From Love's unbroken smile,
   It is but reason I should bear
      A cross therein awhile."

   And thus you do not count upon
      Continuance of joy;
   But, when at ease, expect anon
      A burden of annoy.

   But, Sage -- this Earth -- why not a place
      Where no reprisals reign,
   Where never a spell of pleasantness
      Makes reasonable a pain?






MISMET


                 

      HE was leaning by a face,
      He was looking into eyes,
      And he knew a trysting-place,
      And he heard seductive sighs;
         But the face,
         And the eyes,
         And the place,
         And the sighs,
   Were not, alas, the right ones -- the ones meet for him -- 
   Though fine and sweet the features, and the feelings all abrim.

                               

      She was looking at a form,
      She was listening for a tread,
      She could feel a waft of charm
      When a certain name was said;
         But the form,
         And the tread,
         And the charm
         Of name said,
   Were the wrong ones for her, and ever would be so,
   While the heritor of the right it would have saved her soul to know!




AN AUTUMN RAIN-SCENE


   THERE trudges one to a merry-making
         With a sturdy swing,
      On whom the rain comes down.

   To fetch the saving medicament
         Is another bent,
      On whom the rain comes down.

   One slowly drives his herd to the stall
         Ere ill befall,
      On whom the rain comes down.

   This bears his missives of life and death
         With quickening breath,
      On whom the rain comes down.

   One watches for signals of wreck or war
         From the hill afar,
      On whom the rain comes down.

   No care if he gain a shelter or none,
         Unhired moves one,
      On whom the rain comes down.

   And another knows nought of its chilling fall
         Upon him at all,
      On whom the rain comes down.





MEDITATIONS ON A HOLIDAY
(A NEW THEME TO AN OLD FOLK-JINGLE)


   'TIS May morning,
   All-adorning,
   No cloud warning
      Of rain to-day.
   Where shall I go to,
   Go to, go to? -- 
   Can I say No to
      Lyonnesse-way?

   Well -- what reason
   Now at this season
   Is there for treason
      To other shrines?
   Tristram is not there,
   Isolt forgot there,
   New eras blot there
      Sought-for signs!

   Stratford-on-Avon -- 
   Poesy-paven -- 
   I'll find a haven
      There, somehow! -- 
   Nay -- I'm but caught of
   Dreams long thought of,
   The Swan knows nought of
      His Avon now!

   What shall it be, then,
   I go to see, then,
   Under the plea, then,
      Of votary?
   I'll go to Lakeland,
   Lakeland, Lakeland,
   Certainly Lakeland
      Let it be.

   But -- why to that place,
   That place, that place,
   Such a hard come-at place
      Need I fare?
   When its bard cheers no more,
   Loves no more, fears no more,
   Sees no more, hears no more
      Anything there!

   Ah, there is Scotland,
   Burns's Scotland,
   And Waverley's.  To what land
      Better can I hie? -- 
   Yet -- if no whit now
   Feel those of it now -- 
   Care not a bit now
      For it -- why I?

   I'll seek a town street,
   Aye, a brick-brown street,
   Quite a tumbledown street,
      Drawing no eyes.
   For a Mary dwelt there,
   And a Percy felt there
   Heart of him melt there,
      A Claire likewise.

   Why incline to -- that -- city,
   Such a city, -- that -- city,
   Now a mud-bespat city! -- 
      Care the lovers who
   Now live and walk there,
   Sit there and talk there,
   Buy there, or hawk there,
      Or wed, or woo?

   Laughters in a volley
   Greet so fond a folly
   As nursing melancholy
      In this and that spot,
   Which, with most endeavour,
   Those can visit never,
   But for ever and ever
      Will now know not!

   If, on lawns Elysian,
   With a broadened vision
   And a faint derision
      Conscious be they,
   How they might reprove me
   That these fancies move me,
   Think they ill behoove me,
      Smile, and say:

   "What! -- our hoar old houses,
   Where the past dead-drowses,
   Nor a child nor spouse is
      Of our name at all?
   Such abodes to care for,
   Inquire about and bear for,
   And suffer wear and tear for -- 
      How weak of you and small!"






AN EXPERIENCE


   WIT, weight, or wealth there was not
      In anything that was said,
      In anything that was done;
   All was of scope to cause not
      A triumph, dazzle, or dread
      To even the subtlest one,
         My friend,
      To even the subtlest one.

   But there was a new afflation -- 
      An aura zephyring round,
      That care infected not:
   It came as a salutation,
      And, in my sweet astound,
      I scarcely witted what
         Might pend,
      I scarcely witted what.

   The hills in samewise to me
      Spoke, as they grayly gazed,
      -- First hills to speak so yet!
   The thin-edged breezes blew me
      What I, though cobwebbed, crazed,
      Was never to forget,
         My friend,
      Was never to forget!




THE BEAUTY


   O DO not praise my beauty more,
      In such word-wild degree,
   And say I am one all eyes adore;
      For these things harass me!

   But do for ever softly say:
      "From now unto the end
   Come weal, come wanzing, come what may,
      Dear, I will be your friend."

   I hate my beauty in the glass:
      My beauty is not I:
   I wear it: none cares whether, alas,
      Its wearer live or die!

   The inner I O care for, then,
      Yea, me and what I am,
   And shall be at the gray hour when
      My cheek begins to clam.



THE COLLECTOR CLEANS HIS PICTURE


      HOW I remember cleaning that strange picture!
   I had been deep in duty for my sick neighbour -- 
   His besides my own -- over several Sundays,
   Often, too, in the week; so with parish pressures,
   Baptisms, burials, doctorings, conjugal counsel -- 
   All the whatnots asked of a rural parson -- 
   Faith, I was well-nigh broken, should have been fully
   Saving for one small secret relaxation,
   One that in mounting manhood had grown my hobby.

      This was to delve at whiles for easel-lumber,
   Stowed in the backmost slums of a soon-reached city,
   Merely on chance to uncloak some worthy canvas,
   Panel, or plaque, blacked blind by uncouth adventure,
   Yet under all concealing a precious art-feat.
   Such I had found not yet.  My latest capture
   Came from the rooms of a trader in ancient house-gear
   Who had no scent of beauty or soul for brushcraft.
   Only a tittle cost it -- murked with grime-films,
   Gatherings of slow years, thick-varnished over,
   Never a feature manifest of man's painting.

      So, one Saturday, time ticking hard on midnight
   Ere an hour subserved, I set me upon it.
   Long with coiled-up sleeves I cleaned and yet cleaned,
   Till a first fresh spot, a high light, looked forth,
   Then another, like fair flesh, and another;
   Then a curve, a nostril, and next a finger,
   Tapering, shapely, significantly pointing slantwise.
   "Flemish?" I said. "Nay, Spanish . . . But, nay, Italian!"
   -- Then meseemed it the guise of the ranker Venus,
   Named of some Astarte, of some Cotytto.
   Down I knelt before it and kissed the panel,
   Drunk with the lure of love's inhibited dreamings.

      Till the dawn I rubbed, when there gazed up at me
   A hag, that had slowly emerged from under my hands there,
   Pointing the slanted finger towards a bosom
   Eaten away of a rot from the lusts of a lifetime . . .
   -- I could have ended myself in heart-shook horror.
   Stunned I sat till roused by a clear-voiced bell-chime,
   Fresh and sweet as the dew-fleece under my luthern.
   It was the matin service calling to me
   From the adjacent steeple.




THE WOOD FIRE
(A FRAGMENT)


   "THIS is a brightsome blaze you've lit good friend, to-night!"
   " -- Aye, it has been the bleakest spring I have felt for years,
   And nought compares with cloven logs to keep alight:
   I buy them bargain-cheap of the executioners,
   As I dwell near; and they wanted the crosses out of sight
   By Passover, not to affront the eyes of visitors.

   "Yes, they're from the crucifixions last week-ending
   At Kranion.  We can sometimes use the poles again,
   But they get split by the nails, and 'tis quicker work than mending
   To knock together new; though the uprights now and then
   Serve twice when they're let stand.  But if a feast's impending,
   As lately, you've to tidy up for the corners' ken.

   "Though only three were impaled, you may know it didn't pass off
   So quietly as was wont?  That Galilee carpenter's son
   Who boasted he was king, incensed the rabble to scoff:
   I heard the noise from my garden.  This piece is the one he was on . . .
   Yes, it blazes up well if lit with a few dry chips and shroff;
   And it's worthless for much else, what with cuts and stains thereon."




SAYING GOOD-BYE



   WE are always saying
      "Good-bye, good-bye!"
   In work, in playing,
   In gloom, in gaying:
      At many a stage
      Of pilgrimage
      From youth to age
      We say, "Good-bye,
         Good-bye!"

   We are undiscerning
      Which go to sigh,
   Which will be yearning
   For soon returning;
      And which no more
      Will dark our door,
      Or tread our shore,
      But go to die,
         To die.

   Some come from roaming
      With joy again;
   Some, who come homing
   By stealth at gloaming,
      Had better have stopped
      Till death, and dropped
      By strange hands propped,
      Than come so fain,
         So fain.

   So, with this saying,
      "Good-bye, good-bye,"
   We speed their waying
   Without betraying
      Our grief, our fear
      No more to hear
      From them, close, clear,
      Again: "Good-bye,
         Good-bye!"




ON THE TUNE CALLED THE OLD-HUNDRED-AND-FOURTH


   WE never sang together
      Ravenscroft's terse old tune
   On Sundays or on weekdays,
   In sharp or summer weather,
      At night-time or at noon.

   Why did we never sing it,
      Why never so incline
   On Sundays or on weekdays,
   Even when soft wafts would wing it
      From your far floor to mine?

   Shall we that tune, then, never
      Stand voicing side by side
   On Sundays or on weekdays? . . .
   Or shall we, when for ever
      In Sheol we abide,

   Sing it in desolation,
      As we might long have done
   On Sundays or on weekdays
   With love and exultation
      Before our sands had run?




THE OPPORTUNITY
(FOR H. P.)


   FORTY springs back, I recall,
      We met at this phase of the Maytime:
   We might have clung close through all,
      But we parted when died that daytime.

   We parted with smallest regret;
      Perhaps should have cared but slightly,
   Just then, if we never had met:
      Strange, strange that we lived so lightly!

   Had we mused a little space
      At that critical date in the Maytime,
   One life had been ours, one place,
      Perhaps, till our long cold daytime.

   -- This is a bitter thing
      For thee, O man: what ails it?
   The tide of chance may bring
      Its offer; but nought avails it!




EVELYN G. OF CHRISTMINSTER


   I CAN see the towers
   In mind quite clear
   Not many hours'
   Faring from here;
   But how up and go,
   And briskly bear
   Thither, and know
   That are not there?

   Though the birds sing small,
   And apple and pear
   On your trees by the wall
   Are ripe and rare,
   Though none excel them,
   I have no care
   To taste them or smell them
   And you not there.

   Though the College stones
   Are smit with the sun,
   And the graduates and Dons
   Who held you as one
   Of brightest brow
   Still think as they did,
   Why haunt with them now
   Your candle is hid?

   Towards the river
   A pealing swells:
   They cost me a quiver -- 
   Those prayerful bells!
   How go to God,
   Who can reprove
   With so heavy a rod
   As your swift remove!

   The chorded keys
   Wait all in a row,
   And the bellows wheeze
   As long ago.
   And the psalter lingers,
   And organist's chair;
   But where are your fingers
   That once wagged there?

   Shall I then seek
   That desert place
   This or next week,
   And those tracks trace
   That fill me with cark
   And cloy; nowhere
   Being movement or mark
   Of you now there!




THE RIFT

   'TWAS just at gnat and cobweb-time,
   When yellow begins to show in the leaf,
   That your old gamut changed its chime
   From those true tones -- of span so brief! -- 
   That met my beats of joy, of grief,
      As rhyme meets rhyme.

   So sank I from my high sublime!
   We faced but chancewise after that,
   And never I knew or guessed my crime. . .
   Yes; 'twas the date -- or nigh thereat -- 
   Of the yellowing leaf; at moth and gnat
      And cobweb-time.




VOICES FROM THINGS GROWING IN A CHURCHYARD


   THESE flowers are I, poor Fanny Hurd,
      Sir or Madam,
   A little girl here sepultured.
   Once I flit-fluttered like a bird
   Above the grass, as now I wave
   In daisy shapes above my grave,
      All day cheerily,
      All night eerily!

   -- I am one Bachelor Bowring, "Gent,"
      Sir or Madam;
   In shingled oak my bones were pent;
   Hence more than a hundred years I spent
   In my feat of change from a coffin-thrall
   To a dancer in green as leaves on a wall.
      All day cheerily,
      All night eerily!

   -- I, these berries of juice and gloss,
      Sir or Madam,
   Am clean forgotten as Thomas Voss;
   Thin-urned, I have burrowed away from the moss
   That covers my sod, and have entered this yew,
   And turned to clusters ruddy of view,
      All day cheerily,
      All night eerily!

   -- The Lady Gertrude, proud, high-bred,
      Sir or Madam,
   Am I -- this laurel that shades your head;
   Into its veins I have stilly sped,
   And made them of me; and my leaves now shine,
   As did my satins superfine,
      All day cheerily,
      All night eerily!

   -- I, who as innocent withwind climb,
      Sir or Madam.
   Am one Eve Greensleeves, in olden time
   Kissed by men from many a clime,
   Beneath sun, stars, in blaze, in breeze,
   As now by glowworms and by bees,
      All day cheerily,
      All night eerily!

   -- I'm old Squire Audeley Grey, who grew,
      Sir or Madam,
   Aweary of life, and in scorn withdrew;
   Till anon I clambered up anew
   As ivy-green, when my ache was stayed,
   And in that attire I have longtime gayed
      All day cheerily,
      All night eerily!

   -- And so they breathe, these masks, to each
      Sir or Madam
   Who lingers there, and their lively speech
   Affords an interpreter much to teach,
   As their murmurous accents seem to come
   Thence hitheraround in a radiant hum,
      All day cheerily,
      All night eerily!




ON THE WAY


      THE trees fret fitfully and twist,
      Shutters rattle and carpets heave,
      Slime is the dust of yestereve,
         And in the streaming mist
   Fishes might seem to fin a passage if they list.

            But to his feet,
            Drawing nigh and nigher
            A hidden seat,
            The fog is sweet
            And the wind a lyre.

      A vacant sameness grays the sky,
      A moisture gathers on each knop
      Of the bramble, rounding to a drop,
         That greets the goer-by
   With the cold listless lustre of a dead man's eye.

            But to her sight,
            Drawing nigh and nigher
            Its deep delight,
            The fog is bright
            And the wind a lyre.




"SHE DID NOT TURN"


      SHE did not turn,
   But passed foot-faint with averted head
   In her gown of green, by the bobbing fern,
   Though I leaned over the gate that led
   From where we waited with table spread;
         But she did not turn:
   Why was she near there if love had fled?

      She did not turn,
   Though the gate was whence I had often sped
   In the mists of morning to meet her, and learn
   Her heart, when its moving moods I read
   As a book -- she mine, as she sometimes said;
         But she did not turn,
   And passed foot-faint with averted head.




GROWTH IN MAY


   I ENTER a daisy-and-buttercup land,
      And thence thread a jungle of grass:
   Hurdles and stiles scarce visible stand
      Above the lush stems as I pass.

   Hedges peer over, and try to be seen,
      And seem to reveal a dim sense
   That amid such ambitious and elbow-high green
      They make a mean show as a fence.

   Elsewhere the mead is possessed of the neats,
      That range not greatly above
   The rich rank thicket which brushes their teats,
      And -- her -- gown, as she waits for her Love.

NEAR CHARD.




THE CHILDREN AND SIR NAMELESS


   Sir Nameless, once of Athelhall, declared:
   "These wretched children romping in my park
   Trample the herbage till the soil is bared,
   And yap and yell from early morn till dark!
   Go keep them harnessed to their set routines:
   Thank God I've none to hasten my decay;
   For green remembrance there are better means
   Than offspring, who but wish their sires away."

   Sir Nameless of that mansion said anon:
   "To be perpetuate for my mightiness
   Sculpture must image me when I am gone."
   -- He forthwith summoned carvers there express
   To shape a figure stretching seven-odd feet
   (For he was tall) in alabaster stone,
   With shield, and crest, and casque, and word complete:
   When done a statelier work was never known.

   Three hundred years hied; Church-restorers came,
   And, no one of his lineage being traced,
   They thought an effigy so large in frame
   Best fitted for the floor.  There it was placed,
   Under the seats for schoolchildren.  And they
   Kicked out his name, and hobnailed off his nose;
   And, as they yawn through sermon-time, they say,
   "Who was this old stone man beneath our toes?"




AT THE ROYAL ACADEMY


   THESE summer landscapes -- clump, and copse, and croft -- 
   Woodland and meadowland -- here hung aloft,
   Gay with limp grass and leafery new and soft,

   Seem caught from the immediate season's yield
   I saw last noonday shining over the field,
   By rapid snatch, while still are uncongealed

   The saps that in their live originals climb;
   Yester's quick greenage here set forth in mime
   Just as it stands, now, at our breathing-time.

   But these young foils so fresh upon each tree,
   Soft verdures spread in sprouting novelty,
   Are not this summer's, though they feign to be.

   Last year their May to Michaelmas term was run,
   Last autumn browned and buried every one,
   And no more know they sight of any sun.




HER TEMPLE


   DEAR, think not that they will forget you:
      -- If craftsmanly art should be mine
   I will build up a temple, and set you
         Therein as its shrine.

   They may say: "Why a woman such honour?"
      -- Be told, "O, so sweet was her fame,
   That a man heaped this splendour upon her;
         None now knows his name."




A TWO-YEARS' IDYLL


         YES; such it was;
      Just those two seasons unsought,
   Sweeping like summertide wind on our ways;
         Moving, as straws,
      Hearts quick as ours in those days;
   Going like wind, too, and rated as nought
      Save as the prelude to plays
      Soon to come -- larger, life-fraught:
         Yes; such it was.

         "Nought" it was called,
      Even by ourselves -- that which springs
   Out of the years for all flesh, first or last,
         Commonplace, scrawled
      Dully on days that go past.
   Yet, all the while, it upbore us like wings
      Even in hours overcast:
      Aye, though this best thing of things,
         "Nought" it was called!

         What seems it now?
      Lost: such beginning was all;
   Nothing came after: romance straight forsook
         Quickly somehow
      Life when we sped from our nook,
   Primed for new scenes with designs smart and tall . . .
      -- A preface without any book,
      A trumpet uplipped, but no call;
         That seems it now.




BY HENSTRIDGE CROSS AT THE YEAR'S END


(From this centuries-old cross-road the highway leads east to London,
north to Bristol and Bath, west to Exeter and the Land's End, and south
to the Channel coast.)

      WHY go the east road now? . . .
   That way a youth went on a morrow
   After mirth, and he brought back sorrow
      Painted upon his brow
      Why go the east road now?

      Why go the north road now?
   Torn, leaf-strewn, as if scoured by foemen,
   Once edging fiefs of my forefolk yeomen,
      Fallows fat to the plough:
      Why go the north road now?

      Why go the west road now?
   Thence to us came she, bosom-burning,
   Welcome with joyousness returning . . .
      -- She sleeps under the bough:
      Why go the west road now?

      Why go the south road now?
   That way marched they some are forgetting,
   Stark to the moon left, past regretting
      Loves who have falsed their vow . . .
      Why go the south road now?

      Why go any road now?
   White stands the handpost for brisk on-bearers,
   "Halt!" is the word for wan-cheeked farers
      Musing on Whither, and How . . .
      Why go any road now?

      "Yea: we want new feet now"
   Answer the stones.  "Want chit-chat, laughter:
   Plenty of such to go hereafter
      By our tracks, we trow!
      We are for new feet now."

 -- During the War -- .




PENANCE


   "WHY do you sit, O pale thin man,
      At the end of the room
   By that harpsichord, built on the quaint old plan?
      -- It is cold as a tomb,
   And there's not a spark within the grate;
      And the jingling wires
      Are as vain desires
      That have lagged too late."

   "Why do I?  Alas, far times ago
      A woman lyred here
   In the evenfall; one who fain did so
      From year to year;
   And, in loneliness bending wistfully,
      Would wake each note
      In sick sad rote,
      None to listen or see!

   "I would not join.  I would not stay,
      But drew away,
   Though the winter fire beamed brightly . . . Aye!
      I do to-day
   What I would not then; and the chill old keys,
      Like a skull's brown teeth
      Loose in their sheath,
      Freeze my touch; yes, freeze."




"I LOOK IN HER FACE"

   I LOOK in her face and say,
   "Sing as you used to sing
   About Love's blossoming";
   But she hints not Yea or Nay.

   "Sing, then, that Love's a pain,
   If, Dear, you think it so,
   Whether it be or no;"
   But dumb her lips remain.

   I go to a far-off room,
   A faint song ghosts my ear;
   -- Which -- song I cannot hear,
   But it seems to come from a tomb.




AFTER THE WAR


   LAST Post sounded
   Across the mead
   To where he loitered
   With absent heed.
   Five years before
   In the evening there
   Had flown that call
   To him and his Dear.
   "You'll never come back;
   Good-bye!" she had said;
   "Here I'll be living,
   And my Love dead!"

   Those closing minims
   Had been as shafts darting
   Through him and her pressed
   In that last parting;
   They thrilled him not now,
   In the selfsame place
   With the selfsame sun
   On his war-seamed face.
   "Lurks a god's laughter
   In this?" he said,
   "That I am the living
   And she the dead!"




"IF YOU HAD KNOWN"


      IF you had known
   When listening with her to the far-down moan
   Of the white-selvaged and empurpled sea,
   And rain came on that did not hinder talk,
   Or damp your flashing facile gaiety
   In turning home, despite the slow wet walk
   By crooked ways, and over stiles of stone;
      If you had known

      You would lay roses,
   Fifty years thence, on her monument, that discloses
   Its graying shape upon the luxuriant green;
   Fifty years thence to an hour, by chance led there,
   What might have moved you? -- yea, had you foreseen
   That on the tomb of the selfsame one, gone where
   The dawn of every day is as the close is,
      You would lay roses!




THE CHAPEL-ORGANIST


   I'VE been thinking it through, as I play here to-night, to play never
   again,
   By the light of that lowering sun peering in at the window-pane,
   And over the back-street roofs, throwing shades from the boys of the
   chore
   In the gallery, right upon me, sitting up to these keys once more . . .

   How I used to hear tongues ask, as I sat here when I was new:
   "Who is she playing the organ?  She touches it mightily true!"
   "She travels from Havenpool Town," the deacon would softly speak,
   "The stipend can hardly cover her fare hither twice in the week."
   (It fell far short of doing, indeed; but I never told,
   For I have craved minstrelsy more than lovers, or beauty, or gold.)

   'Twas so he answered at first, but the story grew different later:
   "It cannot go on much longer, from what we hear of her now!"
   At the meaning wheeze in the words the inquirer would shift his place
   Till he could see round the curtain that screened me from people
   below.
   "A handsome girl," he would murmur, upstaring, (and so I am).
   "But -- too much sex in her build; fine eyes, but eyelids too heavy;
   A bosom too full for her age; in her lips too voluptuous a look."
   (It may be.  But who put it there?  Assuredly it was not I.)

   I went on playing and singing when this I had heard, and more,
   Though tears half-blinded me; yes, I remained going on and on,
   Just as I used me to chord and to sing at the selfsame time! . . .
   For it's a contralto -- my voice is; they'll hear it again here to-night
   In the psalmody notes that I love more than world or than flesh or
   than life.

   Well, the deacon, in fact, that day had learnt new tidings about me;
   They troubled his mind not a little, for he was a worthy man.
   (He trades as a chemist in High Street, and during the week he had
   sought
   His fellow-deacon, who throve as a book-binder over the way.)
   "These are strange rumours," he said.  "We must guard the good name of
   the chapel.
   If, sooth, she's of evil report, what else can we do but dismiss her?"
   " -- But get such another to play here we cannot for double the price!"
   It settled the point for the time, and I triumphed awhile in their
   strait,
   And my much-beloved grand semibreves went living on under my fingers.

   At length in the congregation more head-shakes and murmurs were rife,
   And my dismissal was ruled, though I was not warned of it then.
   But a day came when they declared it.  The news entered me as a sword;
   I was broken; so pallid of face that they thought I should faint, they
   said.
   I rallied.  "O, rather than go, I will play you for nothing!" said I.
   'Twas in much desperation I spoke it, for bring me to forfeit I could
   not
   Those melodies chorded so richly for which I had laboured and lived.
   They paused.  And for nothing I played at the chapel through Sundays
   anon,
   Upheld by that art which I loved more than blandishments lavished of
   men.

   But it fell that murmurs again from the flock broke the pastor's
   peace.
   Some member had seen me at Havenpool, comrading close a sea-captain.
   (Yes; I was thereto constrained, lacking means for the fare to and
   fro.)
   Yet God knows, if aught He knows ever, I loved the Old-Hundredth,
   Saint Stephen's,
   Mount Zion, New Sabbath, Miles-Lane, Holy Rest, and Arabia, and Eaton,
   Above all embraces of body by wooers who sought me and won! . . .
   Next week 'twas declared I was seen coming home with a lover at dawn.
   The deacons insisted then, strong; and forgiveness I did not implore.
   I saw all was lost for me, quite, but I made a last bid in my throbs.
   High love had been beaten by lust; and the senses had conquered the
   soul,
   But the soul should die game, if I knew it!  I turned to my masters
   and said:
   "I yield, Gentlemen, without parlance.  But -- let me just hymn you
   -- once -- more!
   It's a little thing, Sirs, that I ask; and a passion is music with
   me!"
   They saw that consent would cost nothing, and show as good grace, as
   knew I,
   Though tremble I did, and feel sick, as I paused thereat, dumb for
   their words.
   They gloomily nodded assent, saying, "Yes, if you care to.  Once more,
   And only once more, understand."  To that with a bend I agreed.
   -- "You've a fixed and a far-reaching look," spoke one who had eyed me
   awhile.
   "I've a fixed and a far-reaching plan, and my look only showed it,"
   said I.

   This evening of Sunday is come -- the last of my functioning here.
   "She plays as if she were possessed!" they exclaim, glancing upward
   and round.
   "Such harmonies I never dreamt the old instrument capable of!"
   Meantime the sun lowers and goes; shades deepen; the lights are turned
   up,
   And the people voice out the last singing: tune Tallis: the Evening
   Hymn.
   (I wonder Dissenters sing Ken: it shows them more liberal in spirit
   At this little chapel down here than at certain new others I know.)
   I sing as I play.  Murmurs some one: "No woman's throat richer than
   hers!"
   "True: in these parts, at least," ponder I.  "But, my man, you will
   hear it no more."
   And I sing with them onward: "The grave dread as little do I as my
   bed."

   I lift up my feet from the pedals; and then, while my eyes are still
   wet
   From the symphonies born of my fingers, I do that whereon I am set,
   And draw from my "full round bosom," (their words; how can -- I -- help
   its heave?)
   A bottle blue-coloured and fluted -- a vinaigrette, they may conceive -- 
   And before the choir measures my meaning, reads aught in my moves to
   and fro,
   I drink from the phial at a draught, and they think it a pick-me-up;
   so.
   Then I gather my books as to leave, bend over the keys as to pray.
   When they come to me motionless, stooping, quick death will have
   whisked me away.

   "Sure, nobody meant her to poison herself in her haste, after all!"
   The deacons will say as they carry me down and the night shadows fall,
   "Though the charges were true," they will add.  "It's a case red as
   scarlet withal!"
   I have never once minced it.  Lived chaste I have not.  Heaven knows
   it above! . . .
   But past all the heavings of passion -- it's music has been my life-love! . . .
   That tune did go well -- this last playing! . . . I reckon they'll bury
   me here . . .
   Not a soul from the seaport my birthplace -- will come, or bestow me . . .
   a tear.




FETCHING HER


      AN hour before the dawn,
            My friend,
   You lit your waiting bedside-lamp,
      Your breakfast-fire anon,
   And outing into the dark and damp
      You saddled, and set on.

      Thuswise, before the day,
            My friend,
   You sought her on her surfy shore,
      To fetch her thence away
   Unto your own new-builded door
      For a staunch lifelong stay.

      You said: "It seems to be,
            My friend,
   That I were bringing to my place
      The pure brine breeze, the sea,
   The mews -- all her old sky and space,
      In bringing her with me!"

      -- But time is prompt to expugn,
            My friend,
   Such magic-minted conjurings:
      The brought breeze fainted soon,
   And then the sense of seamews' wings,
      And the shore's sibilant tune.

      So, it had been more due,
            My friend,
   Perhaps, had you not pulled this flower
      From the craggy nook it knew,
   And set it in an alien bower;
      But left it where it grew!




"COULD I BUT WILL"


         COULD I but will,
         Will to my bent,
   I'd have afar ones near me still,
   And music of rare ravishment,
   In strains that move the toes and heels!
   And when the sweethearts sat for rest
   The unbetrothed should foot with zest
         Ecstatic reels.

         Could I be head,
         Head-god, "Come, now,
   Dear girl," I'd say, "whose flame is fled,
   Who liest with linen-banded brow,
   Stirred but by shakes from Earth's deep core -- "
   I'd say to her: "Unshroud and meet
   That Love who kissed and called thee Sweet! -- 
         Yea, come once more!"

         Even half-god power
         In spinning dooms
   Had I, this frozen scene should flower,
   And sand-swept plains and Arctic glooms
   Should green them gay with waving leaves,
   Mid which old friends and I would walk
   With weightless feet and magic talk
         Uncounted eves.




SHE REVISITS ALONE THE CHURCH OF HER MARRIAGE


   I HAVE come to the church and chancel,
      Where all's the same!
   -- Brighter and larger in my dreams
   Truly it shaped than now, meseems,
      Is its substantial frame.
   But, anyhow, I made my vow,
      Whether for praise or blame,
   Here in this church and chancel
      Where all's the same.

   Where touched the check-floored chancel
      My knees and his?
   The step looks shyly at the sun,
   And says, "'Twas here the thing was done,
      For bale or else for bliss!"
   Of all those there I least was ware
      Would it be that or this
   When touched the check-floored chancel
      My knees and his!

   Here in this fateful chancel
      Where all's the same,
   I thought the culminant crest of life
   Was reached when I went forth the wife
      I was not when I came.
   Each commonplace one of my race,
      Some say, has such an aim -- 
   To go from a fateful chancel
      As not the same.

   Here, through this hoary chancel
      Where all's the same,
   A thrill, a gaiety even, ranged
   That morning when it seemed I changed
      My nature with my name.
   Though now not fair, though gray my hair,
      He loved me, past proclaim,
   Here in this hoary chancel,
      Where all's the same.




AT THE ENTERING OF THE NEW YEAR


I
(OLD STYLE)


   OUR songs went up and out the chimney,
   And roused the home-gone husbandmen;
   Our allemands, our heys, poussettings,
   Our hands-across and back again,
   Sent rhythmic throbbings through the casements
      On to the white highway,
   Where nighted farers paused and muttered,
      "Keep it up well, do they!"

   The contrabasso's measured booming
   Sped at each bar to the parish bounds,
   To shepherds at their midnight lambings,
   To stealthy poachers on their rounds;
   And everybody caught full duly
      The notes of our delight,
   As Time unrobed the Youth of Promise
      Hailed by our sanguine sight.



II
(NEW STYLE)


      WE stand in the dusk of a pine-tree limb,
      As if to give ear to the muffled peal,
      Brought or withheld at the breeze's whim;
      But our truest heed is to words that steal
      From the mantled ghost that looms in the gray,
      And seems, so far as our sense can see,
      To feature bereaved Humanity,
      As it sighs to the imminent year its say: -- 

      "O stay without, O stay without,
      Calm comely Youth, untasked, untired;
      Though stars irradiate thee about
      Thy entrance here is undesired.
      Open the gate not, mystic one;
   Must we avow what we would close confine?
   -- With thee -- , -- good friend -- , -- we would have converse none -- ,
      Albeit the fault may not be thine."




THEY WOULD NOT COME


   I TRAVELLED to where in her lifetime
      She'd knelt at morning prayer,
      To call her up as if there;
   But she paid no heed to my suing,
   As though her old haunt could win not
      A thought from her spirit, or care.

   I went where my friend had lectioned
      The prophets in high declaim,
      That my soul's ear the same
   Full tones should catch as aforetime;
   But silenced by gear of the Present
      Was the voice that once there came!

   Where the ocean had sprayed our banquet
      I stood, to recall it as then:
      The same eluding again!
   No vision.  Shows contingent
   Affrighted it further from me
      Even than from my home-den.

   When I found them no responders,
      But fugitives prone to flee
      From where they had used to be,
   It vouched I had been led hither
   As by night wisps in bogland,
      And bruised the heart of me!




AFTER A ROMANTIC DAY


      THE railway bore him through
         An earthen cutting out from a city:
      There was no scope for view,
   Though the frail light shed by a slim young moon
      Fell like a friendly tune.

      Fell like a liquid ditty,
   And the blank lack of any charm
      Of landscape did no harm.
   The bald steep cutting, rigid, rough,
      And moon-lit, was enough
   For poetry of place: its weathered face
   Formed a convenient sheet whereon
   The visions of his mind were drawn.




THE TWO WIVES
(SMOKER'S CLUB-STORY)


   I WAITED at home all the while they were boating together -- 
         My wife and my near neighbour's wife:
      Till there entered a woman I loved more than life,
   And we sat and sat on, and beheld the uprising dark weather,
         With a sense that some mischief was rife.

   Tidings came that the boat had capsized, and that one of the ladies
         Was drowned -- which of them was unknown:
      And I marvelled -- my friend's wife? -- or was it my own
   Who had gone in such wise to the land where the sun as the shade is?
         -- We learnt it was -- his -- had so gone.

   Then I cried in unrest: "He is free!  But no good is releasing
         To him as it would be to me!"
      " -- But it is," said the woman I loved, quietly.
   "How?" I asked her.  " -- Because he has long loved me too without
   ceasing,
         And it's just the same thing, don't you see."




"I KNEW A LADY"
(CLUB SONG)


   I KNEW a lady when the days
      Grew long, and evenings goldened;
      But I was not emboldened
   By her prompt eyes and winning ways.

   And when old Winter nipt the haws,
      "Another's wife I'll be,
      And then you'll care for me,"
   She said, "and think how sweet I was!"

   And soon she shone as another's wife:
      As such I often met her,
      And sighed, "How I regret her!
   My folly cuts me like a knife!"

   And then, to-day, her husband came,
      And moaned, "Why did you flout her?
      Well could I do without her!
   For both our burdens you are to blame!"




A HOUSE WITH A HISTORY


   THERE is a house in a city street
      Some past ones made their own;
   Its floors were criss-crossed by their feet,
         And their babblings beat
      From ceiling to white hearth-stone.

   And who are peopling its parlours now?
      Who talk across its floor?
   Mere freshlings are they, blank of brow,
         Who read not how
      Its prime had passed before

   Their raw equipments, scenes, and says
      Afflicted its memoried face,
   That had seen every larger phase
         Of human ways
      Before these filled the place.

   To them that house's tale is theirs,
      No former voices call
   Aloud therein.  Its aspect bears
         Their joys and cares
      Alone, from wall to wall.




A PROCESSION OF DEAD DAYS


   I SEE the ghost of a perished day;
   I know his face, and the feel of his dawn:
   'Twas he who took me far away
      To a spot strange and gray:
   Look at me, Day, and then pass on,
   But come again: yes, come anon!

   Enters another into view;
   His features are not cold or white,
   But rosy as a vein seen through:
      Too soon he smiles adieu.
   Adieu, O ghost-day of delight;
   But come and grace my dying sight.

   Enters the day that brought the kiss:
   He brought it in his foggy hand
   To where the mumbling river is,
      And the high clematis;
   It lent new colour to the land,
   And all the boy within me manned.

   Ah, this one.  Yes, I know his name,
   He is the day that wrought a shine
   Even on a precinct common and tame,
      As 'twere of purposed aim.
   He shows him as a rainbow sign
   Of promise made to me and mine.

   The next stands forth in his morning clothes,
   And yet, despite their misty blue,
   They mark no sombre custom-growths
      That joyous living loathes,
   But a meteor act, that left in its queue
   A train of sparks my lifetime through.

   I almost tremble at his nod -- 
   This next in train -- who looks at me
   As I were slave, and he were god
      Wielding an iron rod.
   I close my eyes; yet still is he
   In front there, looking mastery.

   In the similitude of a nurse
   The phantom of the next one comes:
   I did not know what better or worse
      Chancings might bless or curse
   When his original glossed the thrums
   Of ivy, bringing that which numbs.

   Yes; trees were turning in their sleep
   Upon their windy pillows of gray
   When he stole in.  Silent his creep
      On the grassed eastern steep . . .
   I shall not soon forget that day,
   And what his third hour took away!




HE FOLLOWS HIMSELF


   IN a heavy time I dogged myself
      Along a louring way,
   Till my leading self to my following self
      Said: "Why do you hang on me
         So harassingly?"

   "I have watched you, Heart of mine," I cried,
      "So often going astray
   And leaving me, that I have pursued,
      Feeling such truancy
         Ought not to be."

   He said no more, and I dogged him on
      From noon to the dun of day
   By prowling paths, until anew
      He begged: "Please turn and flee! -- 
         What do you see?"

   "Methinks I see a man," said I,
      "Dimming his hours to gray.
   I will not leave him while I know
      Part of myself is he
         Who dreams such dree!"

   "I go to my old friend's house," he urged,
      "So do not watch me, pray!"
   "Well, I will leave you in peace," said I,
      "Though of this poignancy
         You should fight free:

   "Your friend, O other me, is dead;
      You know not what you say."
   -- "That do I!  And at his green-grassed door
      By night's bright galaxy
         I bend a knee."

   -- The yew-plumes moved like mockers' beards,
      Though only boughs were they,
   And I seemed to go; yet still was there,
      And am, and there haunt we
         Thus bootlessly.




THE SINGING WOMAN


      THERE was a singing woman
         Came riding across the mead
      At the time of the mild May weather,
            Tameless, tireless;
   This song she sung: "I am fair, I am young!"
         And many turned to heed.

      And the same singing woman
         Sat crooning in her need
      At the time of the winter weather;
            Friendless, fireless,
   She sang this song: "Life, thou'rt too long!"
         And there was none to heed.




WITHOUT, NOT WITHIN HER


   IT was what you bore with you, Woman,
      Not inly were,
   That throned you from all else human,
      However fair!

   It was that strange freshness you carried
      Into a soul
   Whereon no thought of yours tarried
      Two moments at all.

   And out from his spirit flew death,
      And bale, and ban,
   Like the corn-chaff under the breath
      Of the winnowing-fan.




"O I WON'T LEAD A HOMELY LIFE"
( -- To an old air -- )


   "O I won't lead a homely life
   As father's Jack and mother's Jill,
   But I will be a fiddler's wife,
      With music mine at will!
         Just a little tune,
         Another one soon,
      As I merrily fling my fill!"

   And she became a fiddler's Dear,
   And merry all day she strove to be;
   And he played and played afar and near,
      But never at home played he
         Any little tune
         Or late or soon;
      And sunk and sad was she!




IN THE SMALL HOURS


   I LAY in my bed and fiddled
      With a dreamland viol and bow,
   And the tunes flew back to my fingers
      I had melodied years ago.
   It was two or three in the morning
      When I fancy-fiddled so
   Long reels and country-dances,
      And hornpipes swift and slow.

   And soon anon came crossing
      The chamber in the gray
   Figures of jigging fieldfolk -- 
      Saviours of corn and hay -- 
   To the air of "Haste to the Wedding,"
      As after a wedding-day;
   Yea, up and down the middle
      In windless whirls went they!

   There danced the bride and bridegroom,
      And couples in a train,
   Gay partners time and travail
      Had longwhiles stilled amain! . . .
   It seemed a thing for weeping
      To find, at slumber's wane
   And morning's sly increeping,
      That Now, not Then, held reign.




THE LITTLE OLD TABLE


   CREAK, little wood thing, creak,
   When I touch you with elbow or knee;
   That is the way you speak
   Of one who gave you to me!

   You, little table, she brought -- 
   Brought me with her own hand,
   As she looked at me with a thought
   That I did not understand.

   -- Whoever owns it anon,
   And hears it, will never know
   What a history hangs upon
   This creak from long ago.




VAGG HOLLOW


Vagg Hollow is a marshy spot on the old Roman Road near Ilchester, where
"things" are seen.  Merchandise was formerly fetched inland from the
canal-boats at Load-Bridge by waggons this way.

   "WHAT do you see in Vagg Hollow,
   Little boy, when you go
   In the morning at five on your lonely drive?"
   " -- I see men's souls, who follow
   Till we've passed where the road lies low,
   When they vanish at our creaking!

   "They are like white faces speaking
   Beside and behind the waggon -- 
   One just as father's was when here.
   The waggoner drinks from his flagon,
   (Or he'd flinch when the Hollow is near)
   But he does not give me any.

   "Sometimes the faces are many;
   But I walk along by the horses,
   He asleep on the straw as we jog;
   And I hear the loud water-courses,
   And the drops from the trees in the fog,
   And watch till the day is breaking.

   "And the wind out by Tintinhull waking;
   I hear in it father's call
   As he called when I saw him dying,
   And he sat by the fire last Fall,
   And mother stood by sighing;
   But I'm not afraid at all!"




THE DREAM IS -- WHICH?


   I AM laughing by the brook with her,
      Splashed in its tumbling stir;
   And then it is a blankness looms
      As if I walked not there,
   Nor she, but found me in haggard rooms,
      And treading a lonely stair.

   With radiant cheeks and rapid eyes
      We sit where none espies;
   Till a harsh change comes edging in
      As no such scene were there,
   But winter, and I were bent and thin,
      And cinder-gray my hair.

   We dance in heys around the hall,
      Weightless as thistleball;
   And then a curtain drops between,
      As if I danced not there,
   But wandered through a mounded green
      To find her, I knew where.




THE COUNTRY WEDDING
(A FIDDLER'S STORY)


   LITTLE fogs were gathered in every hollow,
   But the purple hillocks enjoyed fine weather
   As we marched with our fiddles over the heather
   -- How it comes back! -- to their wedding that day.

   Our getting there brought our neighbours and all, O!
   Till, two and two, the couples stood ready.
   And her father said: "Souls, for God's sake, be steady!"
   And we strung up our fiddles, and sounded out "A."

   The groomsman he stared, and said, "You must follow!"
   But we'd gone to fiddle in front of the party,
   (Our feelings as friends being true and hearty)
   And fiddle in front we did -- all the way.

   Yes, from their door by Mill-tail-Shallow,
   And up Styles-Lane, and by Front-Street houses,
   Where stood maids, bachelors, and spouses,
   Who cheered the songs that we knew how to play.

   I bowed the treble before her father,
   Michael the tenor in front of the lady,
   The bass-viol Reub -- and right well played he! -- 
   The serpent Jim; ay, to church and back.

   I thought the bridegroom was flurried rather,
   As we kept up the tune outside the chancel,
   While they were swearing things none can cancel
   Inside the walls to our drumstick's whack.

   "Too gay!" she pleaded.  "Clouds may gather,
   And sorrow come."  But she gave in, laughing,
   And by supper-time when we'd got to the quaffing
   Her fears were forgot, and her smiles weren't slack.

   A grand wedding 'twas!  And what would follow
   We never thought.  Or that we should have buried her
   On the same day with the man that married her,
   A day like the first, half hazy, half clear.

   Yes: little fogs were in every hollow,
   Though the purple hillocks enjoyed fine weather,
   When we went to play 'em to church together,
   And carried 'em there in an after year.




FIRST OR LAST



      IF grief come early
      Joy comes late,
      If joy come early
      Grief will wait;
         Aye, my dear and tender!

   Wise ones joy them early
   While the cheeks are red,
   Banish grief till surly
   Time has dulled their dread.

      And joy being ours
      Ere youth has flown,
      The later hours
      May find us gone;
         Aye, my dear and tender!




LONELY DAYS


   LONELY her fate was,
   Environed from sight
   In the house where the gate was
   Past finding at night.
   None there to share it,
   No one to tell:
   Long she'd to bear it,
   And bore it well.

   Elsewhere just so she
   Spent many a day;
   Wishing to go she
   Continued to stay.
   And people without
   Basked warm in the air,
   But none sought her out,
   Or knew she was there.
   Even birthdays were passed so,
   Sunny and shady:
   Years did it last so
   For this sad lady.
   Never declaring it,
   No one to tell,
   Still she kept bearing it -- 
   Bore it well.

   The days grew chillier,
   And then she went
   To a city, familiar
   In years forespent,
   When she walked gaily
   Far to and fro,
   But now, moving frailly,
   Could nowhere go.
   The cheerful colour
   Of houses she'd known
   Had died to a duller
   And dingier tone.
   Streets were now noisy
   Where once had rolled
   A few quiet coaches,
   Or citizens strolled.
   Through the party-wall
   Of the memoried spot
   They danced at a ball
   Who recalled her not.
   Tramlines lay crossing
   Once gravelled slopes,
   Metal rods clanked,
   And electric ropes.
   So she endured it all,
   Thin, thinner wrought,
   Until time cured it all,
   And she knew nought.

Versified from a Diary.




"WHAT DID IT MEAN?"


   What did it mean that noontide, when
   You bade me pluck the flower
   Within the other woman's bower,
      Whom I knew nought of then?

   I thought the flower blushed deeplier -- aye,
   And as I drew its stalk to me
   It seemed to breathe: "I am, I see,
   Made use of in a human play."

   And while I plucked, upstarted sheer
   As phantom from the pane thereby
   A corpse-like countenance, with eye
   That iced me by its baleful peer -- 
      Silent, as from a bier . . .

   When I came back your face had changed,
      It was no face for me;
   O did it speak of hearts estranged,
      And deadly rivalry

      In times before
      I darked your door,
      To seise me of
      Mere second love,
   Which still the haunting first deranged?




AT THE DINNER-TABLE


   I SAT at dinner in my prime,
   And glimpsed my face in the sideboard-glass,
   And started as if I had seen a crime,
   And prayed the ghastly show might pass.

   Wrenched wrinkled features met my sight,
   Grinning back to me as my own;
   I well-nigh fainted with affright
   At finding me a haggard crone.

   My husband laughed.  He had slily set
   A warping mirror there, in whim
   To startle me.  My eyes grew wet;
   I spoke not all the eve to him.

   He was sorry, he said, for what he had done,
   And took away the distorting glass,
   Uncovering the accustomed one;
   And so it ended?  No, alas,

   Fifty years later, when he died,
   I sat me in the selfsame chair,
   Thinking of him.  Till, weary-eyed,
   I saw the sideboard facing there;

   And from its mirror looked the lean
   Thing I'd become, each wrinkle and score
   The image of me that I had seen
   In jest there fifty years before.




THE MARBLE TABLET


   THERE it stands, though alas, what a little of her
      Shows in its cold white look!
   Not her glance, glide, or smile; not a tittle of her
      Voice like the purl of a brook;
      Not her thoughts, that you read like a book.

   It may stand for her once in November
      When first she breathed, witless of all;
   Or in heavy years she would remember
      When circumstance held her in thrall;
      Or at last, when she answered her call!

   Nothing more.  The still marble, date-graven,
      Gives all that it can, tersely lined;
   That one has at length found the haven
      Which every one other will find;
      With silence on what shone behind.


THE MASTER AND THE LEAVES


                 

   WE are budding, Master, budding,
      We of your favourite tree;
   March drought and April flooding
      Arouse us merrily,
   Our stemlets newly studding;
      And yet you do not see!

                               

   We are fully woven for summer
      In stuff of limpest green,
   The twitterer and the hummer
      Here rest of nights, unseen,
   While like a long-roll drummer
      The nightjar thrills the treen.

                              

   We are turning yellow, Master,
      And next we are turning red,
   And faster then and faster
      Shall seek our rooty bed,
   All wasted in disaster!
      But you lift not your head.

  

   -- "I mark your early going,
      And that you'll soon be clay,
   I have seen your summer showing
      As in my youthful day;
   But why I seem unknowing
      Is too sunk in to say!"





LAST WORDS TO A DUMB FRIEND


   PET was never mourned as you,
   Purrer of the spotless hue,
   Plumy tail, and wistful gaze
   While you humoured our queer ways,
   Or outshrilled your morning call
   Up the stairs and through the hall -- 
   Foot suspended in its fall -- 
   While, expectant, you would stand
   Arched, to meet the stroking hand;
   Till your way you chose to wend
   Yonder, to your tragic end.

   Never another pet for me!
   Let your place all vacant be;
   Better blankness day by day
   Than companion torn away.
   Better bid his memory fade,
   Better blot each mark he made,
   Selfishly escape distress
   By contrived forgetfulness,
   Than preserve his prints to make
   Every morn and eve an ache.

   From the chair whereon he sat
   Sweep his fur, nor wince thereat;
   Rake his little pathways out
   Mid the bushes roundabout;
   Smooth away his talons' mark
   From the claw-worn pine-tree bark,
   Where he climbed as dusk embrowned,
   Waiting us who loitered round.

   Strange it is this speechless thing,
   Subject to our mastering,
   Subject for his life and food
   To our gift, and time, and mood;
   Timid pensioner of us Powers,
   His existence ruled by ours,
   Should -- by crossing at a breath
   Into safe and shielded death,
   By the merely taking hence
   Of his insignificance -- 
   Loom as largened to the sense,
   Shape as part, above man's will,
   Of the Imperturbable.

   As a prisoner, flight debarred,
   Exercising in a yard,
   Still retain I, troubled, shaken,
   Mean estate, by him forsaken;
   And this home, which scarcely took
   Impress from his little look,
   By his faring to the Dim
   Grows all eloquent of him.

   Housemate, I can think you still
   Bounding to the window-sill,
   Over which I vaguely see
   Your small mound beneath the tree,
   Showing in the autumn shade
   That you moulder where you played.





A DRIZZLING EASTER MORNING


   AND he is risen?  Well, be it so . . .
   And still the pensive lands complain,
   And dead men wait as long ago,
   As if, much doubting, they would know
   What they are ransomed from, before
   They pass again their sheltering door.

   I stand amid them in the rain,
   While blusters vex the yew and vane;
   And on the road the weary wain
   Plods forward, laden heavily;
   And toilers with their aches are fain
   For endless rest -- though risen is he.




ON ONE WHO LIVED AND DIED WHERE HE WAS BORN


   WHEN a night in November
      Blew forth its bleared airs
   An infant descended
      His birth-chamber stairs
      For the very first time,
      At the still, midnight chime;
   All unapprehended
      His mission, his aim. -- 
   Thus, first, one November,
   An infant descended
      The stairs.

   On a night in November
      Of weariful cares,
   A frail aged figure
      Ascended those stairs
      For the very last time:
      All gone his life's prime,
   All vanished his vigour,
      And fine, forceful frame:
   Thus, last, one November
   Ascended that figure
      Upstairs.

   On those nights in November -- 
      Apart eighty years -- 
   The babe and the bent one
      Who traversed those stairs
      From the early first time
      To the last feeble climb -- 
   That fresh and that spent one -- 
      Were even the same:
   Yea, who passed in November
   As infant, as bent one,
         Those stairs.

   Wise child of November!
      From birth to blanched hairs
   Descending, ascending,
      Wealth-wantless, those stairs;
      Who saw quick in time
      As a vain pantomime
   Life's tending, its ending,
      The worth of its fame.
   Wise child of November,
   Descending, ascending
         Those stairs!




THE SECOND NIGHT
(BALLAD)


   I MISSED one night, but the next I went;
      It was gusty above, and clear;
   She was there, with the look of one ill-content,
      And said: "Do not come near!"

   -- "I am sorry last night to have failed you here,
      And now I have travelled all day;
   And it's long rowing back to the West-Hoe Pier,
      So brief must be my stay."

   -- "O man of mystery, why not say
      Out plain to me all you mean?
   Why you missed last night, and must now away
      Is -- another has come between!"

   -- "O woman so mocking in mood and mien,
      So be it!" I replied:
   "And if I am due at a differing scene
      Before the dark has died,

   "'Tis that, unresting, to wander wide
      Has ever been my plight,
   And at least I have met you at Cremyll side
      If not last eve, to-night."

   -- "You get small rest -- that read I quite;
      And so do I, maybe;
   Though there's a rest hid safe from sight
      Elsewhere awaiting me!"

   A mad star crossed the sky to the sea,
      Wasting in sparks as it streamed,
   And when I looked to where stood she
      She had changed, much changed, it seemed:

   The sparks of the star in her pupils gleamed,
      She was vague as a vapour now,
   And ere of its meaning I had dreamed
      She'd vanished -- I knew not how.

   I stood on, long; each cliff-top bough,
      Like a cynic nodding there,
   Moved up and down, though no man's brow
      But mine met the wayward air.

   Still stood I, wholly unaware
      Of what had come to pass,
   Or had brought the secret of my new Fair
      To my old Love, alas!

   I went down then by crag and grass
      To the boat wherein I had come.
   Said the man with the oars: "This news of the lass
      Of Edgcumbe, is sharp for some!

   "Yes: found this daybreak, stiff and numb
      On the shore here, whither she'd sped
   To meet her lover last night in the glum,
      And he came not, 'tis said.

   "And she leapt down, heart-hit.  Pity she's dead:
      So much for the faithful-bent!" . . .
   I looked, and again a star overhead
      Shot through the firmament.




SHE WHO SAW NOT


      "DID you see something within the house
   That made me call you before the red sunsetting?
   Something that all this common scene endows
   With a richened impress there can be no forgetting?"

      " -- I have found nothing to see therein,
   O Sage, that should have made you urge me to enter,
   Nothing to fire the soul, or the sense to win:
   I rate you as a rare misrepresenter!"

      " -- Go anew, Lady, -- in by the right . . .
   Well: why does your face not shine like the face of Moses?"
   " -- I found no moving thing there save the light
   And shadow flung on the wall by the outside roses."

      " -- Go yet once more, pray.  Look on a seat."
   " -- I go . . . O Sage, it's only a man that sits there
   With eyes on the sun.  Mute, -- average head to feet."
   " -- No more?" -- "No more.  Just one the place befits there,

      "As the rays reach in through the open door,
   And he looks at his hand, and the sun glows through his fingers,
   While he's thinking thoughts whose tenour is no more
   To me than the swaying rose-tree shade that lingers."

      No more.  And years drew on and on
   Till no sun came, dank fogs the house enfolding;
   And she saw inside, when the form in the flesh had gone,
   As a vision what she had missed when the real beholding.




THE OLD WORKMAN


   "WHY are you so bent down before your time,
   Old mason?  Many have not left their prime
   So far behind at your age, and can still
      Stand full upright at will."

   He pointed to the mansion-front hard by,
   And to the stones of the quoin against the sky;
   "Those upper blocks," he said, "that there you see,
      It was that ruined me."

   There stood in the air up to the parapet
   Crowning the corner height, the stones as set
   By him -- ashlar whereon the gales might drum
      For centuries to come.

   "I carried them up," he said, "by a ladder there;
   The last was as big a load as I could bear;
   But on I heaved; and something in my back
      Moved, as 'twere with a crack.

   "So I got crookt.  I never lost that sprain;
   And those who live there, walled from wind and rain
   By freestone that I lifted, do not know
      That my life's ache came so.

   "They don't know me, or even know my name,
   But good I think it, somehow, all the same
   To have kept 'em safe from harm, and right and tight,
      Though it has broke me quite.

   "Yes; that I fixed it firm up there I am proud,
   Facing the hail and snow and sun and cloud,
   And to stand storms for ages, beating round
      When I lie underground."




THE SAILOR'S MOTHER


      "O WHENCE do you come,
   Figure in the night-fog that chills me numb?"

   "I come to you across from my house up there,
   And I don't mind the brine-mist clinging to me
      That blows from the quay,
   For I heard him in my chamber, and thought you unaware."

      "But what did you hear,
   That brought you blindly knocking in this middle-watch so drear?"

   "My sailor son's voice as 'twere calling at your door,
   And I don't mind my bare feet clammy on the stones,
      And the blight to my bones,
   For he only knows of -- this -- house I lived in before."

      "Nobody's nigh,
   Woman like a skeleton, with socket-sunk eye."

   "Ah -- nobody's nigh!  And my life is drearisome,
   And this is the old home we loved in many a day
      Before he went away;
   And the salt fog mops me.  And nobody's come!"

From "To Please his Wife."




OUTSIDE THE CASEMENT
(A REMINISCENCE OF THE WAR)


      WE sat in the room
      And praised her whom
   We saw in the portico-shade outside:
      She could not hear
      What was said of her,
   But smiled, for its purport we did not hide.

      Then in was brought
      That message, fraught
   With evil fortune for her out there,
      Whom we loved that day
      More than any could say,
   And would fain have fenced from a waft of care.

      And the question pressed
      Like lead on each breast,
   Should we cloak the tidings, or call her and tell?
      It was too intense
      A choice for our sense,
   As we pondered and watched her we loved so well.

      Yea, spirit failed us
      At what assailed us;
   How long, while seeing what soon must come,
      Should we counterfeit
      No knowledge of it,
   And stay the stroke that would blanch and numb?

      And thus, before
      For evermore
   Joy left her, we practised to beguile
      Her innocence when
      She now and again
   Looked in, and smiled us another smile.




THE PASSER-BY
(L. H. RECALLS HER ROMANCE)


   He used to pass, well-trimmed and brushed,
      My window every day,
   And when I smiled on him he blushed,
   That youth, quite as a girl might; aye,
      In the shyest way.

   Thus often did he pass hereby,
      That youth of bounding gait,
   Until the one who blushed was I,
   And he became, as here I sate,
      My joy, my fate.

   And now he passes by no more,
      That youth I loved too true!
   I grieve should he, as here of yore,
   Pass elsewhere, seated in his view,
      Some maiden new!

   If such should be, alas for her!
      He'll make her feel him dear,
   Become her daily comforter,
   Then tire him of her beauteous gear,
      And disappear!




"I WAS THE MIDMOST"


   I WAS the midmost of my world
      When first I frisked me free,
   For though within its circuit gleamed
      But a small company,
   And I was immature, they seemed
      To bend their looks on me.

   She was the midmost of my world
      When I went further forth,
   And hence it was that, whether I turned
      To south, east, west, or north,
   Beams of an all-day Polestar burned
      From that new axe of earth.

   Where now is midmost in my world?
      I trace it not at all:
   No midmost shows it here, or there,
      When wistful voices call
   "We are fain!  We are fain!" from everywhere
      On Earth's bewildering ball!




A SOUND IN THE NIGHT


   "WHAT do I catch upon the night-wind, husband? -- 
   What is it sounds in this house so eerily?
   It seems to be a woman's voice: each little while I hear it,
      And it much troubles me!"

   "'Tis but the eaves dripping down upon the plinth-slopes:
   Letting fancies worry thee! -- sure 'tis a foolish thing,
   When we were on'y coupled half-an-hour before the noontide,
      And now it's but evening."

   "Yet seems it still a woman's voice outside the castle, husband,
   And 'tis cold to-night, and rain beats, and this is a lonely place.
   Didst thou fathom much of womankind in travel or adventure
      Ere ever thou sawest my face?"

   "It may be a tree, bride, that rubs his arms acrosswise,
   If it is not the eaves-drip upon the lower slopes,
   Or the river at the bend, where it whirls about the hatches
      Like a creature that sighs and mopes."

   "Yet it still seems to me like the crying of a woman,
   And it saddens me much that so piteous a sound
   On this my bridal night when I would get agone from sorrow
      Should so ghost-like wander round!"

   "To satisfy thee, Love, I will strike the flint-and-steel, then,
   And set the rush-candle up, and undo the door,
   And take the new horn-lantern that we bought upon our journey,
      And throw the light over the moor."

   He struck a light, and breeched and booted in the further chamber,
   And lit the new horn-lantern and went from her sight,
   And vanished down the turret; and she heard him pass the postern,
      And go out into the night.

   She listened as she lay, till she heard his step returning,
   And his voice as he unclothed him: "'Twas nothing, as I said,
   But the nor'-west wind a-blowing from the moor ath'art the river,
      And the tree that taps the gurgoyle-head."

   "Nay, husband, you perplex me; for if the noise I heard here,
   Awaking me from sleep so, were but as you avow,
   The rain-fall, and the wind, and the tree-bough, and the river,
      Why is it silent now?

   "And why is thy hand and thy clasping arm so shaking,
   And thy sleeve and tags of hair so muddy and so wet,
   And why feel I thy heart a-thumping every time thou kissest me,
      And thy breath as if hard to get?"

   He lay there in silence for a while, still quickly breathing,
   Then started up and walked about the room resentfully:
   "O woman, witch, whom I, in sooth, against my will have wedded,
      Why castedst thou thy spells on me?

   "There was one I loved once: the cry you heard was her cry:
   She came to me to-night, and her plight was passing sore,
   As no woman . . . Yea, and it was e'en the cry you heard, wife,
      But she will cry no more!

   "And now I can't abide thee: this place, it hath a curse on't,
   This farmstead once a castle: I'll get me straight away!"
   He dressed this time in darkness, unspeaking, as she listened,
      And went ere the dawn turned day.

   They found a woman's body at a spot called Rocky Shallow,
   Where the Froom stream curves amid the moorland, washed aground,
   And they searched about for him, the yeoman, who had darkly known her,
      But he could not be found.

   And the bride left for good-and-all the farmstead once a castle,
   And in a county far away lives, mourns, and sleeps alone,
   And thinks in windy weather that she hears a woman crying,
      And sometimes an infant's moan.




ON A DISCOVERED CURL OF HAIR


   WHEN your soft welcomings were said,
   This curl was waving on your head,
   And when we walked where breakers dinned
   It sported in the sun and wind,
   And when I had won your words of grace
   It brushed and clung about my face.
   Then, to abate the misery
   Of absentness, you gave it me.

   Where are its fellows now?  Ah, they
   For brightest brown have donned a gray,
   And gone into a caverned ark,
   Ever unopened, always dark!

   Yet this one curl, untouched of time,
   Beams with live brown as in its prime,
   So that it seems I even could now
   Restore it to the living brow
   By bearing down the western road
   Till I had reached your old abode.



AN OLD LIKENESS
(RECALLING R. T.)


   WHO would have thought
   That, not having missed her
   Talks, tears, laughter
   In absence, or sought
   To recall for so long
   Her gamut of song;
   Or ever to waft her
   Signal of aught
   That she, fancy-fanned,
   Would well understand,
   I should have kissed her
   Picture when scanned
   Yawning years after!

   Yet, seeing her poor
   Dim-outlined form
   Chancewise at night-time,
   Some old allure
   Came on me, warm,
   Fresh, pleadful, pure,
   As in that bright time
   At a far season
   Of love and unreason,
   And took me by storm
   Here in this blight-time!

   And thus it arose
   That, yawning years after
   Our early flows
   Of wit and laughter,
   And framing of rhymes
   At idle times,
   At sight of her painting,
   Though she lies cold
   In churchyard mould,
   I took its feinting
   As real, and kissed it,
   As if I had wist it
   Herself of old.




HER APOTHEOSIS
"Secretum meum mihi"
(FADED WOMAN'S SONG)


   THERE was a spell of leisure,
      No record vouches when;
   With honours, praises, pleasure
      To womankind from men.

   But no such lures bewitched me,
      No hand was stretched to raise,
   No gracious gifts enriched me,
      No voices sang my praise.

   Yet an iris at that season
      Amid the accustomed slight
   From denseness, dull unreason,
      Ringed me with living light.




"SACRED TO THE MEMORY"
(MARY H.)


   THAT "Sacred to the Memory"
   Is clearly carven there I own,
   And all may think that on the stone
   The words have been inscribed by me
   In bare conventionality.

   They know not and will never know
   That my full script is not confined
   To that stone space, but stands deep lined
   Upon the landscape high and low
   Wherein she made such worthy show.




TO A WELL-NAMED DWELLING


   GLAD old house of lichened stonework,
   What I owed you in my lone work,
      Noon and night!
   Whensoever faint or ailing,
   Letting go my grasp and failing,
      You lent light.

   How by that fair title came you?
   Did some forward eye so name you
      Knowing that one,
   Sauntering down his century blindly,
   Would remark your sound, so kindly,
      And be won?

   Smile in sunlight, sleep in moonlight,
   Bask in April, May, and June-light,
      Zephyr-fanned;
   Let your chambers show no sorrow,
   Blanching day, or stuporing morrow,
      While they stand.




THE WHIPPER-IN


   MY father was the whipper-in, -- 
      Is still -- if I'm not misled?
   And now I see, where the hedge is thin,
      A little spot of red;
      Surely it is my father
      Going to the kennel-shed!

   "I cursed and fought my father -- aye,
      And sailed to a foreign land;
   And feeling sorry, I'm back, to stay,
      Please God, as his helping hand.
      Surely it is my father
      Near where the kennels stand?"

   " -- True.  Whipper-in he used to be
      For twenty years or more;
   And you did go away to sea
      As youths have done before.
      Yes, oddly enough that red there
      Is the very coat he wore.

   "But he -- he's dead; was thrown somehow,
      And gave his back a crick,
   And though that is his coat, 'tis now
      The scarecrow of a rick;
      You'll see when you get nearer -- 
      'Tis spread out on a stick.

   "You see, when all had settled down
      Your mother's things were sold,
   And she went back to her own town,
      And the coat, ate out with mould,
      Is now used by the farmer
      For scaring, as 'tis old."




A MILITARY APPOINTMENT
(SCHERZANDO)


   "SO back you have come from the town, Nan, dear!
   And have you seen him there, or near -- 
      That soldier of mine -- 
   Who long since promised to meet me here?"

   " -- O yes, Nell: from the town I come,
   And have seen your lover on sick-leave home -- 
      That soldier of yours -- 
   Who swore to meet you, or Strike-him-dumb;

   "But has kept himself of late away;
   Yet, -- in short, he's coming, I heard him say -- 
      That lover of yours -- 
   To this very spot on this very day."

   " -- Then I'll wait, I'll wait, through wet or dry!
   I'll give him a goblet brimming high -- 
      This lover of mine -- 
   And not of complaint one word or sigh!"

   " -- Nell, him I have chanced so much to see,
   That -- he has grown the lover of me! -- 
      That lover of yours -- 
   And it's here our meeting is planned to be."




THE MILESTONE BY THE RABBIT-BURROW
(ON YELL'HAM HILL)


   IN my loamy nook
   As I dig my hole
   I observe men look
   At a stone, and sigh
   As they pass it by
   To some far goal.

   Something it says
   To their glancing eyes
   That must distress
   The frail and lame,
   And the strong of frame
   Gladden or surprise.

   Do signs on its face
   Declare how far
   Feet have to trace
   Before they gain
   Some blest champaign
   Where no gins are?




THE LAMENT OF THE LOOKING-GLASS


   WORDS from the mirror softly pass
      To the curtains with a sigh:
   "Why should I trouble again to glass
      These smileless things hard by,
   Since she I pleasured once, alas,
      Is now no longer nigh!"

   "I've imaged shadows of coursing cloud,
      And of the plying limb
   On the pensive pine when the air is loud
      With its aerial hymn;
   But never do they make me proud
      To catch them within my rim!

   "I flash back phantoms of the night
      That sometimes flit by me,
   I echo roses red and white -- 
      The loveliest blooms that be -- 
   But now I never hold to sight
      So sweet a flower as she."




CROSS-CURRENTS


   THEY parted -- a pallid, trembling I pair,
      And rushing down the lane
   He left her lonely near me there;
      -- I asked her of their pain.

   "It is for ever," at length she said,
      "His friends have schemed it so,
   That the long-purposed day to wed
      Never shall we two know."

   "In such a cruel case," said I,
      "Love will contrive a course?"
   " -- Well, no . . . A thing may underlie,
      Which robs that of its force;

   "A thing I could not tell him of,
      Though all the year I have tried;
   This: never could I have given him love,
      Even had I been his bride.

   "So, when his kinsfolk stop the way
      Point-blank, there could not be
   A happening in the world to-day
      More opportune for me!

   "Yet hear -- no doubt to your surprise -- 
      I am sorry, for his sake,
   That I have escaped the sacrifice
      I was prepared to make!"




THE OLD NEIGHBOUR AND THE NEW


   'TWAS to greet the new rector I called I here,
      But in the arm-chair I see
   My old friend, for long years installed here,
      Who palely nods to me.

   The new man explains what he's planning
      In a smart and cheerful tone,
   And I listen, the while that I'm scanning
      The figure behind his own.

   The newcomer urges things on me;
      I return a vague smile thereto,
   The olden face gazing upon me
      Just as it used to do!

   And on leaving I scarcely remember
      Which neighbour to-day I have seen,
   The one carried out in September,
      Or him who but entered yestreen.




THE CHOSEN


                          "                         

   "A WOMAN for whom great gods might strive!"
      I said, and kissed her there:
   And then I thought of the other five,
      And of how charms outwear.

   I thought of the first with her eating eyes,
   And I thought of the second with hers, green-gray,
   And I thought of the third, experienced, wise,
   And I thought of the fourth who sang all day.

   And I thought of the fifth, whom I'd called a jade,
      And I thought of them all, tear-fraught;
   And that each had shown her a passable maid,
      Yet not of the favour sought.

   So I traced these words on the bark of a beech,
   Just at the falling of the mast:
   "After scanning five; yes, each and each,
   I've found the woman desired -- at last!"

   " -- I feel a strange benumbing spell,
      As one ill-wished!" said she.
   And soon it seemed that something fell
      Was starving her love for me.

   "I feel some curse.  O, -- five -- were there?"
   And wanly she swerved, and went away.
   I followed sick: night numbed the air,
   And dark the mournful moorland lay.

   I cried: "O darling, turn your head!"
      But never her face I viewed;
   "O turn, O turn!" again I said,
      And miserably pursued.

   At length I came to a Christ-cross stone
   Which she had passed without discern;
   And I knelt upon the leaves there strown,
   And prayed aloud that she might turn.

   I rose, and looked; and turn she did;
      I cried, "My heart revives!"
   "Look more," she said.  I looked as bid;
      Her face was all the five's.

   All the five women, clear come back,
   I saw in her -- with her made one,
   The while she drooped upon the track,
   And her frail term seemed well-nigh run.

   She'd half forgot me in her change;
      "Who are you?  Won't you say
   Who you may be, you man so strange,
      Following since yesterday?"

   I took the composite form she was,
   And carried her to an arbour small,
   Not passion-moved, but even because
   In one I could atone to all.

   And there she lies, and there I tend,
      Till my life's threads unwind,
   A various womanhood in blend -- 
      Not one, but all combined.




THE INSCRIPTION
(A TALE)


   SIR JOHN was entombed, and the crypt was closed, and she,
   Like a soul that could meet no more the sight of the sun,
   Inclined her in weepings and prayings continually,
      As his widowed one.

   And to pleasure her in her sorrow, and fix his name
   As a memory Time's fierce frost should never kill,
   She caused to be richly chased a brass to his fame,
      Which should link them still;

   For she bonded her name with his own on the brazen page,
   As if dead and interred there with him, and cold, and numb,
   (Omitting the day of her dying and year of her age
      Till her end should come;)

   And implored good people to pray "Of their Charytie
   For these twaine Soules," -- yea, she who did last remain
   Forgoing Heaven's bliss if ever with spouse should she
      Again have lain.

   Even there, as it first was set, you may see it now,
   Writ in quaint Church text, with the date of her death left bare,
   In the aged Estminster aisle, where the folk yet bow
      Themselves in prayer.

   Thereafter some years slid, till there came a day
   When it slowly began to be marked of the standers-by
   That she would regard the brass, and would bend away
      With a drooping sigh.

   Now the lady was fair as any the eye might scan
   Through a summer day of roving -- a type at whose lip
   Despite her maturing seasons, no meet man
      Would be loth to sip.

   And her heart was stirred with a lightning love to its pith
   For a newcomer who, while less in years, was one
   Full eager and able to make her his own forthwith,
      Restrained of none.

   But she answered Nay, death-white; and still as he urged
   She adversely spake, overmuch as she loved the while,
   Till he pressed for why, and she led with the face of one scourged
      To the neighbouring aisle,

   And showed him the words, ever gleaming upon her pew,
   Memorizing her there as the knight's eternal wife,
   Or falsing such, debarred inheritance due
      Of celestial life.

   He blenched, and reproached her that one yet undeceased
   Should bury her future -- that future which none can spell;
   And she wept, and purposed anon to inquire of the priest
      If the price were hell

   Of her wedding in face of the record.  Her lover agreed,
   And they parted before the brass with a shudderful kiss,
   For it seemed to flash out on their impulse of passionate need,
      "Mock ye not this!"

   Well, the priest, whom more perceptions moved than one,
   Said she erred at the first to have written as if she were dead
   Her name and adjuration; but since it was done
      Nought could be said

   Save that she must abide by the pledge, for the peace of her soul,
   And so, by her life, maintain the apostrophe good,
   If she wished anon to reach the coveted goal
      Of beatitude.

   To erase from the consecrate text her prayer as there prayed
   Would aver that, since earth's joys most drew her, past doubt,
   Friends' prayers for her joy above by Jesu's aid
      Could be done without.

   Moreover she thought of the laughter, the shrug, the jibe
   That would rise at her back in the nave when she should pass
   As another's avowed by the words she had chosen to inscribe
      On the changeless brass.

   And so for months she replied to her Love: "No, no";
   While sorrow was gnawing her beauties ever and more,
   Till he, long-suffering and weary, grew to show
      Less warmth than before.

   And, after an absence, wrote words absolute:
   That he gave her till Midsummer morn to make her mind clear;
   And that if, by then, she had not said Yea to his suit,
      He should wed elsewhere.

   Thence on, at unwonted times through the lengthening days
   She was seen in the church -- at dawn, or when the sun dipt
   And the moon rose, standing with hands joined, blank of gaze,
      Before the script.

   She thinned as he came not; shrank like a creature that cowers
   As summer drew nearer; but still had not promised to wed,
   When, just at the zenith of June, in the still night hours,
      She was missed from her bed.

   "The church!" they whispered with qualms; "where often she sits."
   They found her: facing the brass there, else seeing none,
   But feeling the words with her finger, gibbering in fits;
      And she knew them not one.

   And so she remained, in her handmaids' charge; late, soon,
   Tracing words in the air with her finger, as seen that night -- 
   Those incised on the brass -- till at length unwatched one noon,
      She vanished from sight.

   And, as talebearers tell, thence on to her last-taken breath
   Was unseen, save as wraith that in front of the brass made moan;
   So that ever the way of her life and the time of her death
      Remained unknown.

   And hence, as indited above, you may read even now
   The quaint church-text, with the date of her death left bare,
   In the aged Estminster aisle, where folk yet bow
      Themselves in prayer.



THE MARBLE-STREETED TOWN


   I REACH the marble-streeted town,
      Whose "Sound" outbreathes its air
         Of sharp sea-salts;
   I see the movement up and down
         As when she was there.
   Ships of all countries come and go,
      The bandsmen boom in the sun
         A throbbing waltz;
   The schoolgirls laugh along the Hoe
         As when she was one.

   I move away as the music rolls:
      The place seems not to mind
         That she -- of old
   The brightest of its native souls -- 
         Left it behind!
   Over this green aforedays she
      On light treads went and came,
         Yea, times untold;
   Yet none here knows her history -- 
         Has heard her name.




A WOMAN DRIVING


   HOW she held up the horses' heads,
      Firm-lipped, with steady rein,
   Down that grim steep the coastguard treads,
      Till all was safe again!

   With form erect and keen contour
      She passed against the sea,
   And, dipping into the chine's obscure,
      Was seen no more by me.

   To others she appeared anew
      At times of dusky light,
   But always, so they told, withdrew
      From close and curious sight.

   Some said her silent wheels would roll
      Rutless on softest loam,
   And even that her steeds' footfall
      Sank not upon the foam.

   Where drives she now?  It may be where
      No mortal horses are,
   But in a chariot of the air
      Towards some radiant star.




A WOMAN'S TRUST


   IF he should live a thousand years
      He'd find it not again
      That scorn of him by men
   Could less disturb a woman's trust
   In him as a steadfast star which must
   Rise scathless from the nether spheres:
   If he should live a thousand years
      He'd find it not again.

   She waited like a little child,
      Unchilled by damps of doubt,
      While from her eyes looked out
   A confidence sublime as Spring's
   When stressed by Winter's loiterings.
   Thus, howsoever the wicked wiled,
   She waited like a little child
      Unchilled by damps of doubt.

   Through cruel years and crueller
      Thus she believed in him
      And his aurore, so dim;
   That, after fenweeds, flowers would blow;
   And above all things did she show
   Her faith in his good faith with her;
   Through cruel years and crueller
      Thus she believed in him!




BEST TIMES


   WE went a day's excursion to the stream,
   Basked by the bank, and bent to the ripple-gleam,
         And I did not know
         That life would show,
   However it might flower, no finer glow.

   I walked in the Sunday sunshine by the road
   That wound towards the wicket of your abode,
         And I did not think
         That life would shrink
   To nothing ere it shed a rosier pink.

   Unlooked for I arrived on a rainy night,
   And you hailed me at the door by the swaying light,
         And I full forgot
         That life might not
   Again be touching that ecstatic height.

   And that calm eve when you walked up the stair,
   After a gaiety prolonged and rare,
         No thought soever
         That you might never
   Walk down again, struck me as I stood there.

Rewritten from an old draft.




THE CASUAL ACQUAINTANCE


   WHILE he was here in breath and bone,
      To speak to and to see,
   Would I had known -- more clearly known -- 
      What that man did for me

   When the wind scraped a minor lay,
      And the spent west from white
   To gray turned tiredly, and from gray
      To broadest bands of night!

   But I saw not, and he saw not
      What shining life-tides flowed
   To me-ward from his casual jot
      Of service on that road.

   He would have said: "'Twas nothing new;
      We all do what we can;
   'Twas only what one man would do
      For any other man."

   Now that I gauge his goodliness
      He's slipped from human eyes;
   And when he passed there's none can guess,
      Or point out where he lies.




INTRA SEPULCHRUM


      WHAT curious things we said,
      What curious things we did
   Up there in the world we walked till dead
      Our kith and kin amid!

      How we played at love,
      And its wildness, weakness, woe;
   Yes, played thereat far more than enough
      As it turned out, I trow!

      Played at believing in gods
      And observing the ordinances,
   I for your sake in impossible codes
      Right ready to acquiesce.

      Thinking our lives unique,
      Quite quainter than usual kinds,
   We held that we could not abide a week
      The tether of typic minds.

      -- Yet people who day by day
      Pass by and look at us
   From over the wall in a casual way
      Are of this unconscious.

      And feel, if anything,
      That none can be buried here
   Removed from commonest fashioning,
      Or lending note to a bier:

      No twain who in heart-heaves proved
      Themselves at all adept,
   Who more than many laughed and loved,
      Who more than many wept,

      Or were as sprites or elves
      Into blind matter hurled,
   Or ever could have been to themselves
      The centre of the world.




THE WHITEWASHED WALL


   WHY does she turn in that shy soft way
      Whenever she stirs the fire,
   And kiss to the chimney-corner wall,
      As if entranced to admire
   Its whitewashed bareness more than the sight
      Of a rose in richest green?
   I have known her long, but this raptured rite
      I never before have seen.

   -- Well, once when her son cast his shadow there,
      A friend took a pencil and drew him
   Upon that flame-lit wall.  And the lines
      Had a lifelike semblance to him.
   And there long stayed his familiar look;
      But one day, ere she knew,
   The whitener came to cleanse the nook,
      And covered the face from view.

   "Yes," he said: "My brush goes on with a rush,
      And the draught is buried under;
   When you have to whiten old cots and brighten,
      What else can you do, I wonder?"
   But she knows he's there.  And when she yearns
      For him, deep in the labouring night,
   She sees him as close at hand, and turns
      To him under his sheet of white.




JUST THE SAME


   I SAT.  It all was past;
   Hope never would hail again;
   Fair days had ceased at a blast,
   The world was a darkened den.

   The beauty and dream were gone,
   And the halo in which I had hied
   So gaily gallantly on
   Had suffered blot and died!

   I went forth, heedless whither,
   In a cloud too black for name:
   -- People frisked hither and thither;
   The world was just the same.




THE LAST TIME


   THE kiss had been given and taken,
      And gathered to many past:
   It never could reawaken;
      But you heard none say: "It's the last!"

   The clock showed the hour and the minute,
      But you did not turn and look:
   You read no finis in it,
      As at closing of a book.

   But you read it all too rightly
      When, at a time anon,
   A figure lay stretched out whitely,
      And you stood looking thereon.




THE SEVEN TIMES


   THE dark was thick.  A boy he seemed at that time
      Who trotted by me with uncertain air;
   "I'll tell my tale," he murmured, "for I fancy
      A friend goes there? . . . "

   Then thus he told.  "I reached -- 'twas for the first time -- 
      A dwelling.  Life was clogged in me with care;
   I thought not I should meet an eyesome maiden,
      But found one there.

   "I entered on the precincts for the second time -- 
      'Twas an adventure fit and fresh and fair -- 
   I slackened in my footsteps at the porchway,
      And found her there.

   "I rose and travelled thither for the third time,
      The hope-hues growing gayer and yet gayer
   As I hastened round the boscage of the outskirts,
      And found her there.

   "I journeyed to the place again the fourth time
      (The best and rarest visit of the rare,
   As it seemed to me, engrossed about these goings),
      And found her there.

   "When I bent me to my pilgrimage the fifth time
      (Soft-thinking as I journeyed I would dare
   A certain word at token of good auspice),
      I found her there.

   "That landscape did I traverse for the sixth time,
      And dreamed on what we purposed to prepare;
   I reached a tryst before my journey's end came,
      And found her there.

   "I went again -- long after -- aye, the seventh time;
      The look of things was sinister and bare
   As I caught no customed signal, heard no voice call,
      Nor found her there.

   "And now I gad the globe -- day, night, and any time,
      To light upon her hiding unaware,
   And, maybe, I shall nigh me to some nymph-niche,
      And find her there!"

   "But how," said I, "has your so little lifetime
      Given roomage for such loving, loss, despair?
   A boy so young!"  Forthwith I turned my lantern
      Upon him there.

   His head was white.  His small form, fine aforetime,
      Was shrunken with old age and battering wear,
   An eighty-years long plodder saw I pacing
      Beside me there.




THE SUN'S LAST LOOK ON THE COUNTRY GIRL
(M. H.)


   THE sun threw down a radiant spot
      On the face in the winding-sheet -- 
   The face it had lit when a babe's in its cot;
   And the sun knew not, and the face knew not
      That soon they would no more meet.

   Now that the grave has shut its door,
      And lets not in one ray,
   Do they wonder that they meet no more -- 
   That face and its beaming visitor -- 
      That met so many a day?





IN A LONDON FLAT


                 

   "YOU look like a widower," she said
   Through the folding-doors with a laugh from the bed,
   As he sat by the fire in the outer room,
   Reading late on a night of gloom,
   And a cab-hack's wheeze, and the clap of its feet
   In its breathless pace on the smooth wet street,
   Were all that came to them now and then . . .
   "You really do!" she quizzed again.

                               

   And the Spirits behind the curtains heard,
   And also laughed, amused at her word,
   And at her light-hearted view of him.
   "Let's get him made so -- just for a whim!"
   Said the Phantom Ironic.  "'Twould serve her right
   If we coaxed the Will to do it some night."
   "O pray not!" pleaded the younger one,
   The Sprite of the Pities.  "She said it in fun!"

                              

   But so it befell, whatever the cause,
   That what she had called him he next year was;
   And on such a night, when she lay elsewhere,
   He, watched by those Phantoms, again sat there,
   And gazed, as if gazing on far faint shores,
   At the empty bed through the folding-doors
   As he remembered her words; and wept
   That she had forgotten them where she slept.




DRAWING DETAILS IN AN OLD CHURCH


   I HEAR the bell-rope sawing,
   And the oil-less axle grind,
   As I sit alone here drawing
   What some Gothic brain designed;
   And I catch the toll that follows
      From the lagging bell,
   Ere it spreads to hills and hollows
   Where the parish people dwell.

   I ask not whom it tolls for,
   Incurious who he be;
   So, some morrow, when those knolls for
   One unguessed, sound out for me,
   A stranger, loitering under
      In nave or choir,
   May think, too, "Whose, I wonder?"
   But care not to inquire.




RAKE-HELL MUSES


   YES; since she knows not need,
      Nor walks in blindness,
   I may without unkindness
      A true thing tell:

   Which would be truth, indeed,
      Though worse in speaking,
   Were her poor footsteps seeking
      A pauper's cell.

   I judge, then, better far
      She now have sorrow,
   Than gladness that to-morrow
      Might know its knell. -- 

   It may be men there are
      Could make of union
   A lifelong sweet communion -- 
      A passioned spell;

   But -- I -- , to save her name
      And bring salvation
   By altar-affirmation
      And bridal bell;

   I, by whose rash unshame
      These tears come to her: -- 
   My faith would more undo her
      Than my farewell!

   Chained to me, year by year
      My moody madness
   Would wither her old gladness
      Like famine fell.

   She'll take the ill that's near,
      And bear the blaming.
   'Twill pass.  Full soon her shaming
      They'll cease to yell.

   Our unborn, first her moan,
      Will grow her guerdon,
   Until from blot and burden
      A joyance swell;

   In that therein she'll own
      My good part wholly,
   My evil staining solely
      My own vile vell.

   Of the disgrace, may be
      "He shunned to share it,
   Being false," they'll say.  I'll bear it;
      Time will dispel

   The calumny, and prove
      This much about me,
   That she lives best without me
      Who would live well.

   That, this once, not self-love
      But good intention
   Pleads that against convention
      We two rebel.

   For, is one moonlight dance,
      One midnight passion,
   A rock whereon to fashion
      Life's citadel?

   Prove they their power to prance
      Life's miles together
   From upper slope to nether
      Who trip an ell?

   -- Years hence, or now apace,
      May tongues be calling
   News of my further falling
      Sinward pell-mell:

   Then this great good will grace
      Our lives' division,
   She's saved from more misprision
      Though I plumb hell.




THE COLOUR

   "WHAT shall I bring you?
   Please will white do
   Best for your wearing
      The long day through?"
   " -- White is for weddings,
   Weddings, weddings,
   White is for weddings,
      And that won't do."

   "What shall I bring you?
   Please will red do
   Best for your wearing
      The long day through?"
   " -- Red is for soldiers,
   Soldiers, soldiers,
   Red is for soldiers,
      And that won't do."

   "What shall I bring you?
   Please will blue do
   Best for your wearing
      The long day through?"
   " -- Blue is for sailors,
   Sailors, sailors,
   Blue is for sailors,
      And that won't do.

   "What shall I bring you?
   Please will green do
   Best for your wearing
      The long day through?"
   " -- Green is for mayings,
   Mayings, mayings,
   Green is for mayings,
      And that won't do."

   "What shall I bring you
   Then?  Will black do
   Best for your wearing
      The long day through?"
   " -- Black is for mourning,
   Mourning, mourning,
   Black is for mourning,
      And black will do."




MURMURS IN THE GLOOM
(NOCTURNE)


   I WAYFARED at the nadir of the sun
   Where populations meet, though seen of none;
      And millions seemed to sigh around
      As though their haunts were nigh around,
      And unknown throngs to cry around
         Of things late done.

   "O Seers, who well might high ensample show"
   (Came throbbing past in plainsong small and slow),
      "Leaders who lead us aimlessly,
      Teachers who train us shamelessly,
      Why let ye smoulder flamelessly
         The truths ye trow?

   "Ye scribes, that urge the old medicament,
   Whose fusty vials have long dried impotent,
      Why prop ye meretricious things,
      Denounce the sane as vicious things,
      And call outworn factitious things
         Expedient?

   "O Dynasties that sway and shake us so,
   Why rank your magnanimities so low
      That grace can smooth no waters yet,
      But breathing threats and slaughters yet
      Ye grieve Earth's sons and daughters yet
         As long ago?

   "Live there no heedful ones of searching sight,
   Whose accents might be oracles that smite
      To hinder those who frowardly
      Conduct us, and untowardly;
      To lead the nations vawardly
         From gloom to light?"




EPITAPH


   I NEVER cared for Life: Life cared for me,
   And hence I owed it some fidelity.
   It now says, "Cease; at length thou hast learnt to grind
   Sufficient toll for an unwilling mind,
   And I dismiss thee -- not without regard
   That thou didst ask no ill-advised reward,
   Nor sought in me much more than thou couldst find."




AN ANCIENT TO ANCIENTS


   WHERE once we danced, where once sang,
         Gentlemen,
   The floors are sunken, cobwebs hang,
   And cracks creep; worms have fed upon
   The doors.  Yea, sprightlier times were then
   Than now, with harps and tabrets gone,
         Gentlemen!

   Where once we rowed, where once we sailed,
         Gentlemen,
   And damsels took the tiller, veiled
   Against too strong a stare (God wot
   Their fancy, then or anywhen!)
   Upon that shore we are clean forgot,
         Gentlemen!

   We have lost somewhat, afar and near,
         Gentlemen,
   The thinning of our ranks each year
   Affords a hint we are nigh undone,
   That we shall not be ever again
   The marked of many, loved of one,
         Gentlemen.

   In dance the polka hit our wish,
         Gentlemen,
   The paced quadrille, the spry schottische,
   "Sir Roger." -- And in opera spheres
   The "Girl" (the famed "Bohemian"),
   And "Trovatore," held the ears,
         Gentlemen.

   This season's paintings do not please,
         Gentlemen,
   Like Etty, Mulready, Maclise;
   Throbbing romance has waned and wanned;
   No wizard wields the witching pen
   Of Bulwer, Scott, Dumas, and Sand,
         Gentlemen.

   The bower we shrined to Tennyson,
         Gentlemen,
   Is roof-wrecked; damps there drip upon
   Sagged seats, the creeper-nails are rust,
   The spider is sole denizen;
   Even she who read those rhymes is dust,
         Gentlemen!

   We who met sunrise sanguine-souled,
         Gentlemen,
   Are wearing weary.  We are old;
   These younger press; we feel our rout
   Is imminent to Andes' den, -- 
   That evening's shades are stretching out,
         Gentlemen!

   And yet, though ours be failing frames,
         Gentlemen,
   So were some others' history names,
   Who trode their track light-limbed and fast
   As these youth, and not alien
   From enterprise, to their long last,
         Gentlemen.

   Sophocles, Plato, Socrates,
         Gentlemen,
   Pythagoras, Thucydides,
   Herodotus, and Homer, -- yea,
   Clement, Augustin, Origen,
   Burnt brightlier towards their setting-day,
         Gentlemen.

   And ye, red-lipped and smooth-browed; list,
         Gentlemen;
   Much is there waits you we have missed;
   Much lore we leave you worth the knowing,
   Much, much has lain outside our ken:
   Nay, rush not: time serves: we are going,
         Gentlemen.




AFTER READING PSALMS
XXXIX., XL., ETC.


   SIMPLE was I and was young;
      Kept no gallant tryst, I;
   Even from good words held my tongue,
      -- Quoniam Tu fecisti -- !

   Through my youth I stirred me not,
      High adventure missed I,
   Left the shining shrines unsought;
      Yet ---- me deduxisti -- !

   At my start by Helicon
      Love-lore little wist I,
   Worldly less; but footed on;
      Why?  -- Me suscepisti -- !

   When I failed at fervid rhymes,
      "Shall," I said, "persist I?"
   " -- Dies -- " (I would add at times)
      " -- Meos posuisti -- !"

   So I have fared through many suns;
      Sadly little grist I
   Bring my mill, or any one's,
      -- Domine -- , -- Tu scisti -- !

   And at dead of night I call:
      "Though to prophets list I,
   Which hath understood at all?
      Yea: -- Quem elegisti -- ?"




SURVIEW

   A CRY from the green-grained sticks of the fire
      Made me gaze where it seemed to be:
   'Twas my own voice talking therefrom to me
   On how I had walked when my sun was higher -- 
      My heart in its arrogancy.

   " -- You held not to whatsoever was true -- ,"
      Said my own voice talking to me:
   " -- Whatsoever was just you were slack to see -- ;
   -- Kept not things lovely and pure in view -- ,"
      Said my own voice talking to me.

   " -- You slighted her that endureth all -- ,"
      Said my own voice talking to me;
   " -- Vaunteth not -- , -- trusteth hopefully -- ;
   -- That suffereth long and is kind withal -- ,"
      Said my own voice talking to me.

   " -- You taught not that which you set about -- ,"
      Said my own voice talking to me;
   " -- That the greatest of things is Charity -- . . . "
   -- And the sticks burnt low, and the fire went out,
      And my voice ceased talking to me.


The Waste Land
THE BURIAL OF THE DEAD


  April is the cruellest month, breeding
  Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
  Memory and desire, stirring
  Dull roots with spring rain.
  Winter kept us warm, covering
  Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
  A little life with dried tubers.
  Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee
  With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,
  And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,                            
  And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.

 And when we were children, staying at the archduke's,
  My cousin's, he took me out on a sled,
  And I was frightened. He said, Marie,
  Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.
  In the mountains, there you feel free.
  I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.

  What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow
  Out of this stony rubbish? Son of man,                                  
  You cannot say, or guess, for you know only
  A heap of broken images, where the sun beats,
  And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief,
  And the dry stone no sound of water. Only
  There is shadow under this red rock,
  (Come in under the shadow of this red rock),
  And I will show you something different from either
  Your shadow at morning striding behind you
  Or your shadow at evening rising to meet you;
  I will show you fear in a handful of dust.                              

  "You gave me hyacinths first a year ago;
  "They called me the hyacinth girl."
  -- Yet when we came back, late, from the Hyacinth garden,
  Your arms full, and your hair wet, I could not
  Speak, and my eyes failed, I was neither
  Living nor dead, and I knew nothing,                                    
  Looking into the heart of light, the silence.


  Madame Sosostris, famous clairvoyante,
  Had a bad cold, nevertheless
  Is known to be the wisest woman in Europe,
  With a wicked pack of cards. Here, said she,
  Is your card, the drowned Phoenician Sailor,
  (Those are pearls that were his eyes. Look!)
  Here is Belladonna, the Lady of the Rocks,
  The lady of situations.                                                 
  Here is the man with three staves, and here the Wheel,
  And here is the one-eyed merchant, and this card,
  Which is blank, is something he carries on his back,
  Which I am forbidden to see. I do not find
  The Hanged Man. Fear death by water.
  I see crowds of people, walking round in a ring.
  Thank you. If you see dear Mrs. Equitone,
  Tell her I bring the horoscope myself:
  One must be so careful these days.

  Unreal City,                                                            
  Under the brown fog of a winter dawn,
  A crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many,
  I had not thought death had undone so many.
  Sighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled,
  And each man fixed his eyes before his feet.
  Flowed up the hill and down King William Street,
  To where Saint Mary Woolnoth kept the hours
  With a dead sound on the final stroke of nine.
  There I saw one I knew, and stopped him, crying "Stetson!
  "You who were with me in the ships at Mylae!                            
  "That corpse you planted last year in your garden,
  "Has it begun to sprout? Will it bloom this year?
  "Or has the sudden frost disturbed its bed?
  "Oh keep the Dog far hence, that's friend to men,
  "Or with his nails he'll dig it up again!
  "You! hypocrite lecteur! -- mon semblable, -- mon fr re!"    



A GAME OF CHESS


  The Chair she sat in, like a burnished throne,
  Glowed on the marble, where the glass
  Held up by standards wrought with fruited vines
  From which a golden Cupidon peeped out                                  
  (Another hid his eyes behind his wing)
  Doubled the flames of sevenbranched candelabra
  Reflecting light upon the table as
  The glitter of her jewels rose to meet it,
  From satin cases poured in rich profusion.
  In vials of ivory and coloured glass
  Unstoppered, lurked her strange synthetic perfumes,
  Unguent, powdered, or liquid -- troubled, confused
  And drowned the sense in odours; stirred by the air
  That freshened from the window, these ascended                          
  In fattening the prolonged candle-flames,
  Flung their smoke into the laquearia,
  Stirring the pattern on the coffered ceiling.
  Huge sea-wood fed with copper
  Burned green and orange, framed by the coloured stone,
  In which sad light a carv d dolphin swam.
  Above the antique mantel was displayed
  As though a window gave upon the sylvan scene
  The change of Philomel, by the barbarous king
  So rudely forced; yet there the nightingale                             
  Filled all the desert with inviolable voice
  And still she cried, and still the world pursues,
  "Jug Jug" to dirty ears.
  And other withered stumps of time
  Were told upon the walls; staring forms
  Leaned out, leaning, hushing the room enclosed.
  Footsteps shuffled on the stair.
  Under the firelight, under the brush, her hair
  Spread out in fiery points
  Glowed into words, then would be savagely still.                        

  "My nerves are bad to-night. Yes, bad. Stay with me.
  "Speak to me. Why do you never speak. Speak.
  "What are you thinking of? What thinking? What?
  "I never know what you are thinking. Think."

  I think we are in rats' alley
  Where the dead men lost their bones.

  "What is that noise?"
                               The wind under the door.
  "What is that noise now? What is the wind doing?"
                               Nothing again nothing.                     
                                                                    "Do
  "You know nothing? Do you see nothing? Do you remember
  "Nothing?"

     I remember
  Those are pearls that were his eyes.
  "Are you alive, or not? Is there nothing in your head?"
                                                                      But
  O O O O that Shakespeherian Rag -- 
  It's so elegant
  So intelligent                                                          
  "What shall I do now? What shall I do?"
  I shall rush out as I am, and walk the street
  "With my hair down, so. What shall we do tomorrow?
  "What shall we ever do?"
                                       The hot water at ten.
  And if it rains, a closed car at four.
  And we shall play a game of chess,
  Pressing lidless eyes and waiting for a knock upon the door.

  When Lil's husband got demobbed, I said -- 
  I didn't mince my words, I said to her myself,                          
  HURRY UP PLEASE IT'S TIME
  Now Albert's coming back, make yourself a bit smart.
  He'll want to know what you done with that money he gave you
  To get yourself some teeth. He did, I was there.
  You have them all out, Lil, and get a nice set,
  He said, I swear, I can't bear to look at you.
  And no more can't I, I said, and think of poor Albert,
  He's been in the army four years, he wants a good time,
  And if you don't give it him, there's others will, I said.
  Oh is there, she said. Something o' that, I said.                       
  Then I'll know who to thank, she said, and give me a straight look.
  HURRY UP PLEASE IT'S TIME
  If you don't like it you can get on with it, I said.
  Others can pick and choose if you can't.
  But if Albert makes off, it won't be for lack of telling.
  You ought to be ashamed, I said, to look so antique.
  (And her only thirty-one.)
  I can't help it, she said, pulling a long face,
  It's them pills I took, to bring it off, she said.
  (She's had five already, and nearly died of young George.)              
  The chemist said it would be all right, but I've never been the same.
  You _are_ a proper fool, I said.
  Well, if Albert won't leave you alone, there it is, I said,
  What you get married for if you don't want children?
  HURRY UP PLEASE IT'S TIME
  Well, that Sunday Albert was home, they had a hot gammon,
  And they asked me in to dinner, to get the beauty of it hot -- 
  HURRY UP PLEASE IT'S TIME
  HURRY UP PLEASE IT'S TIME
  Goonight Bill. Goonight Lou. Goonight May. Goonight.                    
  Ta ta. Goonight. Goonight.
  Good night, ladies, good night, sweet ladies, good night, good night.    




     THE FIRE SERMON


  The river's tent is broken: the last fingers of leaf
  Clutch and sink into the wet bank. The wind
  Crosses the brown land, unheard. The nymphs are departed.
  Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.
  The river bears no empty bottles, sandwich papers,
  Silk handkerchiefs, cardboard boxes, cigarette ends
  Or other testimony of summer nights. The nymphs are departed.
  And their friends, the loitering heirs of city directors;               
  Departed, have left no addresses.
  By the waters of Leman I sat down and wept . . .
  Sweet Thames, run softly till I end my song,
  Sweet Thames, run softly, for I speak not loud or long.
  But at my back in a cold blast I hear
  The rattle of the bones, and chuckle spread from ear to ear.
  A rat crept softly through the vegetation
  Dragging its slimy belly on the bank
  While I was fishing in the dull canal
  On a winter evening round behind the gashouse                           
  Musing upon the king my brother's wreck
  And on the king my father's death before him.
  White bodies naked on the low damp ground
  And bones cast in a little low dry garret,
  Rattled by the rat's foot only, year to year.
  But at my back from time to time I hear
  The sound of horns and motors, which shall bring
  Sweeney to Mrs. Porter in the spring.
  O the moon shone bright on Mrs. Porter
  And on her daughter                                                     
  They wash their feet in soda water
  _Et O ces voix d'enfants, chantant dans la coupole!_

  Twit twit twit
  Jug jug jug jug jug jug
  So rudely forc'd.
  Tereu

  Unreal City
  Under the brown fog of a winter noon
  Mr. Eugenides, the Smyrna merchant
  Unshaven, with a pocket full of currants                                
  C.i.f. London: documents at sight,
  Asked me in demotic French
  To luncheon at the Cannon Street Hotel
  Followed by a weekend at the Metropole.

  At the violet hour, when the eyes and back
  Turn upward from the desk, when the human engine waits
  Like a taxi throbbing waiting,
  I Tiresias, though blind, throbbing between two lives,
  Old man with wrinkled female breasts, can see
  At the violet hour, the evening hour that strives                       
  Homeward, and brings the sailor home from sea,
  The typist home at teatime, clears her breakfast, lights
  Her stove, and lays out food in tins.
  Out of the window perilously spread
  Her drying combinations touched by the sun's last rays,
  On the divan are piled (at night her bed)
  Stockings, slippers, camisoles, and stays.
  I Tiresias, old man with wrinkled dugs
  Perceived the scene, and foretold the rest -- 
  I too awaited the expected guest.                                       
  He, the young man carbuncular, arrives,
  A small house agent's clerk, with one bold stare,
  One of the low on whom assurance sits
  As a silk hat on a Bradford millionaire.
  The time is now propitious, as he guesses,
  The meal is ended, she is bored and tired,
  Endeavours to engage her in caresses
  Which still are unreproved, if undesired.
  Flushed and decided, he assaults at once;
  Exploring hands encounter no defence;                                   
  His vanity requires no response,
  And makes a welcome of indifference.
  (And I Tiresias have foresuffered all
  Enacted on this same divan or bed;
  I who have sat by Thebes below the wall
  And walked among the lowest of the dead.)
  Bestows one final patronising kiss,
  And gropes his way, finding the stairs unlit . . .

  She turns and looks a moment in the glass,
  Hardly aware of her departed lover;                                     
  Her brain allows one half-formed thought to pass:
  "Well now that's done: and I'm glad it's over."
  When lovely woman stoops to folly and
  Paces about her room again, alone,
  She smooths her hair with automatic hand,
  And puts a record on the gramophone.

  "This music crept by me upon the waters"
  And along the Strand, up Queen Victoria Street.
  O City city, I can sometimes hear
  Beside a public bar in Lower Thames Street,                             
  The pleasant whining of a mandoline
  And a clatter and a chatter from within
  Where fishmen lounge at noon: where the walls
  Of Magnus Martyr hold
  Inexplicable splendour of Ionian white and gold.

       The river sweats
       Oil and tar
       The barges drift
       With the turning tide
       Red sails                                                          
       Wide
       To leeward, swing on the heavy spar.
       The barges wash
       Drifting logs
       Down Greenwich reach
       Past the Isle of Dogs.

       The stern was formed
       A gilded shell
       Red and gold
       The brisk swell

  "Trams and dusty trees.
  Highbury bore me. Richmond and Kew
  Undid me. By Richmond I raised my knees
  Supine on the floor of a narrow canoe."

DEATH BY WATER


  Phlebas the Phoenician, a fortnight dead,
  Forgot the cry of gulls, and the deep sea swell
  And the profit and loss.
                                           A current under sea
  Picked his bones in whispers. As he rose and fell
  He passed the stages of his age and youth
  Entering the whirlpool.
                                         Gentile or Jew
  O you who turn the wheel and look to windward,                          
  Consider Phlebas, who was once handsome and tall as you.    




WHAT THE THUNDER SAID


  After the torchlight red on sweaty faces
  After the frosty silence in the gardens
  After the agony in stony places
  The shouting and the crying
  Prison and palace and reverberation
  Of thunder of spring over distant mountains
  He who was living is now dead
  We who were living are now dying
  With a little patience                                                  

  Here is no water but only rock
  Rock and no water and the sandy road
  The road winding above among the mountains
  Which are mountains of rock without water
  If there were water we should stop and drink
  Amongst the rock one cannot stop or think
  Sweat is dry and feet are in the sand
  If there were only water amongst the rock
  Dead mountain mouth of carious teeth that cannot spit
  Here one can neither stand nor lie nor sit                              
  There is not even silence in the mountains
  But dry sterile thunder without rain
  There is not even solitude in the mountains
  But red sullen faces sneer and snarl
  From doors of mudcracked houses
                                                           If there were water
  And no rock
  If there were rock
  And also water
  And water                                                               
  A spring
  A pool among the rock
  If there were the sound of water only
  Not the cicada
  And dry grass singing
  But sound of water over a rock
  Where the hermit-thrush sings in the pine trees
  Drip drop drip drop drop drop drop
  But there is no water

  Who is the third who walks always beside you?
  When I count, there are only you and I together                         
  But when I look ahead up the white road
  There is always another one walking beside you
  Gliding wrapt in a brown mantle, hooded
  I do not know whether a man or a woman
  -- But who is that on the other side of you?

  What is that sound high in the air
  Murmur of maternal lamentation
  Who are those hooded hordes swarming
  Over endless plains, stumbling in cracked earth
  Ringed by the flat horizon only                                         
  What is the city over the mountains
  Cracks and reforms and bursts in the violet air
  Falling towers
  Jerusalem Athens Alexandria
  Vienna London
  Unreal

  A woman drew her long black hair out tight
  And fiddled whisper music on those strings
  And bats with baby faces in the violet light
  Whistled, and beat their wings                                          
  And crawled head downward down a blackened wall
  And upside down in air were towers
  Tolling reminiscent bells, that kept the hours
  And voices singing out of empty cisterns and exhausted wells.

  In this decayed hole among the mountains
  In the faint moonlight, the grass is singing
  Over the tumbled graves, about the chapel
  There is the empty chapel, only the wind's home.
  It has no windows, and the door swings,
  Dry bones can harm no one.                                              
  Only a cock stood on the rooftree
  Co co rico co co rico
  In a flash of lightning. Then a damp gust
  Bringing rain

  Ganga was sunken, and the limp leaves
  Waited for rain, while the black clouds
  Gathered far distant, over Himavant.
  The jungle crouched, humped in silence.
  Then spoke the thunder
  DA                                                                      
  _Datta:_ what have we given?
  My friend, blood shaking my heart
  The awful daring of a moment's surrender
  Which an age of prudence can never retract
  By this, and this only, we have existed
  Which is not to be found in our obituaries
  Or in memories draped by the beneficent spider
  Or under seals broken by the lean solicitor
  In our empty rooms
  DA                                                                      
  _Dayadhvam:_ I have heard the key
  Turn in the door once and turn once only
  We think of the key, each in his prison
  Thinking of the key, each confirms a prison
  Only at nightfall, aetherial rumours
  Revive for a moment a broken Coriolanus
  DA
  _Damyata:_ The boat responded
  Gaily, to the hand expert with sail and oar
  The sea was calm, your heart would have responded                       
  Gaily, when invited, beating obedient
  To controlling hands

                                       I sat upon the shore
  Fishing, with the arid plain behind me
  Shall I at least set my lands in order?
  London Bridge is falling down falling down falling down
  _Poi s'ascose nel foco che gli affina
  Quando fiam ceu chelidon_ -- O swallow swallow
  _Le Prince d'Aquitaine   la tour abolie_
  These fragments I have shored against my ruins                          
  Why then Ile fit you. Hieronymo's mad againe.
  Datta. Dayadhvam. Damyata.

Birds, Beasts and Flowers

FRUITS




POMEGRANATE


    You tell me I am wrong.
    Who are you, who is anybody to tell me I am wrong?
    I am not wrong.

    In Syracuse, rock left bare by the viciousness of Greek women,
    No doubt you have forgotten the pomegranate-trees in flower,
    Oh so red, and such a lot of them.

    Whereas at Venice
    Abhorrent, green, slippery city
    Whose Doges were old, and had ancient eyes,
    In the dense foliage of the inner garden
    Pomegranates like bright green stone,
    And barbed, barbed with a crown.
    Oh, crown of spiked green metal
    Actually growing!

    Now in Tuscany,
    Pomegranates to warm your hands at;
    And crowns, kingly, generous, tilting crowns
    Over the left eyebrow.

    And, if you dare, the fissure!

    Do you mean to tell me you will see no fissure?
    Do you prefer to look on the plain side?

    For all that, the setting suns are open.
    The end cracks open with the beginning:
    Rosy, tender, glittering within the fissure.

    Do you mean to tell me there should be no fissure?
    No glittering, compact drops of dawn?
    Do you mean it is wrong, the gold-filmed skin, integument, shown ruptured?

    For my part, I prefer my heart to be broken.
    It is so lovely, dawn-kaleidoscopic within the crack.





PEACH


    Would you like to throw a stone at me?
    Here, take all that's left of my peach.

    Blood-red, deep;
    Heaven knows how it came to pass.
    Somebody's pound of flesh rendered up.

    Wrinkled with secrets
    And hard with the intention to keep them.

    Why, from silvery peach-bloom,
    From that shallow-silvery wine-glass on a short stem
    This rolling, dropping, heavy globule?

    I am thinking, of course, of the peach before I ate it.

    Why so velvety, why so voluptuous heavy?
    Why hanging with such inordinate weight?
    Why so indented?

    Why the groove?
    Why the lovely, bivalve roundnesses?
    Why the ripple down the sphere?
    Why the suggestion of incision?

    Why was not my peach round and finished like a billiard ball?
    It would have been if man had made it.
    Though I've eaten it now.

    But it wasn't round and finished like a billiard ball.
    And because I say so, you would like to throw something at me.

    Here, you can have my peach stone.

MEDLARS AND SORB-APPLES


    I love you, rotten,
    Delicious rottenness.

    I love to suck you out from your skins
    So brown and soft and coming suave,
    So morbid, as the Italians say.

    What a rare, powerful, reminiscent flavour
    Comes out of your falling through the stages of decay:
    Stream within stream.

    Something of the same flavour as Syracusan muscat wine
    Or vulgar Marsala.

    Though even the word Marsala will smack of preciosity
    Soon in the pussy-foot West.

    What is it?
    What is it, in the grape turning raisin,
    In the medlar, in the sorb-apple,
    Wineskins of brown morbidity,
    Autumnal excrementa;
    What is it that reminds us of white gods?

    Gods nude as blanched nut-kernels,
    Strangely, half-sinisterly flesh-fragrant
    As if with sweat,
    And drenched with mystery.

    Sorb-apples, medlars with dead crowns.

    I say, wonderful are the hellish experiences
    Orphic, delicate
    Dionysos of the Underworld.

    A kiss, and a vivid spasm of farewell, a moment's orgasm of rupture,
    Then along the damp road alone, till the next turning.
    And there, a new partner, a new parting, a new unfusing into twain,
    A new gasp of further isolation,
    A new intoxication of loneliness, among decaying, frost-cold leaves.

    Going down the strange lanes of hell, more and more intensely alone,
    The fibres of the heart parting one after the other
    And yet the soul continuing, naked-footed, ever more vividly embodied
    Like a flame blown whiter and whiter
    In a deeper and deeper darkness
    Ever more exquisite, distilled in separation.

    So, in the strange retorts of medlars and sorb-apples
    The distilled essence of hell.
    The exquisite odour of leave-taking.
          _Jamque vale!_
    Orpheus, and the winding, leaf-clogged, silent lanes of hell.

    Each soul departing with its own isolation,
    Strangest of all strange companions,
    And best.

    Medlars, sorb-apples
    More than sweet
    Flux of autumn
    Sucked out of your empty bladders
    And sipped down, perhaps, with a sip of Marsala
    So that the rambling, sky-dropped grape can add its music to yours,
    Orphic farewell, and farewell, and farewell
    And the _ego sum_ of Dionysos
    The _sono io_ of perfect drunkenness
    Intoxication of final loneliness.





FIGS


    The proper way to eat a fig, in society,
    Is to split it in four, holding it by the stump,
    And open it, so that it is a glittering, rosy, moist, honied,
           heavy-petalled four-petalled flower.

    Then you throw away the skin
    Which is just like a four-sepalled calyx,
    After you have taken off the blossom with your lips.

    But the vulgar way
    Is just to put your mouth to the crack, and
           take out the flesh in one bite.

    Every fruit has its secret.

    The fig is a very secretive fruit.
    As you see it standing growing, you feel at once it is symbolic:
    And it seems male.
    But when you come to know it better, you agree
           with the Romans, it is female.

    The Italians vulgarly say, it stands for the female part; the fig-fruit:
    The fissure, the yoni,
    The wonderful moist conductivity towards the centre.

    Involved,
    Inturned,
    The flowering all inward and womb-fibrilled;
    And but one orifice.

    The fig, the horse-shoe, the squash-blossom.
    Symbols.

    There was a flower that flowered inward, womb-ward;
    Now there is a fruit like a ripe womb.

    It was always a secret.
    That's how it should be, the female should always be secret.

    There never was any standing aloft and unfolded on a bough
    Like other flowers, in a revelation of petals;
    Silver-pink peach, Venetian green glass of medlars and sorb-apples,
    Shallow wine-cups on short, bulging stems
    Openly pledging heaven:
    _Here's to the thorn in flower! Here is to Utterance!_
    The brave, adventurous rosaceae.

    Folded upon itself, and secret unutterable,
    And milky-sapped, sap that curdles milk and makes ricotta,
    Sap that smells strange on your fingers, that even goats won't taste it;
    Folded upon itself, enclosed like any Mohammedan woman,
    Its nakedness all within-walls, its flowering forever unseen,
    One small way of access only, and this close-curtained from the light;
    Fig, fruit of the female mystery, covert and inward,
    Mediterranean fruit, with your covert nakedness,
    Where everything happens invisible, flowering and
           fertilisation, and fruiting
    In the inwardness of your you, that eye will never see
    Till it's finished, and you're over-ripe, and you
           burst to give up your ghost.

    Till the drop of ripeness exudes,
    And the year is over.

    And then the fig has kept her secret long enough.
    So it explodes, and you see through the fissure the scarlet.
    And the fig is finished, the year is over.

    That's how the fig dies, showing her crimson through the purple slit
    Like a wound, the exposure of her secret, on the open day.
    Like a prostitute, the bursten fig, making a show of her secret.

    That's how women die too.

    The year is fallen over-ripe,
    The year of our women.
    The year of our women is fallen over-ripe.
    The secret is laid bare.
    And rottenness soon sets in.
    The year of our women is fallen over-ripe.

    When Eve once knew _in her mind_ that she was naked
    She quickly sewed fig-leaves, and sewed the same for the man.
    She'd been naked all her days before,
    But till then, till that apple of knowledge, she hadn't
           had the fact on her mind.

    She got the fact on her mind, and quickly sewed fig-leaves.
    And women have been sewing ever since.
    But now they stitch to adorn the bursten fig, not to cover it.
    They have their nakedness more than ever on their mind,
    And they won't let us forget it.

    Now, the secret
    Becomes an affirmation through moist, scarlet lips
    That laugh at the Lord's indignation.

    _What then, good Lord!_ cry the women.
    _We have kept our secret long enough._
    _We are a ripe fig._
    _Let us burst into affirmation._

    They forget, ripe figs won't keep.
    Ripe figs won't keep.

    Honey-white figs of the north, black figs
           with scarlet inside, of the south.
    Ripe figs won't keep, won't keep in any clime.
    What then, when women the world over have all bursten into affirmation?
    And bursten figs won't keep?





GRAPES


    So many fruits come from roses
    From the rose of all roses
    From the unfolded rose
    Rose of all the world.

    Admit that apples and strawberries and peaches and pears and blackberries
    Are all Rosaceae,
    Issue of the explicit rose,
    The open-countenanced, skyward-smiling rose.

    What then of the vine?
    Oh, what of the tendrilled vine?

    Ours is the universe of the unfolded rose,
    The explicit,
    The candid revelation.

    But long ago, oh, long ago
    Before the rose began to simper supreme,
    Before the rose of all roses, rose of all the world, was even in bud,
    Before the glaciers were gathered up in a bunch out
           of the unsettled seas and winds,
    Or else before they had been let down again, in Noah's flood,
    There was another world, a dusky, flowerless, tendrilled world
    And creatures webbed and marshy,
    And on the margin, men soft-footed and pristine,
    Still, and sensitive, and active,
    Audile, tactile sensitiveness as of a tendril
           which orientates and reaches out,
    Reaching out and grasping by an instinct more
           delicate than the moon's as she feels for the tides.

    Of which world, the vine was the invisible rose,
    Before petals spread, before colour made its
           disturbance, before eyes saw too much.

    In a green, muddy, web-foot, unutterably songless world
    The vine was rose of all roses.

    There were no poppies or carnations,
    Hardly a greenish lily, watery faint.
    Green, dim, invisible flourishing of vines
    Royally gesticulate.

    Look now even now, how it keeps its power of invisibility
    Look how black, how blue-black, how globed in Egyptian darkness
    Dropping among his leaves, hangs the dark grape!
    See him there, the swart, so palpably invisible:
    Whom shall we ask about him?

    The negro might know a little.
    When the vine was rose, Gods were dark-skinned.
    Bacchus is a dream's dream.
    Once God was all negroid, as now he is fair.
    But it's so long ago, the ancient Bushman has forgotten
           more utterly than we, who have never known.

    For we are on the brink of re-remembrance.
    Which, I suppose, is why America has gone dry.
    Our pale day is sinking into twilight,
    And if we sip the wine, we find dreams coming upon us
    Out of the imminent night.
    Nay, we find ourselves crossing the fern-scented frontiers
    Of the world before the floods, where man was dark and evasive
    And the tiny vine-flower rose of all roses, perfumed,
    And all in naked communion communicating as now our
           clothed vision can never communicate.
    Vistas, down dark avenues
    As we sip the wine.

    The grape is swart, the avenues dusky and tendrilled, subtly prehensile,
    But we, as we start awake, clutch at our vistas democratic,
           boulevards, tram-cars, policemen.
    Give us our own back
    Let us go to the soda-fountain, to get sober.

    Soberness, sobriety.
    It is like the agonised perverseness of a child heavy with sleep,
           yet fighting, fighting to keep awake;
    Soberness, sobriety, with heavy eyes propped open.

    Dusky are the avenues of wine,
    And we must cross the frontiers, though we will not,
    Of the lost, fern-scented world:
    Take the fern-seed on our lips,
    Close the eyes, and go
    Down the tendrilled avenues of wine and the otherworld.





THE REVOLUTIONARY


    Look at them standing there in authority
    The pale-faces,
    As if it could have any effect any more.

    Pale-face authority,
    Caryatids,
    Pillars of white bronze standing rigid, lest the skies fall.

    What a job they've got to keep it up.
    Their poor, idealist foreheads naked capitals
    To the entablature of clouded heaven.

    When the skies are going to fall, fall they will
    In a great chute and rush of d b cle downwards.

    Oh and I wish the high and super-gothic heavens would come down now,
    The heavens above, that we yearn to and aspire to.

    I do not yearn, nor aspire, for I am a blind Samson.
    And what is daylight to me that I should look skyward?
    Only I grope among you, pale-faces, caryatids, as among a forest of pillars
           that hold up the dome of high ideal heaven
    Which is my prison,
    And all these human pillars of loftiness, going stiff, metallic-stunned
           with the weight of their responsibility
    I stumble against them.
    Stumbling-blocks, painful ones.

    To keep on holding up this ideal civilisation
    Must be excruciating: unless you stiffen into metal, when it is easier to
        stand stock rigid than to move.

    This is why I tug at them, individually, with my arm round their waist
    The human pillars.
    They are not stronger than I am, blind Samson.
    The house sways.

    I shall be so glad when it comes down.
    I am so tired of the limitations of their Infinite.
    I am so sick of the pretensions of the Spirit.
    I am so weary of pale-face importance.

    Am I not blind, at the round-turning mill?
    Then why should I fear their pale faces?
    Or love the effulgence of their holy light,
    The sun of their righteousness?

    To me, all faces are dark,
    All lips are dusky and valved.

    Save your lips, O pale-faces,
    Which are slips of metal,
    Like slits in an automatic-machine, you columns of give-and-take.

    To me, the earth rolls ponderously, superbly
    Coming my way without forethought or afterthought.
    To me, men's footfalls fall with a dull, soft rumble, ominous and lovely,
    Coming my way.

    But not your foot-falls, pale-faces,
    They are a clicketing of bits of disjointed metal
    Working in motion.

    To me, men are palpable, invisible nearnesses in the dark
    Sending out magnetic vibrations of warning, pitch-dark throbs of invitation.

    But you, pale-faces,
    You are painful, harsh-surfaced pillars that give off nothing except rigidity,
    And I jut against you if I try to move, for you are everywhere, and I
        am blind,
    Sightless among all your visuality,
    You staring caryatids.

    See if I don't bring you down, and all your high opinion
    And all your ponderous roofed-in erection of right and wrong
    Your particular heavens,
    With a smash.

    See if your skies aren't falling!
    And my head, at least, is thick enough to stand it, the smash.

    See if I don't move under a dark and nude, vast heaven
    When your world is in ruins, under your fallen skies.
    Caryatids, pale-faces.
    See if I am not Lord of the dark and moving hosts
    Before I die.





THE EVENING LAND


    Oh America
    The sun sets in you.
    Are you the grave of our day?

    Shall I come to you, the open tomb of my race?

    I would come, if I felt my hour had struck.
    I would rather you came to me.

    For that matter
    Mahomet never went to any mountain
    Save it had first approached him and cajoled his soul.

    You have cajoled the souls of millions of us
    America,
    Why won't you cajole my soul?
    I wish you would.

    I confess I am afraid of you.

    The catastrophe of your exaggerate love,
    You who never find yourself in love
    But only lose yourself further, decomposing.

    You who never recover from out of the orgasm of loving
    Your pristine, isolate integrity, lost aeons ago.
    Your singleness within the universe.

    You who in loving break down
    And break further and further down
    Your bounds of isolation,
    But who never rise, resurrected, from this grave of mingling,
    In a new proud singleness, America.

    Your more-than-European idealism,
    Like a be-aureoled bleached skeleton hovering
    Its cage-ribs in the social heaven, beneficent.

    And then your single resurrection
    Into machine-uprisen perfect man.

    Even the winged skeleton of your bleached ideal
    Is not so frightening as that clean smooth
    Automaton of your uprisen self,
    Machine American.

    Do you wonder that I am afraid to come
    And answer the first machine-cut question from the lips of your iron men?
    Put the first cents into metallic fingers of your officers
    And sit beside the steel-straight arms of your fair women
    American?

    This may be a withering tree, this Europe,
    But here, even a customs-official is still vulnerable.

    I am so terrified, America,
    Of the iron click of your human contact.
    And after this
    The winding-sheet of your self-less ideal love.
    Boundless love
    Like a poison gas.

    Does no one realise that love should be intense, individual,
    Not boundless.
    This boundless love is like the bad smell
    Of something gone wrong in the middle.
    All this philanthropy and benevolence on other people's behalf
    Just a bad smell.

    Yet, America,
    Your elvishness,
    Your New England uncanniness,
    Your western brutal faery quality.

    My soul is half-cajoled, half-cajoled.

    Something in you which carries me beyond
    Yankee, Yankee,
    What we call human.
    Carries me where I want to be carried ...
    Or don't I?

    What does it matter
    What we call human, and what we don't call human?
    The rose would smell as sweet.
    And to be limited by a mere word is to be less than a hopping flea, which
        hops over such an obstruction at first jump.

    Your horrible, skeleton, aureoled ideal,
    Your weird bright motor-productive mechanism,
    Two spectres.

    But moreover
    A dark, unfathomed will, that is not un-Jewish;
    A set, stoic endurance, non-European;
    An ultimate desperateness, un-African;
    A deliberate generosity, non-Oriental.

    The strange, unaccustomed geste of your demonish New World nature
    Glimpsed now and then.

    Nobody knows you.
    You don't know yourself.
    And I, who am half in love with you,
    What am I in love with?
    My own imaginings?

    Say it is not so.

    Say, through the branches
    America, America
    Of all your machines,
    Say, in the deep sockets of your idealistic skull,
    Dark, aboriginal eyes
    Stoic, able to wait through ages
    Glancing.

    Say, in the sound of all your machines
    And white words, white-wash American,
    Deep pulsing of a strange heart
    New throb, like a stirring under the false dawn that precedes the real.

    Nascent American
    Demonish, lurking among the undergrowth
    Of many-stemmed machines and chimneys that smoke like pine-trees.

    Dark, elvish,
    Modern, unissued, uncanny America,
    Your nascent demon people
    Lurking among the deeps of your industrial thicket
    Allure me till I am beside myself,
    A nympholepht.

    These States! as Whitman said,
    Whatever he meant.





PEACE


    Peace is written on the doorstep
    In lava.

    Peace, black peace congealed.
    My heart will know no peace
    Till the hill bursts.

    Brilliant, intolerable lava
    Brilliant as a powerful burning-glass
    Walking like a royal snake down the mountain towards the sea.

    Forests, cities, bridges
    Gone again in the bright trail of lava.
    Naxos thousands of feet below the olive-roots,
    And now the olive leaves thousands of feet below the lava fire.

    Peace congealed in black lava on the doorstep.
    Within, white-hot lava, never at peace
    Till it burst forth blinding, withering the earth;
    To set again into rock
    Grey-black rock.

    Call it Peace?





TREES




CYPRESSES


    Tuscan cypresses,
    What is it?

    Folded in like a dark thought
    For which the language is lost,
    Tuscan cypresses,
    Is there a great secret?
    Are our words no good?

    The undeliverable secret,
    Dead with a dead race and a dead speech, and yet
    Darkly monumental in you,
    Etruscan cypresses.

    Ah, how I admire your fidelity,
    Dark cypresses,

    Is it the secret of the long-nosed Etruscans?
    The long-nosed, sensitive-footed, subtly-smiling Etruscans,
    Who made so little noise outside the cypress groves?

    Among the sinuous, flame-tall cypresses
    That swayed their length of darkness all around
    Etruscan-dusky, wavering men of old Etruria:
    Naked except for fanciful long shoes,
    Going with insidious, half-smiling quietness
    And some of Africa's imperturbable sang-froid
    About a forgotten business.

    What business, then?
    Nay, tongues are dead, and words are hollow as hollow seed-pods,
    Having shed their sound and finished all their echoing
    Etruscan syllables,
    That had the telling.

    Yet more I see you darkly concentrate,
    Tuscan cypresses,
    On one old thought:
    On one old slim imperishable thought, while you remain
    Etruscan cypresses;
    Dusky, slim marrow-thought of slender, flickering men of Etruria,
    Whom Rome called vicious.

    Vicious, dark cypresses:
    Vicious, you supple, brooding, softly-swaying pillars of dark flame.
    Monumental to a dead, dead race
    Embalmed in you!

    Were they then vicious, the slender, tender-footed,
    Long-nosed men of Etruria?
    Or was their way only evasive and different, dark, like cypress-trees
        in a wind?

    They are dead, with all their vices,
    And all that is left
    Is the shadowy monomania of some cypresses
    And tombs.

    The smile, the subtle Etruscan smile still lurking
    Within the tombs,
    Etruscan cypresses.
    He laughs longest who laughs last;
    Nay, Leonardo only bungled the pure Etruscan smile.

    What would I not give
    To bring back the rare and orchid-like
    Evil-yclept Etruscan?

    For as to the evil
    We have only Roman word for it,
    Which I, being a little weary of Roman virtue,
    Don't hang much weight on.

    For oh, I know, in the dust where we have buried
    The silenced races and all their abominations,
    We have buried so much of the delicate magic of life.

    There in the deeps
    That churn the frankincense and ooze the myrrh,
    Cypress shadowy,
    Such an aroma of lost human life!

    They say the fit survive,
    But I invoke the spirits of the lost.
    Those that have not survived, the darkly lost,
    To bring their meaning back into life again,
    Which they have taken away
    And wrapt inviolable in soft cypress-trees,
    Etruscan cypresses.

    Evil, what is evil?
    There is only one evil, to deny life
    As Rome denied Etruria
    And mechanical America Montezuma still.
                   _Fiesole.



BARE FIG-TREES


    Fig-trees, weird fig-trees
    Made of thick smooth silver,
    Made of sweet, untarnished silver in the sea-southern air -- 
    I say untarnished, but I mean opaque -- 
    Thick, smooth-fleshed silver, dull only as human limbs are dull
    With the life-lustre,
    Nude with the dim light of full, healthy life
    That is always half-dark,
    And suave like passion-flower petals,
    Like passion-flowers,
    With the half-secret gleam of a passion-flower hanging from the rock,
    Great, complicated, nude fig-tree, stemless flower-mesh,
    Flowerily naked in flesh, and giving off hues of life.

    Rather like an octopus, but strange and sweet-myriad-limbed octopus;
    Like a nude, like a rock-living, sweet-fleshed sea-anemone,
    Flourishing from the rock in a mysterious arrogance.

    Let me sit down beneath the many-branching candelabrum
    That lives upon this rock
    And laugh at Time, and laugh at dull Eternity,
    And make a joke of stale Infinity,
    Within the flesh-scent of this wicked tree,
    That has kept so many secrets up its sleeve,
    And has been laughing through so many ages
    At man and his uncomfortablenesses,
    And his attempt to assure himself that what is so is not so,
    Up its sleeve.

    Let me sit down beneath this many-branching candelabrum,
    The Jewish seven-branched, tallow-stinking candlestick kicked over the cliff
    And all its tallow righteousness got rid of,
    And let me notice it behave itself.

    And watch it putting forth each time to heaven,
    Each time straight to heaven,
    With marvellous naked assurance each single twig
    Each one setting off straight to the sky
    As if it were the leader, the main-stem, the forerunner,
    Intent to hold the candle of the sun upon its socket-tip,
    It alone.

    Every young twig
    No sooner issued sideways from the thigh of his predecessor
    Than off he starts without a qualm
    To hold the one and only lighted candle of the sun in his socket-tip.
    He casually gives birth to another young bud from his thigh,
    Which at once sets off to be the one and only,
    And hold the lighted candle of the sun.

    Oh many-branching candelabrum, oh strange up-starting fig-tree,
    Oh weird Demos, where every twig is the arch twig,
    Each imperiously over-equal to each, equality over-reaching itself
    Like the snakes on Medusa's head,
    Oh naked fig-tree!

    Still, no doubt every one of you can be the sun-socket as well as every
       other of you.
    Demos, Demos, Demos!
    Demon, too,
    Wicked fig-tree, equality puzzle, with your self-conscious secret fruits.





BARE ALMOND-TREES


    Wet almond-trees, in the rain,
    Like iron sticking grimly out of earth;
    Black almond trunks, in the rain,
    Like iron implements twisted, hideous, out of the earth,
    Out of the deep, soft fledge of Sicilian winter-green,
    Earth-grass uneatable,
    Almond trunks curving blackly, iron-dark, climbing the slopes.

    Almond-tree, beneath the terrace rail,
    Black, rusted, iron trunk,
    You have welded your thin stems finer,
    Like steel, like sensitive steel in the air,
    Grey, lavender, sensitive steel, curving thinly and brittly up in a parabola.

    What are you doing in the December rain?
    Have you a strange electric sensitiveness in your steel tips?
    Do you feel the air for electric influences
    Like some strange magnetic apparatus?
    Do you take in messages, in some strange code,
    From heaven's wolfish, wandering electricity, that prowls so constantly
       round Etna?
    Do you take the whisper of sulphur from the air?
    Do you hear the chemical accents of the sun?
    Do you telephone the roar of the waters over the earth?
    And from all this, do you make calculations?

    Sicily, December's Sicily in a mass of rain
    With iron branching blackly, rusted like old, twisted implements
    And brandishing and stooping over earth's wintry fledge, climbing the slopes
    Of uneatable soft green!





TROPIC


    Sun, dark sun
    Sun of black void heat
    Sun of the torrid mid-day's horrific darkness.

    Behold my hair twisting and going black.
    Behold my eyes turn tawny yellow
    Negroid;
    See the milk of northern spume
    Coagulating and going black in my veins
    Aromatic as frankincense.

    Columns dark and soft
    Sunblack men
    Soft shafts, sunbreathing mouths
    Eyes of yellow, golden sand
    As frictional, as perilous, explosive as brimstone.

    Rock, waves of dark heat;
    Waves of dark heat, rock, sway upwards
    Waver perpendicular.

    What is the horizontal rolling of water
    Compared to the flood of black heat that rolls upward past my eyes?





SOUTHERN NIGHT


    Come up, thou red thing.
    Come up, and be called a moon.

    The mosquitoes are biting to-night
    Like memories.

    Memories, northern memories,
    Bitter-stinging white world that bore us
    Subsiding into this night.

    Call it moonrise
    This red anathema?

    Rise, thou red thing,
    Unfold slowly upwards, blood-dark;
    Burst the night's membrane of tranquil stars
    Finally.

    Maculate
    The red Macula.





FLOWERS




ALMOND BLOSSOM


    Even iron can put forth,
    Even iron.

    This is the iron age,
    But let us take heart
    Seeing iron break and bud,
    Seeing rusty iron puff with clouds of blossom.

    The almond-tree,
    December's bare iron hooks sticking out of earth.

    The almond-tree,
    That knows the deadliest poison, like a snake
    In supreme bitterness.

    Upon the iron, and upon the steel,
    Odd flakes as if of snow, odd bits of snow,
    Odd crumbs of melting snow.

    But you mistake, it is not from the sky;
    From out the iron, and from out the steel,
    Flying not down from heaven, but storming up,
    Strange storming up from the dense under-earth
    Along the iron, to the living steel
    In rose-hot tips, and flakes of rose-pale snow
    Setting supreme annunciation to the world.

    Nay, what a heart of delicate super-faith,
    Iron-breaking,
    The rusty swords of almond-trees.

    Trees suffer, like races, down the long ages.
    They wander and are exiled, they live in exile through long ages
    Like drawn blades never sheathed, hacked and gone black,
    The alien trees in alien lands: and yet
    The heart of blossom,
    The unquenchable heart of blossom!

    Look at the many-cicatrised frail vine, none more scarred and frail,
    Yet see him fling himself abroad in fresh abandon
    From the small wound-stump.

    Even the wilful, obstinate, gummy fig-tree
    Can be kept down, but he'll burst like a polyp into prolixity.

    And the almond-tree, in exile, in the iron age!

    This is the ancient southern earth whence the vases were baked, amphoras,
        craters, cantharus, oenochoe, and open-hearted cylix,
    Bristling now with the iron of almond-trees

    Iron, but unforgotten,
    Iron, dawn-hearted,
    Ever-beating dawn-heart, enveloped in iron against the exile, against the
        ages.

    See it come forth in blossom
    From the snow-remembering heart
    In long-nighted January,
    In the long dark nights of the evening star, and Sirius,
        and the Etna snow-wind through the long night.

    Sweating his drops of blood through the long-nighted Gethsemane
    Into blossom, into pride, into honey-triumph, into most exquisite splendour.
    Oh, give me the tree of life in blossom
    And the Cross sprouting its superb and fearless flowers!

    Something must be reassuring to the almond, in the evening star, and
        the snow-wind, and the long, long, nights,
    Some memory of far, sun-gentler lands,
    So that the faith in his heart smiles again
    And his blood ripples with that untellable delight of once-more-vindicated
        faith,
    And the Gethsemane blood at the iron pores unfolds, unfolds,
    Pearls itself into tenderness of bud
    And in a great and sacred forthcoming steps forth, steps out in one stride
    A naked tree of blossom, like a bridegroom bathing in dew, divested of cover,
    Frail-naked, utterly uncovered
    To the green night-baying of the dog-star, Etna's snow-edged wind
    And January's loud-seeming sun.

    Think of it, from the iron fastness
    Suddenly to dare to come out naked, in perfection of blossom,
        beyond the sword-rust.
    Think, to stand there in full-unfolded nudity, smiling,
    With all the snow-wind, and the sun-glare, and the dog-star baying epithalamion.

    Oh, honey-bodied beautiful one,
    Come forth from iron,
    Red your heart is.
    Fragile-tender, fragile-tender life-body,
    More fearless than iron all the time,
    And so much prouder, so disdainful of reluctances.

    In the distance like hoar-frost, like silvery ghosts communing on a green
        hill,
    Hoar-frost-like and mysterious.

    In the garden raying out
    With a body like spray, dawn-tender, and looking about
    With such insuperable, subtly-smiling assurance,
    Sword-blade-born.

    Unpromised,
    No bounds being set.
    Flaked out and come unpromised,
    The tree being life-divine,
    Fearing nothing, life-blissful at the core
    Within iron and earth.

    Knots of pink, fish-silvery
    In heaven, in blue, blue heaven,
    Soundless, bliss-full, wide-rayed, honey-bodied,
    Red at the core,
    Red at the core,
    Knotted in heaven upon the fine light.

    Open,
    Open,
    Five times wide open,
    Six times wide open,
    And given, and perfect;
    And red at the core with the last sore-heartedness,
    Sore-hearted-looking.





PURPLE ANEMONES


    _Who gave us flowers?_
    _Heaven? The white God?_

    Nonsense!
    Up out of hell,
    From Hades;
    Infernal Dis!

    _Jesus the god of flowers ---- ?_
    Not he.
    _Or sun-bright Apollo, him so musical?_
    Him neither.

    _Who then?_
    _Say who._
    Say it -- and it is Pluto,
    Dis,
    The dark one,
    Proserpine's master.

    _Who contradicts ---- ?_

    When she broke forth from below,
    Flowers came, hell-hounds on her heels.
    Dis, the dark, the jealous god, the husband,
    Flower-sumptuous-blooded.

    _Go then_, he said.
    And in Sicily, on the meadows of Enna,
    She thought she had left him;
    But opened around her purple anemones,
    Caverns,
    Little hells of colour, caves of darkness,
    Hell, risen in pursuit of her; royal, sumptuous
    Pit-falls.

    All at her feet
    Hell opening;
    At her white ankles
    Hell rearing its husband-splendid, serpent heads,
    Hell-purple, to get at her -- 
    _Why did he let her go?_
    So he could track her down again, white victim.

    Ah mastery!
    Hell's husband-blossoms
    Out on earth again.

    Look out, Persephone!
    You, Madame Ceres, mind yourself, the enemy is upon you.
    About your feet spontaneous aconite,
    Hell-glamorous, and purple husband-tyranny
    Enveloping your late-enfranchised plains.

    You thought your daughter had escaped?
    No more stockings to darn for the flower-roots, down in hell?
    But ah my dear!

    Aha, the stripe-cheeked whelps, whippet-slim crocuses,
    _At 'em, boys, at 'em!_
    _Ho golden-spaniel, sweet alert narcissus,_
    _Smell 'em, smell 'em out!_

    Those two enfranchised women.

    Somebody is coming!
    _Oho there!_

    Dark blue anemones!
    Hell is up!
    Hell on earth, and Dis within the depths!

    _Run, Persephone, he is after you already._

    _Why did he let her go?_
    To track her down;
    All the sport of summer and spring, and flowers
        snapping at her ankles and catching her by the hair!
    Poor Persephone and her rights for women.

    _Husband-snared hell-queen,_
    _It is spring._

    It is spring,
    And pomp of husband-strategy on earth.

    _Ceres, kiss your girl, you think you've got her back._
    _The bit of husband-tilth she is,_
    _Persephone!_

    Poor mothers-in-law!
    They are always sold.

    It is spring.





SICILIAN CYCLAMENS


    When he pushed his bush of black hair off his brow:
    When she lifted her mop from her eyes, and screwed it in a knob behind
         -- O act of fearful temerity!
    When they felt their foreheads bare, naked to heaven, their eyes revealed:
    When they felt the light of heaven brandished like a knife at their defenceless eyes,
    And the sea like a blade at their face,
    Mediterranean savages:
    When they came out, face-revealed, under heaven, from the shaggy undergrowth
         of their own hair
    For the first time,
    They saw tiny rose cyclamens between their toes, growing
    Where the slow toads sat brooding on the past.

    Slow toads, and cyclamen leaves
    Stickily glistening with eternal shadow
    Keeping to earth.
    Cyclamen leaves
    Toad-filmy, earth-iridescent
    Beautiful
    Frost-filigreed
    Spumed with mud
    Snail-nacreous
    Low down.

    The shaking aspect of the sea
    And man's defenceless bare face
    And cyclamens putting their ears back.

    Long, pensive, slim-muzzled greyhound buds
    Dreamy, not yet present,
    Drawn out of earth
    At his toes.

    Dawn-rose
    Sub-delighted, stone-engendered
    Cyclamens, young cyclamens
    Arching
    Waking, pricking their ears
    Like delicate very-young greyhound bitches
    Half-yawning at the open, inexperienced
    Vista of day,
    Folding back their soundless petalled ears.

    Greyhound bitches
    Sending their rosy muzzled pensive down,
    And breathing soft, unwilling to wake to the new day
    Yet sub-delighted.

    Ah Mediterranean morning, when our world began!
    Far-off Mediterranean mornings,
    Pelasgic faces uncovered,
    And unbudding cyclamens.

    The hare suddenly goes uphill
    Laying back her long ears with unwinking bliss.

    And up the pallid, sea-blenched Mediterranean stone-slopes
    Rose cyclamen, ecstatic fore-runner!
    Cyclamens, ruddy-muzzled cyclamens
    In little bunches like bunches of wild hares
    Muzzles together, ears-aprick
    Whispering witchcraft
    Like women at a well, the dawn-fountain.

    Greece, and the world's morning
    Where all the Parthenon marbles still fostered the roots of the cyclamen.
    Violets
    Pagan, rosy-muzzled violets
    Autumnal
    Dawn-pink,
    Dawn-pale
    Among squat toad-leaves sprinkling the unborn

HIBISCUS AND SALVIA FLOWERS


    _Hark! Hark!_
    _The dogs do bark!_
    _It's the socialists come to town,_
    _None in rags and none in tags,_
    _Swaggering up and down._

    Sunday morning,
    And from the Sicilian townlets skirting Etna
    The socialists have gathered upon us, to look at us.

    How shall we know them when we see them?
    How shall we know them now they've come?

    Not by their rags and not by their tags,
    Nor by any distinctive gown;
    The same unremarkable Sunday suit
    And hats cocked up and down.

    Yet there they are, youths, loutishly
    Strolling in gangs and staring along the Corso
    With the gang-stare
    And a half-threatening envy
    At every _foresti re_,
    Every lordly tuppenny foreigner from the hotels, fattening on the exchange.

    _Hark! Hark!_
    _The dogs do bark!_
    _It's the socialists in the town._

    Sans rags, sans tags,
    Sans beards, sans bags,
    Sans any distinction at all except loutish commonness.

    How do we know then, that they are they?
    Bolshevists.
    Leninists.
    Communists.
    Socialists.
-Ists!-Ists!

    Alas, salvia and hibiscus flowers.
    Salvia and hibiscus flowers.

    Listen again.
    Salvia and hibiscus flowers.
    Is it not so?
    Salvia and hibiscus flowers.

    _Hark! Hark!_
    _The dogs do bark!_
    Salvia and hibiscus flowers.

    Who smeared their doors with blood?
    Who on their breasts
    Put salvias and hibiscus?

    Rosy, rosy scarlet,
    And flame-rage, golden-throated
    Bloom along the Corso on the living, perambulating bush.

    Who said they might assume these blossoms?
    What god did they consult?

    Rose-red, princess hibiscus, rolling her pointed Chinese petals!
    Azalea and camellia, single peony
    And pomegranate bloom and scarlet mallow-flower
    And all the eastern, exquisite royal plants
    That noble blood has brought us down the ages!
    Gently nurtured, frail and splendid
    Hibiscus flower -- 
    Alas, the Sunday coats of Sicilian bolshevists!

    Pure blood, and noble blood, in the fine and rose-red veins;
    Small, interspersed with jewels of white gold
    Frail-filigreed among the rest;
    Rose of the oldest races of princesses, Polynesian
    Hibiscus.

    Eve, in her happy moments,
    Put hibiscus in her hair,
    Before she humbled herself, and knocked her knees with repentance.

    Sicilian bolshevists,
    With hibiscus flowers in the buttonholes of your Sunday suits,
    Come now, speaking of rights, what right have you to this flower?

    The exquisite and ageless aristocracy
    Of a peerless soul,
    Blessed are the pure in heart and the fathomless in bright pride;
    The loveliness that knows _noblesse oblige_;
    The native royalty of red hibiscus flowers;
    The exquisite assertion of new delicate life
    Risen from the roots:
    Is this how you'll have it, red-decked socialists,
    Hibiscus-breasted?

    If it be so, I fly to join you,
    And if it be not so, brutes to pull down hibiscus flowers!

    Or salvia!
    Or dragon-mouthed salvia with gold throat of wrath!
    Flame-flushed, enraged, splendid salvia,
    Cock-crested, crowing your orange scarlet like a tocsin
    Along the Corso all this Sunday morning.

    Is your wrath red as salvias,
    You socialists?
    You with your grudging, envious, furtive rage,
    In Sunday suits and yellow boots along the Corso.
    You look well with your salvia flowers, I must say.
    Warrior-like, dawn-cock's-comb flaring flower
    Shouting forth flame to set the world on fire,
    The dust-heap of man's filthy world on fire,
    And burn it down, the glutted, stuffy world,
    And feed the young new fields of life with ash,
    With ash I say,
    Bolshevists,
    Your ashes even, my friends,
    Among much other ash.

    If there were salvia-savage bolshevists
    To burn the world back to manure-good ash,
    Wouldn't I stick the salvia in my coat!
    But these themselves must burn, these louts!

    The dragon-faced,
    The anger-reddened, golden-throated salvia
    With its long antennae of rage put out
    Upon the frightened air.
    Ugh, how I love its fangs of perfect rage
    That gnash the air;
    The molten gold of its intolerable rage
    Hot in the throat.

    I long to be a bolshevist
    And set the stinking rubbish-heap of this foul world
    Afire at a myriad scarlet points,
    A bolshevist, a salvia-face
    To lick the world with flame that licks it clean.

    I long to see its chock-full crowdedness
    And glutted squirming populousness on fire
    Like a field of filthy weeds
    Burnt back to ash,
    And then to see the new, real souls sprout up.

    Not this vast rotting cabbage patch we call the world;
    But from the ash-scarred fallow
    New wild souls.

    Nettles, and a rose sprout,
    Hibiscus, and mere grass,
    Salvia still in a rage
    And almond honey-still,
    And fig-wort stinking for the carrion wasp;
    All the lot of them, and let them fight it out.

    But not a trace of foul equality,
    Nor sound of still more foul human perfection.
    You need not clear the world like a cabbage patch for me;
    Leave me my nettles,
    Let me fight the wicked, obstreperous weeds myself, and put them in their
        place,
    Severely in their place.
    I don't at all want to annihilate them,
    I like a row with them,
    But I won't be put on a cabbage-idealistic level of equality with them.

    What rot, to see the cabbage and hibiscus-tree
    As equals!
    What rot, to say the louts along the Corso
    In Sunday suits and yellow shoes
    Are my equals!
    I am their superior, saluting the hibiscus flower, not them.
    The same I say to the profiteers from the hotels, the money-fat-ones,
    Profiteers here being called dog-fish, stinking dog-fish, sharks.
    The same I say to the pale and elegant persons,
    Pale-face authorities loitering tepidly:
    _That I salute the red hibiscus flowers
    And send mankind to its inferior blazes._
    Mankind's inferior blazes,
    And these along with it, all the inferior lot -- 
    These bolshevists,
    These dog-fish,
    These precious and ideal ones,
    All rubbish ready for fire.
    And I salute hibiscus and the salvia flower
    Upon the breasts of loutish bolshevists,
    Damned loutish bolshevists,
    Who perhaps will do the business after all,
    In the long run, in spite of themselves.

    Meanwhile, alas
    For me no fellow-men,
    No salvia-frenzied comrades, antennae
    Of yellow-red, outreaching, living wrath
    Upon the smouldering air,
    And throat of brimstone-molten angry gold.
    Red, angry men are a race extinct, alas!

    Never
    To be a bolshevist
    With a hibiscus flower behind my ear
    In sign of life, of lovely, dangerous life
    And passionate disqualify of men;
    In sign of dauntless, silent violets,
    And impudent nettles grabbing the under-earth,
    And cabbages born to be cut and eat,
    And salvia fierce to crow and shout for fight,
    And rosy-red hibiscus wincingly
    Unfolding all her coiled and lovely self
    In a doubtful world.

    Never, bolshevistically
    To be able to stand for all these!
    Alas, alas, I have got to leave it all
    To the youths in Sunday suits and yellow shoes
    Who have pulled down the salvia flowers
    And rosy delicate hibiscus flowers
    And everything else to their disgusting level,
    Never, of course, to put anything up again.

    But yet
    If they pull all the world down,
    The process will amount to the same in the end.
    Instead of flame and flame-clean ash
    Slow watery rotting back to level muck
    And final humus,
    Whence the re-start.

    And still I cannot bear it
    That they take hibiscus and the salvia flower.




THE EVANGELISTIC BEASTS




ST MATTHEW


    They are not all beasts.
    One is a man, for example, and one is a bird.

    I, Matthew, am a man.

    And I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto me -- 

    That is Jesus.
    But then Jesus was not quite a man.
    He was the Son of Man
    Filius Meus, O remorseless logic
    Out of His own mouth.

    I, Matthew, being a man
    Cannot be lifted up, the Paraclete
    To draw all men unto me,
    Seeing I am on a par with all men.

    I, on the other hand,
    Am drawn to the Uplifted, as all men are drawn,
    To the Son of Man
    _Filius Meus_.

    _Wilt thou lift me up, Son of Man?_
    How my heart beats!
    I am man.

    I am man, and therefore my heart beats, and throws the dark blood from side
        to side
    All the time I am lifted up.
    Yes, even during my uplifting.

    And if it ceased?
    If it ceased, I should be no longer man
    As I am, if my heart in uplifting ceased to beat, to toss the dark
        blood from side to side, causing my myriad secret streams.

    After the cessation
    I might be a soul in bliss, an angel, approximating to the Uplifted;
    But that is another matter;
    I am Matthew, the man,
    And I am not that other angelic matter.

    So I will be lifted up, Saviour,
    But put me down again in time, Master,
    Before my heart stops beating, and I become what I am not.
    Put me down again on the earth, Jesus, on the brown soil
    Where flowers sprout in the acrid humus, and fade into humus again.
    Where beasts drop their unlicked young, and pasture, and drop
         their droppings among the turf.
    Where the adder darts horizontal.
    Down on the damp, unceasing ground, where my feet belong
    And even my heart, Lord, forever, after all uplifting:
    The crumbling, damp, fresh land, life horizontal and ceaseless.

    Matthew I am, the man.
    And I take the wings of the morning, to Thee, Crucified, Glorified.
    But while flowers club their petals at evening
    And rabbits make pills among the short grass
    And long snakes quickly glide into the dark hole in the wall, hearing man
        approach,
    I must be put down, Lord, in the afternoon,
    And at evening I must leave off my wings of the spirit
    As I leave off my braces
    And I must resume my nakedness like a fish, sinking down the dark reversion
        of night
    Like a fish seeking the bottom, Jesus,
         
    Face downwards
    Veering slowly
    Down between the steep slopes of darkness, fucus-dark, seaweed-fringed
         valleys of the waters under the sea
    Over the edge of the soundless cataract
    Into the fathomless, bottomless pit
    Where my soul falls in the last throes of bottomless convulsion, and is
       fallen
    Utterly beyond Thee, Dove of the Spirit;
    Beyond everything, except itself.

    Nay, Son of Man, I have been lifted up.
    To Thee I rose like a rocket ending in mid-heaven.
    But even Thou, Son of Man, canst not quaff out the dregs of terrestrial
       manhood!
    They fall back from Thee.

    They fall back, and like a dripping of quicksilver taking the downward track,
    Break into drops, burn into drops of blood, and dropping, dropping take
       wing
    Membraned, blood-veined wings.
    On fans of unsuspected tissue, like bats
    They thread and thrill and flicker ever downward
    To the dark zenith of Thine antipodes
    Jesus Uplifted.

    Bat-winged heart of man
    Reversed flame
    Shuddering a strange way down the bottomless pit
    To the great depths of its revers d zenith.

    Afterwards, afterwards
    Morning comes, and I shake the dews of night from the wings of my spirit
    And mount like a lark, Beloved.

    But remember, Saviour,
    That my heart which like a lark at heaven's gate singing, hovers
         morning-bright to Thee,
    Throws still the dark blood back and forth
    In the avenues where the bat hangs sleeping, upside-down
    And to me undeniable, Jesus.

    Listen, Paraclete.
    I can no more deny the bat-wings of my fathom-flickering spirit of darkness
    Than the wings of the Morning and Thee, Thou Glorified.

    I am Matthew, the Man:
    It is understood.
    And Thou art Jesus, Son of Man
    Drawing all men unto Thee, but bound to release them when the hour strikes.

    I have been, and I have returned.
    I have mounted up on the wings of the morning, and I have dredged down to
        the zenith's reversal.
    Which is my way, being man.
    Gods may stay in mid-heaven, the Son of Man has climbed to the Whitsun zenith,
    But I, Matthew, being a man
    Am a traveller back and forth.
    So be it.




ST MARK


    There was a lion in Judah
    Which whelped, and was Mark.

    But winged.
    A lion with wings.
    At least at Venice.
    Even as late as Daniele Manin.

    Why should he have wings?
    Is he to be a bird also?
    Or a spirit?
    Or a winged thought?
    Or a soaring consciousness?

    Evidently he is all that
    The lion of the spirit.

    Ah, Lamb of God
    Would a wingless lion lie down before Thee, as this winged lion lies?

    The lion of the spirit.

    Once he lay in the mouth of a cave
    And sunned his whiskers,
    And lashed his tail slowly, slowly
    Thinking of voluptuousness
    Even of blood.

    But later, in the sun of the afternoon
    Having tasted all there was to taste, and having slept his fill
    He fell to frowning, as he lay with his head on his paws
    And the sun coming in through the narrowest fibril of a slit in his eyes.

    So, nine-tenths asleep, motionless, bored, and statically angry,
    He saw in a shaft of light a lamb on a pinnacle, balancing a flag
        on its paw,
    And he was thoroughly startled.

    Going out to investigate
    He found the lamb beyond him, on the inaccessible pinnacle of light.
    So he put his paw to his nose, and pondered.

    Guard my sheep, came the silvery voice from the pinnacle,
    And I will give thee the wings of the morning.
    So the lion of the senses thought it was worth it.

    Hence he became a curly sheep-dog with dangerous propensities
    As Carpaccio will tell you:
    Ramping round, guarding the flock of mankind,
    Sharpening his teeth on the wolves,
    Ramping up through the air like a kestrel
    And lashing his tail above the world
    And enjoying the sensation of heaven and righteousness and voluptuous wrath.

    There is a new sweetness in his voluptuously licking his paw
    Now that it is a weapon of heaven.
    There is a new ecstasy in his roar of desirous love
    Now that it sounds self-conscious through the unlimited sky.
    He is well aware of himself
    And he cherishes voluptuous delights, and thinks about them
    And ceases to be a blood-thirsty king of beasts
    And becomes the faithful sheep-dog of the Shepherd, thinking of
         his voluptuous pleasures of chasing the sheep to the fold
    And increasing the flock, and perhaps giving a real nip here and there,
       a real pinch, but always well meant.

    And somewhere there is a lioness
    The she-mate.
    Whelps play between the paws of the lion
    The she-mate purrs
    Their castle is impregnable, their cave,
    The sun comes in their lair, they are well-off
    A well-to-do family.

    Then the proud lion stalks abroad, alone
    And roars to announce himself to the wolves
    And also to encourage the red-cross Lamb
    And also to ensure a goodly increase in the world.

    Look at him, with his paw on the world
    At Venice and elsewhere.
    Going blind at last.




ST LUKE


    A wall, a bastion,
    A living forehead with its slow whorl of hair
    And a bull's large, sombre, glancing eye
    And glistening, adhesive muzzle
    With cavernous nostrils where the winds run hot
    Snorting defiance
    Or greedily snuffling behind the cows.

    Horns
    The golden horns of power,
    Power to kill, power to create
    Such as Moses had, and God,
    Head-power.

    Shall great wings flame from his shoulder-sockets
    Assyrian-wise?
    It would be no wonder.

    Knowing the thunder of his heart
    The massive thunder of his dew-lapped chest
    Deep and reverberating,
    It would be no wonder if great wings, like flame, fanned out from
         the furnace-cracks of his shoulder-sockets.

    Thud! Thud! Thud!
    And the roar of black bull's blood in the mighty passages of his chest.

    Ah, the dewlap swings pendulous with excess.
    The great, roaring weight above
    Like a furnace dripping a molten drip.

    The urge, the massive, burning ache
    Of the bull's breast.
    The open furnace-doors of his nostrils.

    For what does he ache, and groan?

    In his breast a wall?

    Nay, once it was also a fortress wall, and the weight of a vast battery.
    But now it is a burning hearthstone only,
    Massive old altar of his own burnt offering.

    It was always an altar of burnt offering
    His own black blood poured out like a sheet of flame over his fecundating
        herd
    As he gave himself forth.

    But also it was a fiery fortress frowning shaggily on the world
    And announcing battle ready.

    Since the Lamb bewitched him with that red-struck flag
    His fortress is dismantled
    His fires of wrath are banked down
    His horns turn away from the enemy.

    He serves the Son of Man.

    And hear him bellow, after many years, the bull that serves the Son of Man.
    Moaning, booing, roaring hollow
    Constrained to pour forth all his fire down the narrow sluice of procreation
    Through such narrow loins, too narrow.

    Is he not over-charged by the dammed-up pressure of his own massive black
        blood
    Luke, the Bull, the father of substance, the Providence Bull, after two
       thousand years?
    Is he not over-full of offering, a vast, vast offer of himself
    Which must be poured through so small a vent?

    Too small a vent.

    Let him remember his horns, then.
    Seal up his forehead once more to a bastion,
    Let it know nothing.
    Let him charge like a mighty catapult on the red-cross flag, let him roar
        out challenge on the world
    And throwing himself upon it, throw off the madness of his blood.
    Let it be war.

    And so it is war.
    The bull of the proletariat has got his head down.




ST JOHN


    John, oh John,
    Thou honourable bird
    Sun-peering eagle.

    Taking a bird's-eye view
    Even of Calvary and Resurrection
    Not to speak of Babylon's whoredom.

    High over the mild effulgence of the dove
    Hung all the time, did we but know it, the all-knowing shadow
    Of John's great gold-barred eagle.

    John knew all about it
    Even the very beginning.

    In the beginning was the Word
    And the Word was God
    And the Word was with God.

    Having been to school
    John knew the whole proposition.
    As for innocent Jesus
    He was one of Nature's phenomena, no doubt.

    Oh that mind-soaring eagle of an Evangelist
    Staring creation out of countenance
    And telling it off
    As an eagle staring down on the Sun!

    The Logos, the Logos!
    In the beginning was the Word.

    Is there not a great Mind pre-ordaining?
    Does not a supreme Intellect ideally procreate the Universe?
    Is not each soul a vivid thought in the great consciousness stream of God?

    Put salt on his tail
    The sly bird of John.

    Proud intellect, high-soaring Mind
    Like a king eagle, bird of the most High, sweeping the round of heaven
    And casting the cycles of creation
    On two wings, like a pair of compasses;
    Jesus' pale and lambent dove, cooing in the lower boughs
    On sufferance.

    In the beginning was the Word, of course.
    And the word was the first offspring of the almighty Johannine mind,
    Chick of the intellectual eagle.

    Yet put salt on the tail of the Johannine bird
    Put salt on its tail
    John's eagle.

    Shoo it down out of the empyrean
    Of the all-seeing, all-fore-ordaining ideal.
    Make it roost on bird-spattered, rocky Patmos
    And let it moult there, among the stones of the bitter sea.

    For the almighty eagle of the fore-ordaining Mind
    Is looking rather shabby and island-bound these days:
    Moulting, and rather naked about the rump, and down in the beak,
    Rather dirty, on dung-whitened Patmos.

    From which we are led to assume
    That the old bird is weary, and almost willing
    That a new chick should chip the extensive shell
    Of the mundane egg.

    The poor old golden eagle of the creative spirit
    Moulting and moping and waiting, willing at last
    For the fire to burn it up, feathers and all
    So that a new conception of the beginning and end
    Can rise from the ashes.

    Ah Phoenix, Phoenix
    John's Eagle!
    You are only known to us now as the badge of an insurance Company.

    Phoenix, Phoenix
    The nest is in flames
    Feathers are singeing,
    Ash flutters flocculent, like down on a blue, wan fledgeling.




CREATURES




THE MOSQUITO


    When did you start your tricks
    Monsieur?

    What do you stand on such high legs for?
    Why this length of shredded shank
    You exaltation?

    Is it so that you shall lift your centre of gravity upwards
    And weigh no more than air as you alight upon me,
    Stand upon me weightless, you phantom?

    I heard a woman call you the Winged Victory
    In sluggish Venice.
    You turn your head towards your tail, and smile.

    How can you put so much devilry
    Into that translucent phantom shred
    Of a frail corpus?

    Queer, with your thin wings and your streaming legs
    How you sail like a heron, or a dull clot of air,
    A nothingness.

    Yet what an aura surrounds you;
    Your evil little aura, prowling, and casting a numbness on my mind.

    That is your trick, your bit of filthy magic:
    Invisibility, and the anaesthetic power
    To deaden my attention in your direction.

    But I know your game now, streaky sorcerer.

    Queer, how you stalk and prowl the air
    In circles and evasions, enveloping me,
    Ghoul on wings
    Winged Victory.

    Settle, and stand on long thin shanks
    Eyeing me sideways, and cunningly conscious that I am aware,
    You speck.

    I hate the way you lurch off sideways into air
    Having read my thoughts against you.

    Come then, let us play at unawares,
    And see who wins in this sly game of bluff.
    Man or mosquito.

    You don't know that I exist, and I don't know that you exist.
    Now then!

    It is your trump
    It is your hateful little trump
    You pointed fiend,
    Which shakes my sudden blood to hatred of you:
    It is your small, high, hateful bugle in my ear.

    Why do you do it?
    Surely it is bad policy.

    They say you can't help it.

    If that is so, then I believe a little in Providence protecting the innocent.
    But it sounds so amazingly like a slogan
    A yell of triumph as you snatch my scalp.

    Blood, red blood
    Super-magical
    Forbidden liquor.

    I behold you stand
    For a second enspasmed in oblivion,
    Obscenely ecstasied
    Sucking live blood
    My blood.

    Such silence, such suspended transport,
    Such gorging,
    Such obscenity of trespass.

    You stagger
    As well as you may.
    Only your accursed hairy frailty
    Your own imponderable weightlessness
    Saves you, wafts you away on the very draught my anger makes in its snatching.

    Away with a paean of derision
    You winged blood-drop.

    Can I not overtake you?
    Are you one too many for me
    Winged Victory?
    Am I not mosquito enough to out-mosquito you?

    Queer, what a big stain my sucked blood makes
    Beside the infinitesimal faint smear of you!
    Queer, what a dim dark smudge you have disappeared into!




FISH


    Fish, oh Fish,
    So little matters!

    Whether the waters rise and cover the earth
    Or whether the waters wilt in the hollow places,
    All one to you.

    Aqueous, subaqueous,
    Submerged
    And wave-thrilled.

    As the waters roll
    Roll you.
    The waters wash,
    You wash in oneness
    And never emerge.

    Never know,
    Never grasp.

    Your life a sluice of sensation along your sides,
    A flush at the flails of your fins, down the whorl of your tail,
    And water wetly on fire in the grates of your gills;
    Fixed water-eyes.

    Even snakes lie together.

    But oh, fish, that rock in water,
    You lie only with the waters;
    One touch.

    No fingers, no hands and feet, no lips;
    No tender muzzles,
    No wistful bellies,
    No loins of desire,
    None.

    You and the naked element,
    Sway-wave.
    Curvetting bits of tin in the evening light.

    Who is it ejects his sperm to the naked flood?
    In the wave-mother?
    Who swims enwombed?
    Who lies with the waters of his silent passion, womb-element?
   -- Fish in the waters under the earth.

    What price _his_ bread upon the waters?

    Himself all silvery himself
    In the element
    No more.

    Nothing more.

    Himself,
    And the element.
    Food, of course!
    Water-eager eyes,
    Mouth-gate open
    And strong spine urging, driving;
    And desirous belly gulping.

    Fear also!
    He knows fear!
    Water-eyes craning,
    A rush that almost screams,
    Almost fish-voice
    As the pike comes....
    Then gay fear, that turns the tail sprightly, from a shadow.

    Food, and fear, and joie de vivre,
    Without love.

    The other way about:
    Joie de vivre, and fear, and food,
    All without love.

    Quelle joie de vivre
    Dans l'eau!
    Slowly to gape through the waters,
    Alone with the element;
    To sink, and rise, and go to sleep with the waters;
    To speak endless inaudible wavelets into the wave;
    To breathe from the flood at the gills,
    Fish-blood slowly running next to the flood, extracting fish-fire;
    To have the element under one, like a lover;
    And to spring away with a curvetting click in the air,
    Provocative.
    Dropping back with a slap on the face of the flood.
    And merging oneself!

    To be a fish!

    So utterly without misgiving
    To be a fish
    In the waters.

    Loveless, and so lively!
    Born before God was love,
    Or life knew loving.
    Beautifully beforehand with it all.

    Admitted, they swarm in companies,
    Fishes.
    They drive in shoals.
    But soundless, and out of contact.
    They exchange no word, no spasm, not even anger.
    Not one touch.
    Many suspended together, forever apart,
    Each one alone with the waters, upon one wave with the rest.

    A magnetism in the water between them only.

    I saw a water-serpent swim across the Anapo,
    And I said to my heart, _look, look at him!_
    _With his head up, steering like a bird!_
    _He's a rare one, but he belongs ..._

    But sitting in a boat on the Zeller lake
    And watching the fishes in the breathing waters
    Lift and swim and go their way -- 

    I said to my heart, _who are these?_
    And my heart couldn't own them....

    A slim young pike, with smart fins
    And grey-striped suit, a young cub of a pike
    Slouching along away below, half out of sight,
    Like a lout on an obscure pavement....

    Aha, there's somebody in the know!

    But watching closer
    That motionless deadly motion,
    That unnatural barrel body, that long ghoul nose, ...
    I left off hailing him.

    I had made a mistake, I didn't know him,
    This grey, monotonous soul in the water,
    This intense individual in shadow,
    Fish-alive.

    I didn't know his God,
    I didn't know his God.

    Which is perhaps the last admission that life has to wring out of us.

    I saw, dimly,
    Once a big pike rush,
    And small fish fly like splinters.
    And I said to my heart, _there are limits_
    _To you, my heart;_
    _And to the one God._
    _Fish are beyond me._

    Other Gods
    Beyond my range ... gods beyond my God ...

    They are beyond me, are fishes.
    I stand at the pale of my being
    And look beyond, and see
    Fish, in the outerwards,
    As one stands on a bank and looks in.

    I have waited with a long rod
    And suddenly pulled a gold-and-greenish, lucent fish from below,
    And had him fly like a halo round my head,
    Lunging in the air on the line.

    Unhooked his gorping, water-horny mouth,
    And seen his horror-tilted eye,
    His red-gold, water-precious, mirror-flat bright eye;
    And felt him beat in my hand, with his mucous, leaping life-throb.

    And my heart accused itself
    Thinking: _I am not the measure of creation._
    _This is beyond me, this fish._
    _His God stands outside my God._

    And the gold-and-green pure lacquer-mucus comes off in my hand,
    And the red-gold mirror-eye stares and dies,
    And the water-suave contour dims.

    But not before I have had to know
    He was born in front of my sunrise,
    Before my day.

    He outstarts me.
    And I, a many-fingered horror of daylight to him,
    Have made him die.

    Fishes,
    With their gold, red eyes, and green-pure gleam, and under-gold,
    And their pre-world loneliness,
    And more-than-lovelessness,
    And white meat;
    They move in other circles.

    Outsiders.
    Water-wayfarers.
    Things of one element.
    Aqueous,
    Each by itself.

    Cats, and the Neapolitans,
    Sulphur sun-beasts,
    Thirst for fish as for more-than-water;
    Water-alive
    To quench their over-sulphureous lusts.

    But I, I only wonder
    And don't know.
    I don't know fishes.

    In the beginning
    Jesus was called The Fish....
    And in the end.




BAT


    At evening, sitting on this terrace,
    When the sun from the west, beyond Pisa, beyond the mountains of Carrara
    Departs, and the world is taken by surprise ...

    When the tired flower of Florence is in gloom beneath the glowing
    Brown hills surrounding ...

    When under the arches of the Ponte Vecchio
    A green light enters against stream, flush from the west,
    Against the current of obscure Arno ...

    Look up, and you see things flying
    Between the day and the night;
    Swallows with spools of dark thread sewing the shadows together.

    A circle swoop, and a quick parabola under the bridge arches
    Where light pushes through;
    A sudden turning upon itself of a thing in the air.
    A dip to the water.

    And you think:
    The swallows are flying so late!

    Swallows?

    Dark air-life looping
    Yet missing the pure loop ...
    A twitch, a twitter, an elastic shudder in flight
    And serrated wings against the sky,
    Like a glove, a black glove thrown up at the light,
    And falling back.

    Never swallows!
    _Bats!_
    The swallows are gone.

    At a wavering instant the swallows gave way to bats
    By the Ponte Vecchio ...
    Changing guard.

    Bats, and an uneasy creeping in one's scalp
    As the bats swoop overhead!
    Flying madly.

    Pipistrello!
    Black piper on an infinitesimal pipe.
    Little lumps that fly in air and have voices indefinite, wildly vindictive;

    Wings like bits of umbrella.

    Bats!

    Creatures that hang themselves up like an old rag, to sleep;
    And disgustingly upside down.

    Hanging upside down like rows of disgusting old rags
    And grinning in their sleep.
    Bats!

    Not for me!




MAN AND BAT


    When I went into my room, at mid-morning,
    Say ten o'clock ...
    My room, a crash-box over that great stone rattle
    The Via de' Bardi....

    When I went into my room at mid-morning
    _Why?... a bird!_

    A bird
    Flying round the room in insane circles.

    In insane circles!
    _ ... A bat!_

    A disgusting bat
    At mid-morning!...

    _Out! Go out!_

    Round and round and round
    With a twitchy, nervous, intolerable flight,
    And a neurasthenic lunge,
    And an impure frenzy;
    A bat, big as a swallow.

    _Out, out of my room!_

    The Venetian shutters I push wide
    To the free, calm upper air;
    Loop back the curtains....

    _Now out, out from my room!_

    So to drive him out, flicking with my white handkerchief: _Go!_
    But he will not.

    Round and round and round
    In an impure haste,
    Fumbling, a beast in air,
    And stumbling, lunging and touching the walls, the bell-wires
    About my room!

    Always refusing to go out into the air
    Above that crash-gulf of the Via de' Bardi,
    Yet blind with frenzy, with cluttered fear.

    At last he swerved into the window bay,
    But blew back, as if an incoming wind blew him in again.
    A strong inrushing wind.

    And round and round and round!
    Blundering more insane, and leaping, in throbs, to clutch at a corner,
    At a wire, at a bell-rope:
    On and on, watched relentless by me, round and round in my room,
    Round and round and dithering with tiredness and haste and increasing delirium
    Flicker-splashing round my room.

    I would not let him rest;
    Not one instant cleave, cling like a blot with his breast to the wall
    In an obscure corner.
    Not an instant!

    I flicked him on,
    Trying to drive him through the window.

    Again he swerved into the window bay
    And I ran forward, to frighten him forth.
    But he rose, and from a terror worse than me he flew past me
    Back into my room, and round, round, round in my room
    Clutch, cleave, stagger,
    Dropping about the air
    Getting tired.

    Something seemed to blow him back from the window
    Every time he swerved at it;
    Back on a strange parabola, then round, round, dizzy in my room.

    He _could_ not go out,
    I also realised....
    It was the light of day which he could not enter,
    Any more than I could enter the white-hot door of a blast-furnace.

    He could not plunge into the daylight that streamed at the window.
    It was asking too much of his nature.

    Worse even than the hideous terror of me with my handkerchief
    Saying: _Out, go out!..._
    Was the horror of white daylight in the window!

    So I switched on the electric light, thinking: _Now_
    _The outside will seem brown...._

    But no.
    The outside did not seem brown.
    And he did not mind the yellow electric light.

    Silent!
    He was having a silent rest.
    _But never!_
    _Not in my room._

    Round and round and round
    Near the ceiling as if in a web,
    Staggering;
    Plunging, falling out of the web,
    Broken in heaviness,
    Lunging blindly,
    Heavier;
    And clutching, clutching for one second's pause,
    Always, as if for one drop of rest,
    One little drop.

    And I!
    _Never_, I say....
    _Go out!_

    Flying slower,
    Seeming to stumble, to fall in air.
    Blind-weary.

    Yet never able to pass the whiteness of light into freedom ...
    A bird would have dashed through, come what might.

    Fall, sink, lurch, and round and round
    Flicker, flicker-heavy;
    Even wings heavy:
    And cleave in a high corner for a second, like a clot, also a prayer.

    _But no._
    _Out, you beast._

    Till he fell in a corner, palpitating, spent.
    And there, a clot, he squatted and looked at me.
    With sticking-out, bead-berry eyes, black,
    And improper derisive ears,
    And shut wings,
    And brown, furry body.

    Brown, nut-brown, fine fur!
    But it might as well have been hair on a spider; thing
    With long, black-paper ears.

    So, a dilemma!
    He squatted there like something unclean.

    No, he must not squat, nor hang, obscene, in my room!

    Yet nothing on earth will give him courage to pass the sweet fire of day.

    What then?
    Hit him and kill him and throw him away?

    Nay,
    I didn't create him.
    Let the God that created him be responsible for his death ...
    Only, in the bright day, I will not have this clot in my room.

    Let the God who is maker of bats watch with them in their unclean corners....
    I admit a God in every crevice,
    But not bats in my room;
    Nor the God of bats, while the sun shines.

    _So out, out you brute!..._
    And he lunged, flight-heavy, away from me, sideways, _a sghembo_!
    And round and round and round my room, a clot with wings,
    Impure even in weariness.

    Wings dark skinny and flapping the air,
    Lost their flicker.
    Spent.

    He fell again with a little thud
    Near the curtain on the floor.
    And there lay.

    Ah death, death
    You are no solution!
    Bats must be bats.

    Only life has a way out.
    And the human soul is fated to wide-eyed responsibility
    In life.

    So I picked him up in a flannel jacket,
    Well covered, lest he should bite me.
    For I would have had to kill him if he'd bitten me, the impure one....
    And he hardly stirred in my hand, muffled up.

    Hastily, I shook him out of the window.

    And away he went!
    Fear craven in his tail.
    Great haste, and straight, almost bird straight above the Via de' Bardi.
    Above that crash-gulf of exploding whips,
    Towards the Borgo San Jacopo.

    And now, at evening, as he flickers over the river
    Dipping with petty triumphant flight, and tittering over the sun's departure,
    I believe he chirps, pipistrello, seeing me here on this terrace writing:
    _There he sits, the long loud one!_
    _But I am greater than he ..._
    _I escaped him...._




REPTILES




SNAKE


    A snake came to my water-trough
    On a hot, hot day, and I in pyjamas for the heat,
    To drink there.

    In the deep, strange-scented shade of the great dark carob-tree
    I came down the steps with my pitcher
    And must wait, must stand and wait, for there he was at the trough before
        me.

    He reached down from a fissure in the earth-wall in the gloom
    And trailed his yellow-brown slackness soft-bellied down, over the edge
       of the stone trough
    And rested his throat upon the stone bottom,
    And where the water had dripped from the tap, in a small clearness,
    He sipped with his straight mouth,
    Softly drank through his straight gums, into his slack long body,
    Silently.

    Someone was before me at my water-trough,
    And I, like a second comer, waiting.

    He lifted his head from his drinking, as cattle do,
    And looked at me vaguely, as drinking cattle do,
    And flickered his two-forked tongue from his lips, and mused a moment,
    And stooped and drank a little more,
    Being earth-brown, earth-golden from the burning bowels of the earth
    On the day of Sicilian July, with Etna smoking.

    The voice of my education said to me
    He must be killed,
    For in Sicily the black, black snakes are innocent, the gold are venomous.

    And voices in me said, If you were a man
    You would take a stick and break him now, and finish him off.

    But must I confess how I liked him,
    How glad I was he had come like a guest in quiet, to drink at my water-trough
    And depart peaceful, pacified, and thankless,
    Into the burning bowels of this earth?

    Was it cowardice, that I dared not kill him?
    Was it perversity, that I longed to talk to him?
    Was it humility, to feel so honoured?
    I felt so honoured.

    And yet those voices:
    _If you were not afraid, you would kill him!_

    And truly I was afraid, I was most afraid,
    But even so, honoured still more
    That he should seek my hospitality
    From out the dark door of the secret earth.

    He drank enough
    And lifted his head, dreamily, as one who has drunken,
    And dickered his tongue like a forked night on the air, so black,
    Seeming to lick his lips,
    And looked around like a god, unseeing, into the air,
    And slowly turned his head,
    And slowly, very slowly, as if thrice adream,
    Proceeded to draw his slow length curving round
    And climb again the broken bank of my wall-face.

    And as he put his head into that dreadful hole,
    And as he slowly drew up, snake-easing his shoulders, and entered farther,
    A sort of horror, a sort of protest against his withdrawing into that
         horrid black hole,
    Deliberately going into the blackness, and slowly drawing himself after,
    Overcame me now his back was turned.

    I looked round, I put down my pitcher,
    I picked up a clumsy log
    And threw it at the water-trough with a clatter.

    I think it did not hit him,
    But suddenly that part of him that was left behind convulsed in undignified
        haste,
    Writhed like lightning, and was gone
    Into the black hole, the earth-lipped fissure in the wall-front,
    At which, in the intense still noon, I stared with fascination.

    And immediately I regretted it.
    I thought how paltry, how vulgar, what a mean act!
    I despised myself and the voices of my accursed human education.

    And I thought of the albatross,
    And I wished he would come back, my snake.

    For he seemed to me again like a king,
    Like a king in exile, uncrowned in the underworld,
    Now due to be crowned again.

    And so, I missed my chance with one of the lords
    Of life.
    And I have something to expiate;
    A pettiness.





BABY TORTOISE


    You know what it is to be born alone,
    Baby tortoise!

    The first day to heave your feet little by little from the shell,
    Not yet awake,
    And remain lapsed on earth,
    Not quite alive.

    A tiny, fragile, half-animate bean.

    To open your tiny beak-mouth, that looks as if it would never open,
    Like some iron door;
    To lift the upper hawk-beak from the lower base
    And reach your skinny little neck
    And take your first bite at some dim bit of herbage,
    Alone, small insect,
    Tiny bright-eye,
    Slow one.

    To take your first solitary bite
    And move on your slow, solitary hunt.
    Your bright, dark little eye,
    Your eye of a dark disturbed night,
    Under its slow lid, tiny baby tortoise,
    So indomitable.

    No one ever heard you complain.

    You draw your head forward, slowly, from your little wimple
    And set forward, slow-dragging, on your four-pinned toes,
    Rowing slowly forward.
    Whither away, small bird?

    Rather like a baby working its limbs,
    Except that you make slow, ageless progress
    And a baby makes none.

    The touch of sun excites you,
    And the long ages, and the lingering chill
    Make you pause to yawn,
    Opening your impervious mouth,
    Suddenly beak-shaped, and very wide, like some suddenly gaping pincers;
    Soft red tongue, and hard thin gums,
    Then close the wedge of your little mountain front,
    Your face, baby tortoise.

    Do you wonder at the world, as slowly you turn your head in its wimple
    And look with laconic, black eyes?
    Or is sleep coming over you again,
    The non-life?

    You are so hard to wake.

    Are you able to wonder?
    Or is it just your indomitable will and pride of the first life
    Looking round
    And slowly pitching itself against the inertia
    Which had seemed invincible?

    The vast inanimate,
    And the fine brilliance of your so tiny eye,
    Challenger.

    Nay, tiny shell-bird,
    What a huge vast inanimate it is, that you must row against,
    What an incalculable inertia.

    Challenger,
    Little Ulysses, fore-runner,
    No bigger than my thumb-nail,
    Buon viaggio.

    All animate creation on your shoulder,
    Set forth, little Titan, under your battle-shield.

    The ponderous, preponderate,
    Inanimate universe;
    And you are slowly moving, pioneer, you alone.

    How vivid your travelling seems now, in the troubled sunshine,
    Stoic, Ulyssean atom;
    Suddenly hasty, reckless, on high toes.

    Voiceless little bird,
    Resting your head half out of your wimple
    In the slow dignity of your eternal pause.
    Alone, with no sense of being alone,
    And hence six times more solitary;
    Fulfilled of the slow passion of pitching through immemorial ages
    Your little round house in the midst of chaos.

    Over the garden earth,
    Small bird,
    Over the edge of all things.

    Traveller,
    With your tail tucked a little on one side
    Like a gentleman in a long-skirted coat.

    All life carried on your shoulder,
    Invincible fore-runner.




TORTOISE SHELL


    The Cross, the Cross
    Goes deeper in than we know,
    Deeper into life;
    Right into the marrow
    And through the bone.

    Along the back of the baby tortoise
    The scales are locked in an arch like a bridge,
    Scale-lapping, like a lobster's sections
    Or a bee's.

    Then crossways down his sides
    Tiger-stripes and wasp-bands.

    Five, and five again, and five again,
    And round the edges twenty-five little ones,
    The sections of the baby tortoise shell.

    Four, and a keystone;
    Four, and a keystone;
    Four, and a keystone;
    Then twenty-four, and a tiny little keystone.

    It needed Pythagoras to see life playing with counters on the living
         back
    Of the baby tortoise;
    Life establishing the first eternal mathematical tablet,
    Not in stone, like the Judean Lord, or bronze, but in life-clouded,
         life-rosy tortoise shell.

    The first little mathematical gentleman
    Stepping, wee mite, in his loose trousers
    Under all the eternal dome of mathematical law.

    Fives, and tens,
    Threes and fours and twelves,
    All the _volte face_ of decimals,
    The whirligig of dozens and the pinnacle of seven.

    Turn him on his back,
    The kicking little beetle,
    And there again, on his shell-tender, earth-touching belly,
    The long cleavage of division, upright of the eternal cross
    And on either side count five,
    On each side, two above, on each side, two below
    The dark bar horizontal.

    The Cross!
    It goes right through him, the sprottling insect,
    Through his cross-wise cloven psyche,
    Through his five-fold complex-nature.

    So turn him over on his toes again;
    Four pin-point toes, and a problematical thumb-piece,
    Four rowing limbs, and one wedge-balancing head,
    Four and one makes five, which is the clue to all mathematics.

    The Lord wrote it all down on the little slate
    Of the baby tortoise.
    Outward and visible indication of the plan within,
    The complex, manifold involvedness of an individual creature
    Plotted out
    On this small bird, this rudiment,
    This little dome, this pediment
    Of all creation,
    This slow one.




TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS


    On he goes, the little one,
    Bud of the universe,
    Pediment of life.

    Setting off somewhere, apparently.
    Whither away, brisk egg?

    His mother deposited him on the soil as if he were no more than droppings,
    And now he scuffles tinily past her as if she were an old rusty tin.

    A mere obstacle,
    He veers round the slow great mound of her -- 
    Tortoises always foresee obstacles.

    It is no use my saying to him in an emotional voice:
    This is your Mother, she laid you when you were an egg.

    He does not even trouble to answer: Woman, what have I to do with thee?
    He wearily looks the other way,
    And she even more wearily looks another way still,
    Each with the utmost apathy,
    Incognisant,
    Unaware,
    Nothing.

    As for papa,
    He snaps when I offer him his offspring,
    Just as he snaps when I poke a bit of stick at him,
    Because he is irascible this morning, an irascible tortoise
    Being touched with love, and devoid of fatherliness.

    Father and mother,
    And three little brothers,
    And all rambling aimless, like little perambulating pebbles
        scattered in the garden,
    Not knowing each other from bits of earth or old tins.

    Except that papa and mama are old acquaintances, of course,
    Though family feeling there is none, not even the beginnings.

    Fatherless, motherless, brotherless, sisterless
    Little tortoise.

    Row on then, small pebble,
    Over the clods of the autumn, wind-chilled sunshine,
    Young gaiety.

    Does he look for a companion?

    No, no, don't think it.
    He doesn't know he is alone;
    Isolation is his birthright,
    This atom.

    To row forward, and reach himself tall on spiny toes,
    To travel, to burrow into a little loose earth, afraid of the night,
    To crop a little substance,
    To move, and to be quite sure that he is moving:
    Basta!
    To be a tortoise!
    Think of it, in a garden of inert clods
    A brisk, brindled little tortoise, all to himself -- 
    Croesus!

    In a garden of pebbles and insects
    To roam, and feel the slow heart beat
    Tortoise-wise, the first bell sounding
    From the warm blood, in the dark-creation morning.

    Moving, and being himself,
    Slow, and unquestioned,
    And inordinately there, O stoic!
    Wandering in the slow triumph of his own existence,
    Ringing the soundless bell of his presence in chaos,
    And biting the frail grass arrogantly,
    Decidedly arrogantly.




LUI ET ELLE


    She is large and matronly
    And rather dirty,
    A little sardonic-looking, as if domesticity had driven her to it.

    Though what she does, except lay four eggs at random in the garden once
       a year
    And put up with her husband,
    I don't know.

    She likes to eat.
    She hurries up, striding reared on long uncanny legs,
    When food is going.
    Oh yes, she can make haste when she likes.

    She snaps the soft bread from my hand in great mouthfuls,
    Opening her rather pretty wedge of an iron, pristine face
    Into an enormously wide-beaked mouth
    Like sudden curved scissors,
    And gulping at more than she can swallow, and working her thick, soft tongue,
    And having the bread hanging over her chin.

    O Mistress, Mistress,
    Reptile mistress,
    Your eye is very dark, very bright,
    And it never softens
    Although you watch.

    She knows,
    She knows well enough to come for food,
    Yet she sees me not;
    Her bright eye sees, but not me, not anything,
    Sightful, sightless, seeing and visionless,
    Reptile mistress.

    Taking bread in her curved, gaping, toothless mouth,
    She has no qualm when she catches my finger in her steel overlapping gums,
    But she hangs on, and my shout and my shrinking are nothing to her.
    She does not even know she is nipping me with her curved beak.
    Snake-like she draws at my finger, while I drag it in horror away.

    Mistress, reptile mistress,
    You are almost too large, I am almost frightened.

    He is much smaller,
    Dapper beside her,
    And ridiculously small.

    Her laconic eye has an earthy, materialistic look,
    His, poor darling, is almost fiery.

    His wimple, his blunt-prowed face,
    His low forehead, his skinny neck, his long, scaled, striving legs,
    So striving, striving,
    Are all more delicate than she,
    And he has a cruel scar on his shell.

    Poor darling, biting at her feet,
    Running beside her like a dog, biting her earthy, splay feet,
    Nipping her ankles,
    Which she drags apathetic away, though without retreating into her shell.

    Agelessly silent,
    And with a grim, reptile determination,
    Cold, voiceless age-after-age behind him, serpents' long obstinacy
    Of horizontal persistence.

    Little old man
    Scuffling beside her, bending down, catching his opportunity,
    Parting his steel-trap face, so suddenly, and seizing her scaly ankle,
    And hanging grimly on,
    Letting go at last as she drags away,
    And closing his steel-trap face.

    His steel-trap, stoic, ageless, handsome face.
    Alas, what a fool he looks in this scuffle.

    And how he feels it!
    The lonely rambler, the stoic, dignified stalker through chaos,
    The immune, the animate,
    Enveloped in isolation,
    Forerunner.
    Now look at him!

    Alas, the spear is through the side of his isolation.
    His adolescence saw him crucified into sex,
    Doomed, in the long crucifixion of desire, to seek his consummation beyond
        himself.
    Divided into passionate duality,
    He, so finished and immune, now broken into desirous fragmentariness,
    Doomed to make an intolerable fool of himself
    In his effort toward completion again.

    Poor little earthy house-inhabiting Osiris,
    The mysterious bull tore him at adolescence into pieces,
    And he must struggle after reconstruction, ignominiously.

    And so behold him following the tail
    Of that mud-hovel of his slowly rambling spouse,
    Like some unhappy bull at the tail of a cow,
    But with more than bovine, grim, earth-dank persistence.

    Suddenly seizing the ugly ankle as she stretches out to walk,
    Roaming over the sods,
    Or, if it happen to show, at her pointed, heavy tail
    Beneath the low-dropping back-board of her shell.

    Their two shells like domed boats bumping,
    Hers huge, his small;
    Their splay feet rambling and rowing like paddles,
    And stumbling mixed up in one another,
    In the race of love -- 
    Two tortoises,
    She huge, he small.

    She seems earthily apathetic,
    And he has a reptile's awful persistence.

    I heard a woman pitying her, pitying the M re Tortue.
    While I, I pity Monsieur.
    He pesters her and torments her, said the woman.
    How much more is _he_ pestered and tormented, say I.

    What can he do?
    He is dumb, he is visionless,
    Conceptionless.
    His black, sad-lidded eye sees but beholds not
    As her earthen mound moves on,
    But he catches the folds of vulnerable, leathery skin,
    Nail-studded, that shake beneath her shell,
    And drags at these with his beak,
    Drags and drags and bites,
    While she pulls herself free, and rows her dull mound along.




TORTOISE GALLANTRY


    Making his advances
    He does not look at her, nor sniff at her,
    No, not even sniff at her, his nose is blank.

    Only he senses the vulnerable folds of skin
    That work beneath her while she sprawls along
    In her ungainly pace,
    Her folds of skin that work and row
    Beneath the earth-soiled hovel in which she moves.

    And so he strains beneath her housey walls
    And catches her trouser-legs in his beak
    Suddenly, or her skinny limb,
    And strange and grimly drags at her
    Like a dog,
    Only agelessly silent, with a reptile's awful persistency

    Grim, gruesome gallantry, to which he is doomed.
    Dragged out of an eternity of silent isolation
    And doomed to partiality, partial being,
    Ache, and want of being,
    Want,
    Self-exposure, hard humiliation, need to add himself on to her

    Born to walk alone,
    Fore-runner,
    Now suddenly distracted into this mazy side-track,
    This awkward, harrowing pursuit,
    This grim necessity from within.

    Does she know
    As she moves eternally slowly away?
    Or is he driven against her with a bang, like a bird flying in the dark
       against a window,
    All knowledgeless?

    The awful concussion,
    And the still more awful need to persist, to follow, follow, continue,

    Driven, after aeons of pristine, fore-god-like singleness and oneness,
    At the end of some mysterious, red-hot iron,
    Driven away from himself into her tracks,
    Forced to crash against her.

    Stiff, gallant, irascible, crook-legged reptile,
    Little gentleman,
    Sorry plight,
    We ought to look the other way.

    Save that, having come with you so far,
    We will go on to the end.




TORTOISE SHOUT


    I thought he was dumb,
    I said he was dumb,
    Yet I've heard him cry.

    First faint scream,
    Out of life's unfathomable dawn,
    Far off, so far, like a madness, under the horizon's dawning rim,
    Far, far off, far scream.

    Tortoise _in extremis_.

    Why were we crucified into sex?
    Why were we not left rounded off, and finished in ourselves,
    As we began,
    As he certainly began, so perfectly alone?

    A far, was-it-audible scream,
    Or did it sound on the plasm direct?

    Worse than the cry of the new-born,
    A scream,
    A yell,
    A shout,
    A paean,
    A death-agony,
    A birth-cry,
    A submission,
    All tiny, tiny, far away, reptile under the first dawn.
    War-cry, triumph, acute delight, death-scream reptilian,
    Why was the veil torn?
    The silken shriek of the soul's torn membrane?
    The male soul's membrane
    Torn with a shriek half music, half horror.

    Crucifixion.

    Male tortoise, cleaving behind the hovel-wall of that dense female,
    Mounted and tense, spread-eagle, out-reaching out of the shell
    In tortoise-nakedness,
    Long neck, and long vulnerable limbs extruded, spread-eagle over her house-roof,
    And the deep, secret, all-penetrating tail curved beneath her walls,
    Reaching and gripping tense, more reaching anguish in uttermost tension
    Till suddenly, in the spasm of coition, tupping like a
       jerking leap, and oh!
    Opening its clenched face from his outstretched neck
    And giving that fragile yell, that scream,
    Super-audible,
    From his pink, cleft, old-man's mouth,
    Giving up the ghost,
    Or screaming in Pentecost, receiving the ghost.

    His scream, and his moment's subsidence,
    The moment of eternal silence,
    Yet unreleased, and after the moment, the sudden, startling
         jerk of coition, and at once
    The inexpressible faint yell -- 
    And so on, till the last plasm of my body was melted back
    To the primeval rudiments of life, and the secret.

    So he tups, and screams
    Time after time that frail, torn scream
    After each jerk, the longish interval,
    The tortoise eternity,
    Age-long, reptilian persistence,
    Heart-throb, slow heart-throb, persistent for the next spasm.

    I remember, when I was a boy,
    I heard the scream of a frog, which was caught with his foot in the mouth
        of an up-starting snake;
    I remember when I first heard bull-frogs break into sound in the spring;
    I remember hearing a wild goose out of the throat of night
    Cry loudly, beyond the lake of waters;
    I remember the first time, out of a bush in the darkness, a nightingale's
        piercing cries and gurgles startled the depths of my soul;
    I remember the scream of a rabbit as I went through a wood at midnight;
    I remember the heifer in her heat, blorting and blorting through the hours,
        persistent and irrepressible;
    I remember my first terror hearing the howl of weird, amorous cats;
    I remember the scream of a terrified, injured horse, the sheet-lightning,
    And running away from the sound of a woman in labour, something like an
       owl whooing,
    And listening inwardly to the first bleat of a lamb,
    The first wail of an infant,
    And my mother singing to herself,
    And the first tenor singing of the passionate throat of a young collier,
        who has long since drunk himself to death,
    The first elements of foreign speech
    On wild dark lips.

    And more than all these,
    And less than all these,
    This last,
    Strange, faint coition yell
    Of the male tortoise at extremity,
    Tiny from under the very edge of the farthest far-off horizon of life.

    The cross,
    The wheel on which our silence first is broken,
    Sex, which breaks up our integrity, our single inviolability, our deep silence
    Tearing a cry from us.

    Sex, which breaks us into voice, sets us calling across the deeps, calling,
        calling for the complement,
    Singing, and calling, and singing again, being answered, having found.

    Torn, to become whole again, after long seeking for what is lost,
    The same cry from the tortoise as from Christ, the Osiris-cry of abandonment,
    That which is whole, torn asunder,
    That which is in part, finding its whole again throughout the universe.




BIRDS




TURKEY-COCK


    You ruffled black blossom,
    You glossy dark wind.

    Your sort of gorgeousness,
    Dark and lustrous
    And skinny repulsive
    And poppy-glossy,
    Is the gorgeousness that evokes my most puzzled admiration.

    Your aboriginality
    Deep, unexplained,
    Like a Red Indian darkly unfinished and aloof,
    Seems like the black and glossy seeds of countless centuries.

    Your wattles are the colour of steel-slag which has been red-hot
    And is going cold,
    Cooling to a powdery, pale-oxydised sky-blue.

    Why do you have wattles, and a naked, wattled head?
    Why do you arch your naked-set eye with a more-than-comprehensible arrogance?

    The vulture is bald, so is the condor, obscenely,
    But only you have thrown this amazing mantilla of oxydised sky-blue
    And hot red over you.

    This queer dross shawl of blue and vermilion,
    Whereas the peacock has a diadem.

    I wonder why.
    Perhaps it is a sort of uncanny decoration, a veil of loose skin.
    Perhaps it is your assertion, in all this ostentation, of raw contradictoriness.
    Your wattles drip down like a shawl to your breast
    And the point of your mantilla drops across your nose, unpleasantly.

    Or perhaps it is something unfinished
    A bit of slag still adhering, after your firing in the furnace of creation.

    Or perhaps there is something in your wattles of a bull's dew-lap
    Which slips down like a pendulum to balance the throbbing mass of
         a generous breast,

    The over-drip of a great passion hanging in the balance.
    Only yours would be a raw, unsmelted passion, that will not quite fuse from
        the dross.

    You contract yourself,
    You arch yourself as an archer's bow
    Which quivers indrawn as you clench your spine
    Until your veiled head almost touches backward
    To the root-rising of your erected tail.
    And one intense and backward-curving frisson
    Seizes you as you clench yourself together
    Like some fierce magnet bringing its poles together.
    Burning, pale positive pole of your wattled head!
    And from the darkness of that opposite one
    The upstart of your round-barred, sun-round tail!

    Whilst between the two, along the tense arch of your back
    Blows the magnetic current in fierce blasts,
    Ruffling black, shining feathers like lifted mail,
    Shuddering storm wind, or a water rushing through.

    Your brittle, super-sensual arrogance
    Tosses the crape of red across your brow and down your breast
    As you draw yourself upon yourself in insistence.

    It is a declaration of such tension in will
    As time has not dared to avouch, nor eternity been able to unbend
    Do what it may.
    A raw American will, that has never been tempered by life;
    You brittle, will-tense bird with a foolish eye.

    The peacock lifts his rods of bronze
    And struts blue-brilliant out of the far East.
    But watch a turkey prancing low on earth
    Drumming his vaulted wings, as savages drum
    Their rhythms on long-drawn, hollow, sinister drums.
    The ponderous, sombre sound of the great drum of Huichilobos
    In pyramid Mexico, during sacrifice.
    Drum, and the turkey onrush
    Sudden, demonic dauntlessness, full abreast,
    All the bronze gloss of all his myriad petals
    Each one apart and instant.
    Delicate frail crescent of the gentle outline of white
    At each feather-tip
    So delicate;
    Yet the bronze wind-well suddenly clashing
    And the eye over-weening into madness.

    Turkey-cock, turkey-cock
    Are you the bird of the next dawn?

    Has the peacock had his day, does he call in vain, screecher, for the sun
        to rise?
    The eagle, the dove, and the barnyard rooster, do they call in vain, trying
        to wake the morrow?
    And do you await us, wattled father, Westward?
    Will your yell do it?

    Take up the trail of the vanished American
    Where it disappeared at the foot of the crucifix.
    Take up the primordial Indian obstinacy,
    The more than human, dense insistence of will,
    And disdain, and blankness, and onrush, and prise open the new day with
       them?

    The East a dead letter, and Europe moribund.... Is that so?
    And those sombre, dead, feather-lustrous Aztecs, Amerindians,
    In all the sinister splendour of their red blood sacrifices,
    Do they stand under the dawn, half-godly, half-demon, awaiting the cry of
        the turkey-cock?

    Or must you go through the fire once more, till you're smelted pure,
    Slag-wattled turkey-cock,
    Dross-jabot?




HUMMING-BIRD


    I can imagine, in some otherworld
    Primeval-dumb, far back
    In that most awful stillness, that only gasped and hummed,
    Humming-birds raced down the avenues.

    Before anything had a soul,
    While life was a heave of Matter, half inanimate,
    This little bit chipped off in brilliance
    And went whizzing through the slow, vast, succulent stems.

    I believe there were no flowers, then
    In the world where the humming-bird flashed ahead of creation.
    I believe he pierced the slow vegetable veins with his long beak.

    Probably he was big
    As mosses, and little lizards, they say were once big.
    Probably he was a jabbing, terrifying monster.

    We look at him through the wrong end of the long telescope of Time,
    Luckily for us.





EAGLE IN NEW MEXICO


    Towards the sun, towards the south-west
    A scorched breast.
    A scorched breast, breasting the sun like an answer,
    Like a retort.

    An eagle at the top of a low cedar-bush
    On the sage-ash desert
    Reflecting the scorch of the sun from his breast;
    Eagle, with the sickle dripping darkly above.

    Erect, scorched-pallid out of the hair of the cedar,
    Erect, with the god-thrust entering him from below,
    Eagle gloved in feathers
    In scorched white feathers
    In burnt dark feathers
    In feathers still fire-rusted;
    Sickle-overswept, sickle dripping over and above.

    Sun-breaster,
    Staring two ways at once, to right and left;
    Masked-one
    Dark-visaged
    Sickle-masked
    With iron between your two eyes;
    You feather-gloved
    To the feet;
    Foot-fierce;
    Erect one;
    The god-thrust entering you steadily from below.

    You never look at the sun with your two eyes.
    Only the inner eye of your scorched broad breast
    Looks straight at the sun.

    You are dark
    Except scorch-pale-breasted;
    And dark cleaves down and weapon-hard downward curving
    At your scorched breast,
    Like a sword of Damocles,
    Beaked eagle.

    You've dipped it in blood so many times
    That dark face-weapon, to temper it well,
    Blood-thirsty bird.

    Why do you front the sun so obstinately,
    American eagle?
    As if you owed him an old, old grudge, great sun: or an old, old allegiance.

    When you pick the red smoky heart from a rabbit or a light-blooded bird
    Do you lift it to the sun, as the Aztec priests used to lift red hearts
       of men?

    Does the sun need steam of blood do you think
    In America, still,
    Old eagle?

    Does the sun in New Mexico sail like a fiery bird of prey in the sky
    Hovering?

    Does he shriek for blood?
    Does he fan great wings above the prairie, like a hovering, blood-thirsty
        bird?

    And are you his priest, big eagle
    Whom the Indians aspire to?
    Is there a bond of bloodshed between you?

    Is your continent cold from the ice-age still, that the sun is so angry?
    Is the blood of your continent somewhat reptilian still,
    That the sun should be greedy for it?

    I don't yield to you, big, jowl-faced eagle.
    Nor you nor your blood-thirsty sun
    That sucks up blood
    Leaving a nervous people.

    Fly off, big bird with a big black back,
    Fly slowly away, with a rust of fire in your tail,
    Dark as you are on your dark side, eagle of heaven.

    Even the sun in heaven can be curbed and chastened at last
    By the life in the hearts of men.
    And you, great bird, sun-starer, heavy black beak
    Can be put out of office as sacrifice bringer.





THE BLUE JAY


    The blue jay with a crest on his head
    Comes round the cabin in the snow.
    He runs in the snow like a bit of blue metal,
    Turning his back on everything.

    From the pine-tree that towers and hisses like a pillar of shaggy cloud
    Immense above the cabin
    Comes a strident laugh as we approach, this little black dog and I.
    So halts the little black bitch on four spread paws in the snow
    And looks up inquiringly into the pillar of cloud,
    With a tinge of misgiving.
    _Ca-a-a!_ comes the scrape of ridicule out of the tree.

    _What voice of the Lord is that, from the tree of smoke?_

    Oh Bibbles, little black bitch in the snow,
    With a pinch of snow in the groove of your silly snub nose.
    What do you look at _me_ for?
    What do you look at me for, with such misgiving?

    It's the blue jay laughing at us.
    It's the blue jay jeering at us, Bibs.

    Every day since the snow is here
    The blue jay paces round the cabin, very busy, picking up bits,
    Turning his back on us all,
    And bobbing his thick dark crest about the snow, as if darkly saying:
    _I ignore those folk who look out_.

    You acid-blue metallic bird,
    You thick bird with a strong crest
    Who are you?
    Whose boss are you, with all your bully way?
    You copper-sulphate blue-bird!





ANIMALS




THE ASS


    The long-drawn bray of the ass
    In the Sicilian twilight -- 

    _All mares are dead!_
    _All mares are dead!_
    _Oh-h!_
    _Oh-h-h!_
    _Oh-h-h-h-h--h!!_
    _I can't bear it, I can't bear it,_
    _I can't!_
    _Oh, I can't!_
    _Oh -- _
    _There's one left!_
    _There's one left!_
    _One!_
    _There's one ... left...._

    So ending on a grunt of agonised relief.

    This is the authentic Arabic interpretation of the braying of the ass.
    And Arabs should know.

    And yet, as his brass-resonant howling yell resounds through the Sicilian
        twilight
    I am not sure -- 

    His big, furry head,
    His big, regretful eyes,
    His diminished, drooping hindquarters,
    His small toes.

    Such a dear!
    Such an ass!
    With such a knot inside him!
    He regrets something that he remembers.
    That's obvious.

    The Steppes of Tartary,
    And the wind in his teeth for a bit,
    And _noli me tangere_.

    Ah then, when he tore the wind with his teeth,
    And trod wolves underfoot,
    And over-rode his mares as if he were savagely leaping an obstacle, to set
        his teeth in the sun....

    Somehow, alas, he fell in love,
    And was sold into slavery.

    He fell into the rut of love,
    Poor ass, like man, always in a rut,
    The pair of them alike in that.

    All his soul in his gallant member
    And his head gone heavy with the knowledge of desire
    And humiliation.

    The ass was the first of all animals to fall finally into love,
    From obstacle-leaping pride,
    Mare obstacle,
    Into love, mare-goal, and the knowledge of love.
    Hence Jesus rode him in the Triumphant Entry.
    Hence his beautiful eyes.
    Hence his ponderous head, brooding over desire, and downfall,
        Jesus, and a pack-saddle,
    Hence he uncovers his big ass-teeth and howls in that agony that is
        half-insatiable desire and half-unquenchable humiliation.
    Hence the black cross on his shoulders.

    The Arabs were only half right, though they hinted the whole;
    Everlasting lament in everlasting desire.

    See him standing with his head down, near the Porta Cappuccini,
    Asinello,
    Somaro;
    With the half-veiled, beautiful eyes, and the pensive face not asleep,
    Motionless, like a bit of rock.

    Has he seen the Gorgon's head, and turned to stone?
    Alas, Love did it.
    Now he's a jackass, a pack-ass, a donkey, somaro, burro, with a boss piling
        loads on his back.
    Tied by the nose at the Porta Cappuccini.
    And tied in a knot, inside, dead-licked between two desires:
    To overleap like a male all mares as obstacles
    In a leap at the sun;
    And to leap in one last heart-bursting leap like a male at the
        goal of a mare,
    And there end.
    Well, you can't have it both roads.

    _Hee! Hee! Ehee! Ehow! Ehaw!! Oh! Oh! Oh-h-h!!_
    The wave of agony bursts in the stone that he was,
    Bares his long ass's teeth, flattens his long ass's ears, straightens his
        donkey neck,
    And howls his pandemonium on the indignant air.

    Yes, it's a quandary.
    Jesus rode on him, the first burden on the first beast of burden.
    Love on a submissive ass.
    So the tale began.

    But the ass never forgets.

    The horse, being nothing but a nag, will forget.
    And men, being mostly geldings and knacker-boned hacks, have almost all
       forgot.
    But the ass is a primal creature, and never forgets.

    The Steppes of Tartary,
    And Jesus on a meek ass-colt: mares: Mary escaping to Egypt: Joseph's cudgel.

    _Hee! Hee! Ehee! Ehow-ow-!-ow!-aw!-aw!-aw!_
    _All mares are dead!_
    _Or else I am dead!_
    _One of us, or the pair of us,_
    _I don't know -- ow! -- ow!_
    _Which!_
    _Not sure -- ure -- ure_
    _Quite which!_
    _Which!_





HE-GOAT


    See his black nose snubbed back, pressed over like a whale's blow-holes,
    As if his nostrils were going to curve back to the root of his tail.

    As he charges slow among the herd
    And rows among the females like a ship pertinaciously,
    Heavy with a rancid cargo, through the lesser ships -- 
    Old father
    Sniffing forever ahead of him, at the rear of the goats, that they lift
       the little door,
    And rowing on, unarrived, no matter how often he enter:
    Like a big ship pushing her bowsprit over the little ships
    Then swerving and steering afresh
    And never, never arriving at journey's end, at the rear of the female ships.

    Yellow eyes incomprehensible with thin slits
    To round-eyed us.

    Yet if you had whorled horns of bronze in a frontal dark wall
    At the end of a back-bone ridge, like a straight sierra roquena,
    And nerves urging forward to the wall, you'd have eyes like his,
    Especially if, being given a needle's eye of egress elsewhere
    You tried to look back to it, and couldn't.
    Sometimes he turns with a start, to fight, to challenge, to suddenly butt.
    And then you see the God that he is, in a cloud of black hair
    And storm-lightning-slitted eye.
    Splendidly planting his feet, one rocky foot striking the ground with a
       sudden rock-hammer announcement.

    _I am here!_
    And suddenly lowering his head, the whorls of bone and of horn
    Slowly revolving towards unexploded explosion,
    As from the stem of his bristling, lightning-conductor tail
    In a rush up the shrieking duct of his vertebral way
    Runs a rage drawn in from the other divinely through him
    Towards a shock and a crash and a smiting of horns ahead.

    That is a grand old lust of his, to gather the great
    Rage of the sullen-stagnating atmosphere of goats
    And bring it hurtling to a head, with crash of horns against the horns
    Of the opposite enemy goat,
    Thus hammering the mettle of goats into proof, and smiting out
    The godhead of goats from the shock.
    Things of iron are beaten on the anvil,
    And he-goat is anvil to he-goat, and hammer to he-goat
    In the business of beating the mettle of goats to a godhead.

    But they've taken his enemy from him
    And left him only his libidinousness,
    His nostrils turning back, to sniff at even himself
    And his slitted eyes seeking the needle's eye,
    His own, unthreaded, forever.

    So it is, when they take the enemy from us,
    And we can't fight.

    He is not fatherly, like the bull, massive Providence of hot blood;
    The goat is an egoist, aware of himself, devilish aware of himself,
    And full of malice prepense, and overweening, determined to stand
        on the highest peak
    Like the devil, and look on the world as his own.

    And as for love:
    With a needle of long red flint he stabs in the dark
    At the living rock he is up against;
    While she with her goaty mouth stands smiling the while as he strikes, since sure
    He will never _quite_ strike home, on the target-quick, for her quick
    Is just beyond range of the arrow he shoots
    From his leap at the zenith in her, so it falls just short of the mark,
       far enough.
    It is over before it is finished.
    She, smiling with goaty munch-mouth, Mona Lisa, arranges it so.
    Orgasm after orgasm after orgasm
    And he smells so rank and his nose goes back,
    And never an enemy brow-metalled to thresh it out with in the open field;
    Never a mountain peak, to be king of the castle.
    Only those eternal females to overleap and surpass, and never succeed.

    The involved voluptuousness of the soft-footed cat
    Who is like a fur folding a fur,
    The cat who laps blood, and knows
    The soft welling of blood invincible even beyond bone or metal of bone.

    The soft, the secret, the unfathomable blood
    The cat has lapped
    And known it subtler than frisson-shaken nerves,
    Stronger than multiplicity of bone on bone
    And darker than even the arrows of violentest will
    Can pierce, for that is where will gives out, like a sinking stone that
       can sink no further.

    But he-goat,
    Black procreant male of the selfish will and libidinous desire,
    God in black cloud with curving horns of bronze,
    Find an enemy, Egoist, and clash the cymbals in face-to-face defiance,
    And let the lightning out of your smothered dusk.

    Forget the female herd for a bit,
    And fight to be boss of the world.
    Fight, old Satan with a selfish will, fight for your selfish will;
    Fight to be the devil on the tip of the peak
    Overlooking the world for his own.

    But bah, how can he, poor domesticated beast!




SHE-GOAT


    Goats go past the back of the house like dry leaves in the dawn,
    And up the hill like a river, if you watch.

    At dusk they patter back like a bough being dragged on the ground,
    Raising dusk and acridity of goats, and bleating.

    Our old goat we tie up at night in the shed at the back of the broken Greek
        tomb in the garden,
    And when the herd goes by at dawn she begins to bleat for me to come down
        and untie her.

    _Merr -- err -- err! Merr -- er -- errr! Mer! M !_
    _Wait, wait a bit, I'll come when I've lit the fire._
    _Merrr!_
    _Exactly._
    _M ! Mer! Merrrrrrr!!!_
    _Tace, tu, crapa, bestia!_
    _Merr-ererrr-ererrrr! Merrrr!_

    She is such an alert listener, with her ears wide, to know am I coming!
    Such a canny listener, from a distance, looking upwards, lending first one
        ear, then another.

    There she is, perched on her manger, looking over the boards into the day
    Like a belle at her window.

    And immediately she sees me she blinks, stares, doesn't know me, turns her
        head and ignores me vulgarly with a wooden blank on her face.

    What do I care for her, the ugly female, standing up there with her
        long tangled sides like an old rug thrown over a fence.
    But she puts her nose down shrewdly enough when the knot is untied,
    And jumps staccato to earth, a sharp, dry jump, still ignoring me,
    Pretending to look round the stall.

    _Come on, you, crapa! I'm not your servant!_

    She turns her head away with an obtuse, female sort of deafness, b te.
    And then invariably she crouches her rear and makes water.
    That being her way of answer, if I speak to her. -- Self-conscious!
    _Le bestie non parlano, poverine!_

    She was bought at Giardini fair, on the sands, for six hundred lire.

    An obstinate old witch, almost jerking the rope from my hands to eat
       the acanthus, or bite at the almond buds, and make me wait.
    Yet the moment I hate her she trips mild and smug like a woman going to
       mass.
    The moment I really detest her.

    Queer it is, suddenly, in the garden
    To catch sight of her standing like some huge, ghoulish grey bird in
        the air, on the bough of the leaning almond-tree,
    Straight as a board on the bough, looking down like some hairy horrid God
        the Father in a William Blake imagination.
    _Come down, crapa, out of that almond tree!_

    Instead of which she strangely rears on her perch in the air, vast beast,
    And strangely paws the air, delicate,
    And reaches her black-striped face up like a snake, far up,
    Subtly, to the twigs overhead, far up, vast beast,
    And snaps them sharp, with a little twist of her anaconda head;
    All her great hairy-shaggy belly open against the morning.

    At seasons she curls back her tail like a green leaf in the fire,
    Or like a lifted hand, hailing at her wrong end.
    And having exposed the pink place of her nakedness, fixedly,
    She trots on blithe toes,
    And if you look at her, she looks back with a cold, sardonic stare.
    Sardonic, sardonyx, rock of cold fire.
    _See me?_ She says, _That's me!_

    That's her.

    Then she leaps the rocks like a quick rock,
    Her back-bone sharp as a rock,
    Sheer will.

    Along which ridge of libidinous magnetism
    Defiant, curling the leaf of her tail as if she were curling her lip behind
        her at all life,
    Libidinous desire runs back and forth, asserting itself in that little lifted bare hand.

    Yet she has such adorable spurty kids, like spurts of black ink.
    And in a month again is as if she had never had them.

    And when the billy goat mounts her
    She is brittle as brimstone.
    While his slitted eyes squint back to the roots of his ears.





ELEPHANT


    You go down shade to the river, where naked men sit on flat brown rocks, to
        watch the ferry, in the sun;
    And you cross the ferry with the naked people, go up the tropical lane
    Through the palm-trees and past hollow paddy-fields where naked men are
       threshing rice
    And the monolithic water-buffaloes, like old, muddy stones with hair on
       them, are being idle;
    And through the shadow of bread-fruit trees, with their dark green, glossy,
        fanged leaves
    Very handsome, and some pure yellow fanged leaves;
    Out into the open, where the path runs on the top of a dyke between paddy-fields:
    And there, of course, you meet a huge and mud-grey elephant advancing his
        frontal bone, his trunk curled round a log of wood:
    So you step down the bank, to make way.

    Shuffle, shuffle, and his little wicked eye has seen you as he advances
       above you,
    The slow beast curiously spreading his round feet for the dust.
    And the slim naked man slips down, and the beast deposits the lump of wood,
        carefully.
    The keeper hooks the vast knee, the creature salaams.

    White man, you are saluted.
    Pay a few cents.

    But the best is the Pera-hera, at midnight, under the tropical stars,
    With a pale little wisp of a Prince of Wales, diffident, up in a small
         pagoda on the temple side
    And white people in evening dress buzzing and crowding the stand upon the
        grass below and opposite:
    And at last the Pera-hera procession, flambeaux aloft in the tropical
         night, of blazing cocoa-nut,
    Naked dark men beneath,
    And the huge frontal of three great elephants stepping forth to the
         tom-tom's beat, in the torch-light,
    Slowly sailing in gorgeous apparel through the flame-light, in front of
       a towering, grimacing white image of wood.

    The elephant bells striking slow, tong-tong, tong-tong,
    To music and queer chanting:
    Enormous shadow-processions filing on in the flare of fire
    In the fume of cocoa-nut oil, in the sweating tropical night,
    In the noise of the tom-toms and singers;
    Elephants after elephants curl their trunks, vast shadows, and some cry
       out
    As they approach and salaam, under the dripping fire of the torches
    That pale fragment of a Prince up there, whose motto is _Ich dien_.

    Pale, dispirited Prince, with his chin on his hands, his nerves tired out,
    Watching and hardly seeing the trunk-curl approach and clumsy, knee-lifting
        salaam
    Of the hugest, oldest of beasts in the night and the fire-flare below.
    He is royalty, pale and dejected fragment up aloft.
    And down below huge homage of shadowy beasts; barefoot and trunk-lipped
       in the night.

    Chieftains, three of them abreast, on foot
    Strut like peg-tops, wound around with hundreds of yards of fine linen.
    They glimmer with tissue of gold, and golden threads on a jacket of velvet,
    And their faces are dark, and fat, and important.

    They are royalty, dark-faced royalty, showing the conscious whites of their
        eyes
    And stepping in homage, stubborn, to that nervous pale lad up there.

    More elephants, tong, tong-tong, loom up,
    Huge, more tassels swinging, more dripping fire of new cocoa-nut cressets
    High, high flambeaux, smoking of the east;
    And scarlet hot embers of torches knocked out of the sockets among bare
       feet of elephants and men on the path in the dark.
    And devil dancers luminous with sweat, dancing on to the shudder of drums,
    Tom-toms, weird music of the devil, voices of men from the jungle singing;
    Endless, under the Prince.

    Towards the tail of the everlasting procession
    In the long hot night, mere dancers from insignificant villages,
    And smaller, more frightened elephants.
    Men-peasants from jungle villages dancing and running with sweat and laughing,
    Naked dark men with ornaments on, on their naked arms and their naked
         breasts, the grooved loins
    Gleaming like metal with running sweat as they suddenly turn, feet apart,
    And dance, and dance, forever dance, with breath half sobbing in dark, sweat-shining breasts,
    And lustrous great tropical eyes unveiled now, gleaming a kind of laugh,
    A naked, gleaming dark laugh, like a secret out in the dark,
    And flare of a tropical energy, tireless, afire in the dark, slim limbs
       and breasts,
    Perpetual, fire-laughing motion, among the slow shuffle
    Of elephants,
    The hot dark blood of itself a-laughing, wet, half-devilish, men all motion
    Approaching under that small pavilion, and tropical eyes dilated look up
    Inevitably look up
    To the Prince
    To that tired remnant of royalty up there
    Whose motto is _Ich dien_.

    As if the homage of the kindled blood of the east
    Went up in wavelets to him, from the breasts and eyes of jungle torch-men,
    And he couldn't take it.

    What would they do, those jungle men running with sweat, with the strange
        dark laugh in their eyes, glancing up,
    And the sparse-haired elephants slowly following,
    If they knew that his motto was _Ich dien_?
    And that he meant it.

    They begin to understand
    The rickshaw boys begin to understand
    And then the devil comes into their faces,
    But a different sort, a cold, rebellious, jeering devil.

    In elephants and the east are two devils, in all men maybe.
    The mystery of the dark mountain of blood, reeking in homage, in lust, in
        rage,
    And passive with everlasting patience,
    Then the little, cunning pig-devil of the elephant's lurking eyes, the unbeliever.

    We dodged, when the Pera-hera was finished, under the hanging, hairy
         pigs' tails
    And the flat, flaccid mountains of the elephants' standing haunches,
    Vast-blooded beasts,
    Myself so little dodging rather scared against the eternal wrinkled pillars
        of their legs, as they were being dismantled;
    Then I knew they were dejected, having come to hear the repeated
    Royal summons: _Dient Ihr!_
    _Serve!_
    _Serve, vast mountainous blood, in submission and splendour, serve royalty._
    Instead of which, the silent, fatal emission from that pale, shattered boy
        up there:
    _Ich dien._

    That's why the night fell in frustration.
    That's why, as the elephants ponderously, with unseeming swiftness, galloped
        uphill in the night, going back to the jungle villages,
    As the elephant bells sounded tong-tong-tong, bell of the temple of blood
        in the night, swift-striking,
    And the crowd like a field of rice in the dark gave way like liquid to the
        dark
    Looming gallop of the beasts,
    It was as if the great bare bulks of elephants in the obscure light went
        over the hill-brow swiftly, with their tails between their legs,
         in haste to get away,
    Their bells sounding frustrate and sinister.

    And all the dark-faced, cotton-wrapped people, more numerous and whispering
        than grains of rice in a ricefield at night,
    All the dark-faced, cotton-wrapped people, a countless host on the shores
        of the lake, like thick wild rice by the water's edge,
    Waiting for the fireworks of the after-show,
    As the rockets went up, and the glare passed over countless faces, dark
       as black rice growing,
    Showing a glint of teeth, and glancing tropical eyes aroused in the night,
    There was the faintest twist of mockery in every face, across the hiss of
        wonders as the rocket burst
    High, high up, in flakes, shimmering flakes of blue fire, above the palm-trees
        of the islet in the lake,
    O faces upturned to the glare, O tropical wonder, wonder, a miracle in heaven!
    And the shadow of a jeer, of underneath disappointment, as the rocket-coruscation
        died, and shadow was the same as before.

    They were foiled, the myriad whispering dark-faced cotton-wrapped people.
    They had come to see royalty,
    To bow before royalty, in the land of elephants, bow deep, bow deep.
    Bow deep, for it's good as a draught of cool water to bow very, very low to
        the royal.

    And all there was to bow to, a weary, diffident boy whose motto is _Ich
       dien_.
    _I serve! I serve!_ in all the weary iron of his mien -- _'Tis I who serve!_
    Drudge to the public.

    I wish they had given the three feathers to me;
    That I had been he in the pavilion, as in a pepper-box aloft and alone
    To stand and hold feathers, three feathers above the world,
    And say to them: _Dient Ihr! Dient!_
    _Omnes, vos omnes, servite._
    _Serve me, I am meet to be served._
    _Being royal of the gods._

    And to the elephants:
    _First great beasts of the earth
    A prince has come back to you,
    Blood-mountains.
    Crook the knee and be glad._





KANGAROO


    In the northern hemisphere
    Life seems to leap at the air, or skim under the wind
    Like stags on rocky ground, or pawing horses, or springy scut-tailed rabbits.

    Or else rush horizontal to charge at the sky's horizon,
    Like bulls or bisons or wild pigs.

    Or slip like water slippery towards its ends,
    As foxes, stoats, and wolves, and prairie dogs.

    Only mice, and moles, and rats, and badgers, and beavers, and perhaps bears
    Seem belly-plumbed to the earth's mid-navel.
    Or frogs that when they leap come flop, and flop to the centre of the earth.

    But the yellow antipodal Kangaroo, when she sits up,
    Who can unseat her, like a liquid drop that is heavy, and just touches earth.

    The downward drip.
    The down-urge.
    So much denser than cold-blooded frogs.

    Delicate mother Kangaroo
    Sitting up there rabbit-wise, but huge, plumb-weighted,
    And lifting her beautiful slender face, oh! so much more gently and finely
        lined than a rabbit's, or than a hare's,
    Lifting her face to nibble at a round white peppermint drop,
         which she loves, sensitive mother Kangaroo.

    Her sensitive, long, pure-bred face.
    Her full antipodal eyes, so dark,
    So big and quiet and remote, having watched so many empty dawns in silent
        Australia.

    Her little loose hands, and drooping Victorian shoulders.
    And then her great weight below the waist, her vast pale belly
    With a thin young yellow little paw hanging out, and straggle of a long
       thin ear, like ribbon,
    Like a funny trimming to the middle of her belly, thin little dangle of
       an immature paw, and one thin ear.

    Her belly, her big haunches
    And in addition, the great muscular python-stretch of her tail.

    There, she shan't have any more peppermint drops.
    So she wistfully, sensitively sniffs the air, and then turns, goes off in
        slow sad leaps

    On the long flat skis of her legs,
    Steered and propelled by that steel-strong snake of a tail.

    Stops again, half turns, inquisitive to look back.
    While something stirs quickly in her belly, and a lean little face comes
        out, as from a window,
    Peaked and a bit dismayed,
    Only to disappear again quickly away from the sight of the world, to
        snuggle down in the warmth,
    Leaving the trail of a different paw hanging out.

    Still she watches with eternal, cocked wistfulness!
    How full her eyes are, like the full, fathomless, shining eyes of an
        Australian black-boy
    Who has been lost so many centuries on the margins of existence!

    She watches with insatiable wistfulness.
    Untold centuries of watching for something to come,
    For a new signal from life, in that silent lost land of the South.

    Where nothing bites but insects and snakes and the sun, small life.
    Where no bull roared, no cow ever lowed, no stag cried, no leopard
        screeched, no lion coughed, no dog barked,
    But all was silent save for parrots occasionally, in the haunted blue bush.

    Wistfully watching, with wonderful liquid eyes.
    And all her weight, all her blood, dripping sack-wise down towards the
         earth's centre,
    And the live little one taking in its paw at the door of her belly.

    Leap then, and come down on the line that draws to the earth's deep, heavy
        centre.

BIBBLES


    Bibbles
    Little black dog in New Mexico,
    Little black snub-nosed bitch with a shoved-out jaw
    And a wrinkled reproachful look;
    Little black female pup, sort of French bull, they say,
    With bits of brindle coming through, like rust, to show you're not pure;
    Not pure, Bibbles,
    Bubsey, bat-eared dog;
    Not black enough!

    First live thing I've owned since the lop-eared rabbits when I was a lad,
    And those over-prolific white mice, and Adolf, and Rex whom I didn't own.
    And even now, Bibbles, little Ma'am, it's you who appropriated me, not I you.
    As Benjamin Franklin appropriated Providence to his purposes.

    Oh Bibbles, black little bitch
    I'd never have let you appropriate me, had I known.
    I never dreamed, till now, of the awful time the Lord must have, owning
        humanity,
    Especially democratic live-by-love humanity.

    Oh Bibbles, oh Pips, oh Pipsey
    You little black love-bird!

    _Don't_ you love _everybody_!
    Just everybody.
    You love 'em all.
    Believe in the One Identity, don't you,
    You little Walt-Whitmanesque bitch?

    First time I lost you in Taos plaza,
    And found you after endless chasing,
    Came upon you prancing round the corner in exuberant, bibbling affection
    After the black-green skirts of a yellow-green old Mexican woman
    Who hated you, and kept looking round at you and cursing you in a mutter,
    While you pranced and bounced with love of her, you indiscriminating animal,
    All your wrinkled _miserere_ Chinese black little face beaming
    And your black little body bouncing and wriggling
    With indiscriminate love, Bibbles;
    I had a moment's pure detestation of you.

    As I rushed like an idiot round the corner after you
    Yelling: _Pips! Pips! Bibbles!_

    I've had moments of hatred of you since,
    Loving everybody!
    To you, whoever you are, with endless embrace! -- 
    That's you, Pipsey,
    With your imbecile bit of a tail in a love-flutter.
    You omnipip.

    Not that you're merely a softy, oh dear me no.
    You know which side your bread is buttered.
    You don't care a rap for anybody.
    But you love lying warm between warm human thighs, indiscriminate,
    And you love to make somebody love you, indiscriminate,
    You love to lap up affection, to wallow in it,
    And then turn tail to the next comer, for a new dollop.

    And start prancing and licking and cuddling again, indiscriminate.

    Oh yes, I know your little game.

    Yet you're so nice,
    So quick, like a little black dragon.
    So fierce, when the coyotes howl, barking like a whole little lion, and
       rumbling,
    And starting forward in the dusk, with your little black fur all bristling
        like plush
    Against those coyotes, who would swallow you like an oyster.

    And in the morning, when the bedroom door is opened,
    Rushing in like a little black whirlwind, leaping straight as an arrow on
        the bed at the pillow
    And turning the day suddenly into a black tornado of _joie de vivre_, Chinese dragon.

    So funny
    Lobbing wildly through deep snow like a rabbit,
    Hurtling like a black ball through the snow,
    Champing it, tossing a mouthful,
    Little black spot in the landscape!

    So absurd
    Pelting behind on the dusty trail when the horse sets off home at a gallop:
    Left in the dust behind like a dust-ball tearing along
    Coming up on fierce little legs, tearing fast to catch up, a real little
        dust-pig, ears almost blown away,
    And black eyes bulging bright in a dust-mask
    Chinese-dragon-wrinkled, with a pink mouth grinning, under jaw shoved out
    And white teeth showing in your dragon-grin as you race, you split-face,
    Like a trundling projectile swiftly whirling up,
    Cocking your eyes at me as you come alongside, to see if I'm I on the horse,
    And panting with that split grin,
    All your game little body dust-smooth like a little pig, poor Pips.

    Plenty of game old spirit in you, Bibbles.
    Plenty of game old spunk, little bitch.

    How you hate being brushed with the boot-brush, to brush all that dust out
        of your wrinkled face,
    Don't you?
    How you hate being made to look undignified, Ma'am;
    How you hate being laughed at, Miss Superb!

    Blackberry face!

    Plenty of conceit in you.
    Unblemished belief in your own perfection
    And utter lovableness, you ugly-mug;
    Chinese puzzle-face,
    Wrinkled underhung physiog that looks as if it had done with everything,
    Through with everything.

    Instead of which you sit there and roll your head like a canary
    And show a tiny bunch of white teeth in your underhung blackness,
    Self-conscious little bitch,
    Aiming again at being loved.

    Let the merest scallywag come to the door and you leap your very dearest-love at him,
    As if now, at last, here was the one you _finally_ loved,
    Finally loved;
    And even the dirtiest scallywag is taken in,
    Thinking: _This dog sure has taken a fancy to me_.

    You miserable little bitch of love-tricks,
    I know your game.

    Me or the Mexican who comes to chop wood
    All the same,
    All humanity is jam to you.

    Everybody so dear, and yourself so ultra-beloved
    That you have to run out at last and eat filth,
    Gobble up filth, you horror, swallow utter abomination and
        fresh-dropped dung.

    You stinker.
    You worse than a carrion-crow.
    Reeking dung-mouth.
    You love-bird.

    _Reject nothing_, sings Walt Whitman.
    So you, you go out at last and eat the unmentionable,
    In your appetite for affection.

    And then you run in to vomit it in my house!
    I get my love back.
    And I have to clean up after you, filth which even blind Nature rejects
    From the pit of your stomach;
    But you, you snout-face, you reject nothing, you merge so much in love
    You must eat even that.

    Then when I dust you a bit with a juniper twig
    You run straight away to live with somebody else,
    Fawn before them, and love them as if they were the ones you had _really_
        loved all along.
    And they're taken in.
    They feel quite tender over you, till you play the same trick on them, dirty bitch.

    Fidelity! Loyalty! Attachment!
    Oh, these are abstractions to your nasty little belly.
    You must always be a-waggle with LOVE.
    Such a waggle of love you can hardly distinguish one human from another.
    You love one after another, on one condition, that each one loves you most.
    Democratic little bull-bitch, dirt-eating little swine.

    But now, my lass, you've got your Nemesis on your track,
    Now you've come sex-alive, and the great ranch-dogs are all after you.
    They're after what they can get, and don't you turn tail!
    You loved 'em all so much before, didn't you, loved 'em indiscriminate.
    You don't love 'em now.
    They want something of you, so you squeak and come pelting indoors.

    Come pelting to me, now the other folk have found you out, and the dogs
       are after you.
    Oh yes, you're found out. I heard them kick you out of the ranch house.
    _Get out, you little, soft fool!!_

    And didn't you turn your eyes up at me then?
    And didn't you cringe on the floor like any inkspot!
    And crawl away like a black snail!
    And doesn't everybody loathe you then!
    And aren't your feelings violated, you high-bred little love-bitch!

    For you're sensitive,
    In many ways very finely bred.
    But bred in conceit that the world is all for love
    Of you, my bitch: till you get so far you eat filth.
    Fool, in spite of your pretty ways, and quaint, know-all,
         wrinkled old aunty's face.

    So now, what with great Airedale dogs,
    And a kick or two,
    And a few vomiting bouts,
    And a juniper switch,
    You look at me for discrimination, don't you?
    Look up at me with misgiving in your bulging eyes,
    And fear in the smoky whites of your eyes, you nigger;
    And you're puzzled,
    You think you'd better mind your P's and Q's for a bit,
    Your sensitive love-pride being all hurt.

    All right, my little bitch.
    You learn loyalty rather than loving,
    And I'll protect you.




MOUNTAIN LION


    Climbing through the January snow, into the Lobo canyon
    Dark grow the spruce-trees, blue is the balsam, water sounds still
         unfrozen, and the trail is still evident.

    Men!
    Two men!
    Men! The only animal in the world to fear!

    They hesitate.
    We hesitate.
    They have a gun.
    We have no gun.

    Then we all advance, to meet.

    Two Mexicans, strangers, emerging out of the dark and snow and inwardness
        of the Lobo valley.
    What are they doing here on this vanishing trail?

    What is he carrying?
    Something yellow.
    A deer?

    _Qu  tiene, amigo?_
    _Le n -- _

    He smiles, foolishly, as if he were caught doing wrong.
    And we smile, foolishly, as if we didn't know.
    He is quite gentle and dark-faced.

    It is a mountain lion,
    A long, long slim cat, yellow like a lioness.
    Dead.

    He trapped her this morning, he says, smiling foolishly.

    Lift up her face,
    Her round, bright face, bright as frost.
    Her round, fine-fashioned head, with two dead ears;
    And stripes in the brilliant frost of her face, sharp, fine dark rays,
    Dark, keen, fine rays in the brilliant frost of her face.
    Beautiful dead eyes.

    _Hermoso es!_

    They go out towards the open;
    We go on into the gloom of Lobo.
    And above the trees I found her lair,
    A hole in the blood-orange brilliant rocks that stick up, a little cave.
    And bones, and twigs, and a perilous ascent.

    So, she will never leap up that way again, with the yellow
         flash of a mountain lion's long shoot!
    And her bright striped frost face will never watch any more, out of the
       shadow of the cave in the blood-orange rock,
    Above the trees of the Lobo dark valley-mouth!

    Instead, I look out.
    And out to the dim of the desert, like a dream, never real;
    To the snow of the Sangre de Cristo mountains, the ice of the mountains
       of Picoris,
    And near across at the opposite steep of snow, green trees motionless
         standing in snow, like a Christmas toy.

    And I think in this empty world there was room for me and a mountain lion
    And I think in the world beyond, how easily we might spare a million or
       two of humans
    And never miss them.
    Yet what a gap in the world, the missing white frost face of that
         slim yellow mountain lion!





THE RED WOLF


    Over the heart of the west, the Taos desert
    Circles an eagle,
    And it's dark between me and him.

    The sun, as he waits a moment, huge and liquid
    Standing without feet on the rim of the far-off mesa
    Says: _Look for a last long time then! Look! Look well! I am going._
    So he pauses and is beholden, and straightway is gone.

    And the Indian, in a white sheet
    Wrapped to the eyes, the sheet bound close on his brows,
    Stands saying: _See, I'm invisible!_
    _Behold how you can't behold me!_
    _The invisible in its shroud!_

    Now that the sun has gone, and the aspen leaves
    And the cotton-wood leaves are fallen, as good as fallen,
    And the ponies are in corral,
    And it's night.

    Why, more has gone than all these;
    And something has come.
    A red wolf stands on the shadow's dark red rim.

    Day has gone to dust on the sage-grey desert
    Like a white Christus fallen to dust from a cross;
    To dust, to ash, on the twilit floor of the desert.

    And a black crucifix like a dead tree spreading wings;
    Maybe a black eagle with its wings out
    Left lonely in the night
    In a sort of worship.

    And coming down upon us, out of the dark concave
    Of the eagle's wings,
    And the coffin-like slit where the Indians' eyes are,
    And the absence of cotton-wood leaves, or of aspen,
    Even the absence of dark-crossed donkeys:
    Come tall old demons, smiling
    The Indian smile,
    Saying: _How do you do, you pale-face?_

    I am very well, old demon.
    How are you?

    _Call me Harry if you will,_
    _Call me Old Harry says he._
    _Or the abbreviation of Nicolas,_
    _Nick. Old Nick, maybe._

    Well, you're a dark old demon,
    And I'm a pale-face like a homeless dog
    That has followed the sun from the dawn through the east
    Trotting east and east and east till the sun himself went home,
    And left me homeless here in the dark at your door.
    How do you think we'll get on,
    Old demon, you and I?

    _You and I, you pale-face,_
    _Pale-face you and I_
    _Don't get on._

    Mightn't we try?

    _Where's your God, you white one?_
    _Where's your white God?_

    He fell to dust as the twilight fell,
    Was fume as I trod
    The last step out of the east.

    _Then you're a lost white dog of a pale-face,_
    _And the days now dead...._

    Touch me carefully, old father,
    My beard is red.

    _Thin red wolf of a pale-face,_
    _Thin red wolf, go home._

    I have no home, old father,
    That's why I come.

    _We take no hungry stray from the pale-face ..._

    Father, you are not asked.
    I am come. I am here. The red-dawn-wolf
    Sniffs round your place.
    Lifts up his voice and howls to the walls of the pueblo,
    Announcing he's here.

    _The dogs of the dark pueblo_
    _Have long fangs ..._

    Has the red wolf trotted east and east and east
    From the far, far other end of the day
    To fear a few fangs?

    Across the pueblo river
    That dark old demon and I
    Thus say a few words to each other

    And wolf, he calls me, and red.
    I call him no names.
    He says, however, he is Star-Road.
    I say, he can go back the same gait.

    As for me ...
    Since I trotted at the tail of the sun as far as ever the creature went
       west,
    And lost him here,
    I'm going to sit down on my tail right here
    And wait for him to come back with a new story.
    I'm the red wolf, says the dark old father.
    All right, the red dawn wolf I am.





GHOSTS




MEN IN NEW MEXICO


    Mountains blanket-wrapped
    Round a white hearth of desert -- 

    While the sun goes round
    And round and round the desert,
    The mountains never get up and walk about.
    They can't, they can't wake.

    They camped and went to sleep
    In the last twilight
    Of Indian gods;
    And they can't wake.

    Indians dance and run and stamp -- 
    No good.
    White men make gold-mines and the mountains unmake them
    In their sleep.

    The Indians laugh in their sleep
    From fear,
    Like a man when he sleeps and his sleep is over, and he can't wake up,
    And he lies like a log and screams and his scream is silent
    Because his body can't wake up;
    So he laughs from fear, pure fear, in the grip of the sleep.

    A dark membrane over the will, holding a man down
    Even when the mind has flickered awake;
    A membrane of sleep, like a black blanket.

    We walk in our sleep, in this land,
    Somnambulist wide-eyed afraid.

    We scream for someone to wake us
    And our scream is soundless in the paralysis of sleep,
    And we know it.

    The Penitentes lash themselves till they run with blood
    In their efforts to come awake for one moment;
    To tear the membrane of this sleep ...
    No good.

    The Indians thought the white man would awake them ...
    And instead, the white men scramble asleep in the mountains,
    And ride on horseback asleep forever through the desert,
    And shoot one another, amazed and mad with somnambulism,
    Thinking death will awaken something ...
    No good.

    Born with a caul,
    A black membrane over the face,
    And unable to tear it,
    Though the mind is awake.

    Mountains blanket-wrapped
    Round the ash-white hearth of the desert;
    And though the sun leaps like a thing unleashed in the sky
    They can't get up, they are under the blanket.
_




AUTUMN AT TAOS


    Over the rounded sides of the Rockies, the aspens of autumn,
    The aspens of autumn,
    Like yellow hair of a tigress brindled with pins.

    Down on my hearth-rug of desert, sage of the mesa,
    An ash-grey pelt
    Of wolf all hairy and level, a wolf's wild pelt.

    Trot-trot to the mottled foot-hills, cedar-mottled and pinon;
    Did you ever see an otter?
    Silvery-sided, fish-fanged, fierce-faced whiskered, mottled.

    When I trot my little pony through the aspen-trees of the canyon,
    Behold me trotting at ease betwixt the slopes of the golden
    Great and glistening-feathered legs of the hawk of Horus;
    The golden hawk of Horus
    Astride above me.

    But under the pines
    I go slowly
    As under the hairy belly of a great black bear.

    Glad to emerge and look back
    On the yellow, pointed aspen-trees laid one on another like feathers,
    Feather over feather on the breast of the great and golden
    Hawk as I say of Horus.

    Pleased to be out in the sage and the pine fish-dotted foothills,
    Past the otter's whiskers,
    On to the fur of the wolf-pelt that strews the plain.

    And then to look back to the rounded sides of the squatting Rockies,
    Tigress brindled with aspen
    Jaguar-splashed, puma-yellow, leopard-livid slopes of America.

    Make big eyes, little pony
    At all these skins of wild beasts;
    They won't hurt you.

    Fangs and claws and talons and beaks and hawk-eyes
    Are nerveless just now.
    So be easy.





SPIRITS SUMMONED WEST


    England seems full of graves to me,
    Full of graves.

    Women I loved and cherished, like my mother;
    Yet I had to tell them to die.

    England seems covered with graves to me,
    Women's graves.

    Women who were gentle
    And who loved me
    And whom I loved
    And told to die.

    Women with the beautiful eyes of the old days,
    Belief in love, and sorrow of such belief.
    _Hush, my love, then, hush._
    _Hush, and die, my dear!_

    Women of the older generation, who knew
    The full doom of loving and not being able to take back.
    Who understood at last what it was to be told to die.

    Now that the graves are made, and covered;
    Now that in England pansies and such-like grow on the graves of women;
    Now that in England is silence, where before was a moving of soft-skirted
        women,
    Women with eyes that were gentle in olden belief in love;
    Now then that all their yearning is hushed, and covered over with earth.

    England seems like one grave to me.

    And I, I sit on this high American desert
    With dark-wrapped Rocky Mountains motionless squatting around in a ring,
    Remembering I told them to die, to sink into the grave in England,
    The gentle-kneed women.

    So now I whisper: _Come away,_
    _Come away from the place of graves, come west,_
    _Women,_
    _Women whom I loved and told to die._

    _Come back to me now,_
    _Now the divided yearning is over;_
    _Now you are husbandless indeed, no more husband to cherish like a child_
    _And wrestle with for the prize of perfect love._
    _No more children to launch in a world you mistrust._
    _Now you need know in part_
    _No longer, or carry the burden of a man on your heart,_
    _Or the burden of Man writ large._

    _Now you are disemburdened of Man and a man_
    _Come back to me._
    _Now you are free of the toils of a would-be-perfect love_
    _Come to me and be still._

    Come back then, you who were wives and mothers
    And always virgins
    Overlooked.

    Come back then, mother, my love, whom I told to die.
    It was only I who saw the virgin you
    That had no home.

    The overlooked virgin,
    My love.

    You overlooked her too.

    Now that the grave is made of mother and wife,
    Now that the grave is made and lidded over with turf.

    _Come, delicate, overlooked virgin, come back to me_
    _And be still,_
    _Be glad._

    I didn't tell you to die, for nothing.
    I wanted the virgin you to be home at last
    In my heart.

    Inside my innermost heart,
    Where the virgin in woman comes home to a man.

    The homeless virgin
    Who never in all her life could find the way home
    To that difficult innermost place in a man.

    _Now come west, come home,_
    _Women I've loved for gentleness,_
    _For the virginal you._
    _Find the way now that you never could find in life,_
    _So I told you to die._

    Virginal first and last
    Is woman.
    _Now at this last, my love, my many a love,_
    _You whom I loved for gentleness,_
    _Come home to me._

    They are many, and I loved them, shall always love them,
    And they know it,
    The virgins.
    And my heart is glad to have them at last.

    Now that the wife and mother and mistress is buried in earth,
    In English earth,
    _Come home to me, my love, my loves, my many loves,_
    _Come west to me_.

    For virgins are not exclusive of virgins
    As wives are of wives;
    And motherhood is jealous,
    But in virginity jealousy does not enter.





THE AMERICAN EAGLE


    The dove of Liberty sat on an egg
    And hatched another eagle.

    But didn't disown the bird.

    _Down with all eagles!_ cooed the Dove.
    And down all eagles began to flutter, reeling from their perches:
    Eagles with two heads, eagles with one, presently eagles with none
    Fell from the hooks and were dead.

    Till the American Eagle was the only eagle left in the world.

    Then it began to fidget, shifting from one leg to the other,
    Trying to look like a pelican,
    And plucking out of his plumage a few loose feathers to feather the nests
        of all
    The new naked little republics come into the world.

    But the feathers were, comparatively, a mere flea-bite.
    And the bub-eagle that Liberty had hatched was growing a startling big bird
    On the roof of the world;
    A bit awkward, and with a funny squawk in his voice,
    His mother Liberty trying always to teach him to coo
    And him always ending with a yawp
    _Coo! Coo! Coo! Coo-ark! Coo-ark! Quark!! Quark!!_
    YAWP!!!

    So he clears his throat, the young Cock-eagle!

    Now if the lilies of France lick Solomon in all his glory;
    And the leopard cannot change his spots;
    Nor the British lion his appetite;
    Neither can a young Cock-eagle sit simpering
    With an olive-sprig in his mouth.

    It's not his nature.

    The big bird of the Amerindian being the eagle,
    Red Men still stick themselves over with bits of his fluff,
    And feel absolutely IT.

    So better make up your mind, American Eagle,
    Whether you're a sucking dove, _Roo -- coo -- ooo! Quark! Yawp!!_
    Or a pelican
    Handing out a few loose golden breast-feathers, at moulting time;
    Or a sort of prosperity-gander
    Fathering endless ten-dollar golden eggs.

    Or whether it actually is an eagle you are,
    With a Roman nose
    And claws not made to shake hands with,
    And a Me-Almighty eye.

    The new Proud Republic
    Based on the mystery of pride.
    Overweening men, full of power of life, commanding a teeming obedience.

    Eagle of the Rockies, bird of men that are masters,
    Lifting the rabbit-blood of the myriads up into something splendid,
    Leaving a few bones;
    Opening great wings in the face of the sheep-faced ewe
    Who is losing her lamb,
    Drinking a little blood, and loosing another royalty unto the world.

    Is that you, American Eagle?

    Or are you the goose that lays the golden egg?
    Which is just a stone to anyone asking for meat.
    And are you going to go on for ever
    Laying that golden egg,
    That addled golden egg?


Out of the Flame
Osbert Sitwell

  TWO MEXICAN PIECES

SONG


  How jolly are the dwarfs, the little ones, the Mexicans
  Hidden by the singing of wind through sugar-cane,
  Out comes the pretty one,
  Out comes the ugly one,
  Out comes the dwarf with the wicked smile and thin.

  The little women caper and simper and flutter fans,
  The little men laugh, stamp, strut and stamp again,
  Dance to the bag-pipe drone,
  Of insect semitone,
  Swelling from ground slashed with light like zebra skin.

  The little Cardinal, the humming-bird, whose feathers flare
  Like flame across the valley of volcanic stone,
  Fiery arrow from a rainbow
  That the armoured plants have slain, low
  Stoops to watch the dwarfs as they dance out of sight.

  Hair, long and black as jet, is floating yet on amber air
  Honey-shaded by the shadow of Popacatapetl's cone,
  Their fluttering reboses
  Like purple-petal'd roses
  Fall through tropic din with a clatter of light.

  The crooked dwarf now ripples the strings of a mandoline,
  His floating voice has wings that brush us like a butterfly;
  Music fills the mountains
  With a riot of fountains
  That spray back on the hot plain like a waterfall.

  Smaller grow the dwarfs, singing I'll bring shoes of satin,
  Smaller they grow, fade to golden motes, then die.
  Where is the pretty one,
  Where is the ugly one,
  Where is that tongue of flame, the little Cardinal?




 MAXIXE

  The Mexican dwarfs can dance for miles
  Stamping their feet and scattering smiles,
  Till the loud hills laugh and laugh again
  At the dancing dwarfs in the golden plain,
  Till the bamboos sing as the dwarfs dance by,
  Kicking their feet at a jagged sky,
  That torn by leaves and gashed by hills
  Rocks to the rhythm the hot sun shrills;
  The bubble sun stretches shadows that pass
  To noiseless jumping-jacks of glass,
  So long and thin, so silent and opaque,
  That the lions shake their orange manes, and quake;
  And a shadow that leaps over Popacatapetl
  Terrifies the tigers as they settle
  Cat-like limbs, cut with golden bars,
  Under bowers of flowers that shimmer like stars.
  Buzzing of insects flutters above,
  Shaking the rich trees' treasure-trove
  Till the fruit rushes down like a comet, whose tail
  Thrashes the night with its golden flail,
  The fruit hisses down with a plump from its tree
  Like the singing of a rainbow as it dips into the sea.
  Loud red trumpets of great blossoms blare
  Triumphantly like heralds who blow a fanfare,
  Till the humming-bird, bearing heaven on its wing,
  Flies from the terrible blossoming,
  And the humble honey-bee is frightened by the fine
  Honey that is heavy like money and purple like wine,
  While birds that flaunt their pinions like pennons
  Shriek from their trees of oranges and lemons,
  And the scent rises up in a cloud, to make
  The hairy, swinging monkeys feel so weak
  That they each throw down a bitten coconut or mango.

  * * * * *

  Up flames a flamingo over the fandango,
  Glowing like a fire, and gleaming like a ruby.
  From Guadalajara to Guadalupe
  It flies -- in flying drops a feather
  ... And the snatching dwarfs stop dancing -- and fight together.




  OUT OF THE FLAME



  From my high window,
  From my high window in a southern city,
  I peep through the slits of the shutters,
  Whose steps of light
  Span darkness like a ladder.
  Throwing wide the shutters
  I let the streets into the silent room
  With sudden clatter;
  Walk out upon the balcony
  Whose curving irons are bent
  Like bows about to shoot -- 
  Bows from which the mortal arrows
  Cast from dark eyes, dark-lashed
  And shadowed by mantillas,
  Shall in the evening
  Rain down upon men's hearts
  Paraded here, in southern climes,
  More openly.
  But, at this early moment of the day,
  The balconies are empty;
  Only the sun, still drowsy-fingered,
  Plucks, pizzicato, at the rails,
  Draws out of them faint music
  Of rain-washed air,
  Or, when each bell lolls out its idiot tongue,
  When Time lets drop his cruel scythe,
  They sing in sympathy.
  The sun, then, plucks these irons,
  As far below,
  That child
  Draws his stick along the railings.
  The sound of it brings my eye down to him....
  Oh heart, dry heart,
  It is yourself again!
  How nearly are we come together!
  If, at this moment,
  One long ribbon was unfurled
  From me to him,
  I should be shown
  Above, in a straight line -- 
  A logical growth,
  And yet,
      I wave, but he will not look up;
      I call, but he will not answer.



  From where I stand
  The beauty of the early morning
  Suffocates me;
  It is as if fingers closed round my heart.
  The light flows down the hills in rivulets,
  So you could gather it up in the cup of your hands,
  While pools,
  The cold eyes of the gods,
  Are cradled in those hollows.
  Cool are the clouds,
  Anchored in the heaven;
  Green as ice are they,
  To temper the heat in the valleys
  With arches of violet shadow.
  You can hear from the distant woods
  The thud of the centaurs' hoofs
  As they gallop down to drink,
  Shatter the golden roofs
  Of the trees, for swift as the wind
  They gallop down to the brink
  Of the waters that echo their laughter,
  Cavernous as rolling of boulders down hills;
  Lolling, they lap at the gurgling waters.

  * * * * *

  But nearer rises the sound,
  Red, ragged as his comb,
  Of a cock crowing;
  A bird flies up to me at the window,
  Leaping, like music, with regular rhythm,
  Sinks down, then, to the city beneath.



  Below, the ants are hurrying down the footways,
  Dressed, here, in bright colours.
  Under their various intolerable burdens
  They stagger along.
  Stop to converse, move, wave their antennae.

  * * * * *

  The fruit-seller is opening his stall,
  Oranges are piled in minute pyramids,
  While melons, green melons,
  Swing from the roof in string cradles.
  The butcher festoons his shop
  With swags and gay wreaths of entrails;
  Beautiful heads with horns,
  Are nailed up, as on pagan altars,
  (Though their ears are fresh from the hearing
  Of Orpheus playing his lute).

  The Aguador arranges his glasses,
  Out of which the sun will strike
  His varying scales of crystal music
  This afternoon, round the arena.
  The Matador prepares for the fight,
  Is, indeed, already in the Tavern,
  Where later and refreshed with blood,
  He will celebrate his triumph
  Among the poignant kindling
  Of string d instruments.

  * * * * *

  -- But the child has run away crying;
  I call -- but no answer comes.


  The chatter of the daylight grows
  As I look upon the market-place,
  Where there is a droning of bag-pipes,
  And the hard, wooden music of the hills;
  The housewife has left her cottage in the forest,
  Driving here through the early tracks of the sun.
  The beggars are already at their posts,
  Their dry flesh peeps through their garments.
  Their old ritual whining
  Causes no show of pity.
  Why should the hucksters, the busy people notice?
  God himself has stood here, out at elbows,
  Waiting patiently in the market-place,
  While they chatter in gay booths.
  But how I fear for them,
  These who are not afraid!
  I shout to them to make them understand.
  They talk more, cease talking and look up,
  They all look up, remain gaping.

  * * * * *

  I went back into the water-cool room,
  Put on my coloured coat, my buskin,
  And mask of Harlequin.
  They see me, this time.
  Come on, come on, they cry,
  You are just in time.
  There is fun down here in the market-place.
  Two men have been run over,
  And there's to be a public execution.
  The gallows are nearly up.
  -- And after, in the evening,
  We will go round the wineshops,
  Strumming guitars,
  While trills Dolores in her wide, red skirt.
  Oh come on, come on!
  -- But the paint from my mask runs down
  And dyes my clothing.




  It is not thus in the Northern cities,
  Where the cold breathes close to the window-pane,
  Where the brittle flowers of the frost
  Crackle at the window's edge.
  From my window in the Northern city
  I can hear the rattle and roar of the town,
  As the carts go lumbering over the bridges,
  As the men in dark clothes hurry over the bridges.
  They do not parade their hearts here,
  They bury them at their lives' beginning.
  They must hurry, or they will be late for their work;
  Their work is their bread.
  Without bread, how can they work?
  They have no time for pleasure,
  Nor is work any pleasure to them.
  Their faces are masked with weariness,
  Drab with their working.
  (Only the tramp who moves among them
  Unnoticed, despised,
  Has eyes that have seen).
  They must work till the guns go again,
  Giving them their only pretence to glory.
  They have no time to fear,
  No time to think of an end.
  Foolishly I called to them on the bridges;
  Only a few stopped, looked up
  -- But these were convulsed with fury.
  Said one to another
  I have never seen a man
  Behave like that before.
  But most of them were mute,
  And could not see.

  * * * * *

  Through the murkiness of the Northern dawn,
  The gas already flares out
  In the glass palaces,
  Where to-night, weary and dulled with smoke and with drink,
  They will seek, in a brief oblivion,
  Laughter, and the mask of Ally Sloper.

  * * * * *

  Thus it is in the Northern cities,
  Where the cold lies close to the window-pane,
  Where the grass grows its little blades of steel
  And the wind is armed with seven whips.



  Happy is Orpheus as he plays,
  The dumb beasts listen quietly,
  The music strokes their downy ears,
  Melts the fierce fire within.

  Only with music can you tame the beasts,
  Break them of their grizzly feasts;
  Only with music can you open eyes to wonder.
  But if they will not hear?
  The people have lost faith in music,
  Few are there to call, and none to answer.

  * * * * *

  When the Prince kissed the Sleeping Beauty,
  He broke the wicked spell of cobwebs;
  She answered, opened her eyes.

  When Narcissus looked into the pool,
  The cruel waters gave him their reply
  -- Even that was a better fate
  Than to cry out in the lonely night
  -- And not to be answered.



  From my high window in a Southern city,
  Floating above the geometrical array
  Of roofs, squares and interlacing streets,
  One can see beyond
  Into far valleys,
  That seem at first
  To be open blue flowers
  Scattered here and there on the mountains.
  The forests are so far away,
  They creep like humble green moss
  Over slopes that are mountains.
  And there sounds other music
  Than the falling streams,
  Or the deep penetrating glow
  Of sunlight piercing through green leaves.




  When Orpheus with his wind-swift fingers
  Ripples the strings that gleam like rain,
  The wheeling birds fly up and sing,
  Hither, thither, echoing.
  There is a crackling of dry twigs,
  A sweeping of leaves along the ground.
  Tawny faces and dumb eyes
  Peer through the fluttering green screens,
  That mask ferocious teeth and claws
  Now tranquil.
  As the music sighs upon the hills,
  The young ones hear,
  Come skipping, ambling, rolling down,
  Their soft ears flapping as they run,
  Their fleecy coats catching in the thickets,
  Till they lie, listening, round his feet.

  * * * * *

  Unseen for centuries,
  Fabulous creatures creep out of their caverns.
  The unicorn
  Prances down from his bed of leaves,
  His milk-white muzzle still stained green
  With the munching, crunching of mountain herbs.
  The griffin usually so fierce,
  Now tame and amiable again -- 
  Has covered the white bones in his secret cavern
  With a rustling pall of dank, dead leaves,
  While the Salamander -- true lover of art -- 
  Flickers, and creeps out of the flame;
  Gently now, and away he goes,
  Kindles his proud and blazing track
  Across the forest
  -- Lies listening,
  Cools his fever in this flowing water.

  * * * * *

  When the housewife returns,
  Carrying her basket,
  She will not understand.
  She misses nothing,
  Has heard nothing in the woods.
  She will only see
  That the fire is dead,
  The grate cold.

  * * * * *

  But the child left in the empty house
  Saw the Salamandar in the flame,
  Heard a strange wind, like music, in the forest,
  And has gone out to look for it,
  Alone.




  TWO DANCES

COUNTRY DANCE

  The Lion and the Unicorn
    Dance now together,
  There in the golden corn -- 
    For it is summer weather.

  The Lion, seen between the sheaves,
    Is more strong than fair,
  Yet he lets the singing thieves
    Rustle through his tawny hair.

  As he treads, the red-gold grain
    Curtsies and bows down;
  The birds tear at his ruffled mane,
    Stealing seed to feed Troy Town.

  For famine, in that fabled land,
    Grows, as the years pass.
  (Is it golden grain or sand
    From a broken hour-glass?)

  Night comes; over azure ground
    Roves an argent breeze:
  The Unicorn can still be found
    Trampling down the fleur-de-lys.

  Elegant and moon-white
    As a ghost, the Unicorn
  Dances for his own delight
    Under the flowering thorn.

  While deep in the sleeping wood
    The Lion breathes heavily,
  Though every dove in each tree coo'd,
    Yet would he sleep on wearily.

  * * * * *

  The Unicorn and Lion strong
    Dance now together
  (But surely they did no wrong -- 
    For it was the summer weather?)

  In among the red-gold grain,
    Ankle-deep in the Lilies of France -- 
  And I, for one, could scarce refrain
    From joining that heraldic dance.



FOX TROT

  WHEN SOLOMON MET THE QUEEN OF SHEBA

  The navy at Ezion-Geba
  Gazed across the water amazed;
  When Solomon met the Queen of Sheba
  Lions in the desert were dazed
  With wonder at her striped pavilion
  That blazed like a new parhelion;
  They roared their admiration
  At this strange coruscation
    Till the satyrs
              Took their tawny children
                      Trampling through the sand
  To march with the procession, to march with the band.
  The flaming phoenix flew with its feathers to fan
  The Queen at the head of her caravan;
  But, the phoenix, though famously fabulous,
  Was jealous, envious, and emulous
      For the Queen of Sheba had a retinue
      Strictly in keeping with her revenue -- 
  Six thousand camels and camelopards
  Ten thousand and ninety nigger bodyguards.
  The camelopards, proud-necked and tall
  Would scarcely deign to notice the Queen at all,
  But holding their heads as high as zebras
  Looked down on a hundred dwarf, harnessed zebras
  Bred for their stripes, with such success
  That the Queen could play a game of chess
  When travelling.  The camels kneel
  Offer their humps for the Queen to feel,
  Nodding arched-necks and plumes of ostrich-feather,
  Dyed like her bright Abyssinian weather.
  The ten thousand niggers beat on gourds and golden gongs,
  Slashing the air with their piebald songs.

  * * * * *

  Thus the Queen met the King of Jerusalem
  And he
          Seemed wiser
                      Than Methuselem,
  With a great black beard,
                      And a nose like a scythe,
  He lived in the palace,
                      And subsisted on a tithe!
      He gave the Queen of Sheba a welcome;
      Proportionate to her income;
  But this amazing Amazon
  Was lovable, generous and free.
  She brought a gift to Solomon of cinnamon,
  With an Almug and a Nutmeg tree -- 
      These he placed before his palace
      For the pleased
                  Admiration
                          Of the populace.
  Each sweet-smelling branch bore a budding bell of gold
  (Oh! the blood of Israelites ran cold...)
  When evening-wind blurred the hills with blue
  The swinging and the singing of the bells sang true,
  These by some magic stratagem
  Played the Sheban National Anthem,
  While the trill of each bell was like an Abyssinian bird,
  Or the golden voice of the Queen -- for each word
  She spoke, trembled, sparkled in the air,
  Then spread its wings, and flew from her.
      But the Queen of Sheba went with Solomon
      To his country house at Lebanon.

  She did not bring him any cedar trees
  For these
          Would have been de-trop.
  Instead she brought him some Pekoe-trees
  In a beautiful Chinese bowl
  (For she had a very marked objection to
  Endowing Newcastle with coal)
  And she brought him gifts of hot-house grapes,
  Of ivory,
          Of ebony,
                  Of elephants and apes,
  Of peacocks, of pearls, and a hundred pygmy slaves
  With skins like an orange, and hair that waves,
  And each of them wore a turban,
  Picked out with the plumes of a pelican,
  But of all her gifts, by far the rarest,
  Brought from the terrible central forest,
  With a vein of gold in its ivory horn,
  Was a lovelorn
          Milk-white unicorn;
      But the King, though sweet as honey,
      Had an eye for the value of money,
  So he only gave her a heraldic lion
  Embossed with the arms (and nose) of Zion.

  * * * * *

      Though the Queen of Sheba loved Solomon
      She was not happy at Lebanon,
  It was not the woman of the Edomites,
  The Zidonians,
              The Moabites,
                      The Hittites,
                              or the Ammonites!
  She would even listen to his proverbs, she put up with
      very many wrongs -- 
  But in secretly reading his notebook, she found Solomon's
      Song-of-Songs
  She knew it at once -- it was poetry!  And she left The
      Palace that day,
  But Solomon knew not where she went to nor why she had
      roamed away!
        But every evening in Jerusalem
        The Almug and the Nutmeg trees
        Flaunt the Sheban National Anthem
        Like a banner on the spice-laden breeze.
  And oh! each golden bell
            Seemed a turtle-dove
                            That coo'd
  Within the moonlit shadow
            Of an Abyssinian wood....

  * * * * *

  But we wonder what she looked like -- this fascinating
        phantasmagoria....
  Atalanta, Gioconda, Semiramis -- or the late Queen Victoria?




  TWO GARDEN PIECES

NEPTUNE IN CHAINS

  Enslaved are the old Gods;
  Pan pipes soundlessly
  For the unheeding bees.

  Bound by the trailing tresses of the vine
  To soft captivity,
  Neptune has left his waves
  To stand beneath the frozen, green cascades
  Of summer trees.

  Is the Sea-God, then, content to rule
  The rippling of wayward flowers,
  Lulled by the songs that many birds pour out
  From their green-cradles, gently-rocked
  -- Songs that foam like hissing rain
  Among the heavy blossoms?
  Can he control
  The music of the wind through poplar trees,
  -- Those trees, an instrument
  That any wind, however young
  Or drunk with drowsing scent
  Of petals, crushed by the flaming fingers of the sun
  Can play upon?

  But darkness, the deliverer
  Comes with dreams.
  Night's grape-stained waves
  Cool his aching body -- 
  The song of the nightingale
  Falls round him
  Like the froth of little waves;
  The warm touch of the evening wind
  Thaws the green cascades
  Till you can hear
  Every liquid sound within the world
  -- Fountains, falling waterfalls,
  And the low murmur of the rolling sea
  -- And Neptune dreams that he is free.

FOUNTAINS

  Proud fountains, wave your plumes,
  Spread out your phoenix-wing,
  Let the tired trees rejoice
  Beneath your blossoming
  (Tired trees, you whisper low).

  High up, high up, above
  These green and drooping sails,
  A fluttering young wind
  Hovers and dives -- but fails
  To steal a foaming feather.

  Sail, like a crystal ship,
  Above your sea of glass;
  Then, with your quickening touch,
  Transmute the things that pass
  (Come down, cool wind, come down).

  All humble things proclaim,
  Within your magic net,
  Their kinship to the Gods.
  More strange and lovely yet
  All lovely things become.

  Dead, sculptured stone assumes
  The life from which it came;
  The kingfisher is now
  A moving tongue of flame,
  A blue, live tongue of flame -- 

  While birds, less proud of wing,
  Crouch, in wind-ruffled shade,
  Hide shyly, then pour out,
  Their jealous serenade;
  ... Close now your golden wings!




  PARADE

  While vapour rises, the sun shines along
  A promenade beneath tall trees.  In vain
  Seek thirsting flowers to thread their crystal song
  Upon the liquid harpstrings of the rain.

  Sweet air is honey'd with the lulling sound
  Of bees, gold-dusted.  In the avenue
  Each leaf is now a lens the sun has found
  To focus light, and cast green shadow through

  Where walks Zenobia.  Her marmoset
  Perched on the shoulder, grabs at ribbon'd flowers
  Or youthful curls of elders.  Etiquette
  Is outraged, and a dowager glowers.

  The Marmoset plays with Zenobia's curls,
  Clutches the papillon's enamel'd sail;
  Gesticulates with idiot hands; unfurls,
  Then counts, the piebald rings upon his tail.

  Here flutter fan and feather to and fro
  As eager birds caressing golden sheaves;
  And like the spray of fountains, when winds blow
  The froth of laughter foams among the leaves,

  Till music, thin as silver wire, uncoils
  -- Metallic trap to trip unwary players -- 
  A tune, ringed like the monkey's tail; but foils
  Any attempt to straighten it -- In layers

  The idlers pause to watch the stage, where leap
  These masked buffoons to which the Old Gods sank.
  Over her fan Zenobia may peep
  At the lewd gestures of a mountebank.

  The silent lime-trees drip their golden scent;
  Staccato shrills the puppet, waves a wand,
  Postures, exaggerates a sentiment....
  The little ape, alone, may understand

  How men make Gods, and place them up above;
  Then clamber up themselves to throw God down,
  Dearly pay deities for former love;
  We hold them captive, make them play the clown.

  Who knows but that, one day, men may be bound
  Thus to make war or love for apeish laughter,
  Until the world of gibbering monkeys round
  Quiver with laughter at our ape-like slaughter?

  * * * * *

  Ends song and antic; players quit the stage
  To the gloved silence of genteel applause,
  Splutters El Capitan in Spanish rage,
  Curses his money.  Swathed in quiet, like gauze,

  The World is still, until a breeze sets free
  Green leaves, with plucking sound of mandoline.
  Convulsed the monkey capers -- seems to see
  The wind, that wing d God and Harlequin.

  Who, flying down, sounds waters' silver strings
  And brings soft music from far trembling towers,
  Snatches a bird-bright feather for his wings
  And flickers light on many secret flowers.




  ENGLISH GOTHIC

  Above the valley floats a fleet
  Of white, small clouds.  Like castanets
  The corn-crakes clack; down in the street
  Old ladies air their canine pets.

  The bells boom out with grumbling tone
  To warn the people of the place
  That soon they'll find, before His Throne,
  Their Maker, with a frowning face.

  * * * * *

  The souls of bishops, shut in stone
  By masons, rest in quietude
  As flies in amber.  They atone
  Each buzzing long-dead platitude.

  For lichen plants its golden flush
  Here, where the gaiter should have bent;
  With glossy wings the black crows brush
  Carved mitres, caw in merriment.

  Wings blacker than a verger's hat
  Beat on the air.  These birds must learn
  Their preaching note by pecking at
  The lips of those who, treading fern,

  Ascend the steps to Heaven's height.
  -- The willow herb, down by the wood,
  Flares out to mark the phoenix-flight
  Of God Apollo's car.  Its hood

  Singes the trees.  The swans who float
  -- Wings whiter than the foam of sea -- 
  Up the episcopal smooth moat,
  Uncurl their necks to ring for tea.

  * * * * *

  At this sign, in the plump green close,
  The Deans say grace.  A hair pomade
  Scents faded air.  But still outside
  Stone bishops scale a stone fa ade.

  A thousand strong, church-bound, they look
  Across shrill meadows -- but to find
  The cricket bat defeats the Book
  -- Matter triumphant over Mind!

  Wellington said Waterloo
  Was won upon the playing-fields,
  Which thought might comfort clergy who
  Admire the virtues that rank yields.

  But prelates of stone cannot relate
  An Iron Duke's strong and silent words.
  The knights in armour rest in state
  Within, and grasp their marble swords.

  Above, where flutter angel-wings
  Caught in the organ's rolling loom,
  Hang in the air, like jugglers' rings,
  Dim quatrefoils of coloured gloom.

  Tall arches rise to imitate
  The jaws of Jonah's whale.  Up flows
  The chant.  Thin spinsters sibilate
  Beneath a full-blown Gothic rose.

  Pillars surge upward, break in spray
  Upon the high and fretted roof;
  But children scream outside -- betray
  The urging of a cloven hoof.

  * * * * *

  Tier above tier the Bishops stare
  Away, away, ... above the hills;
  Their faded eyes repel the glare
  Of dying sun, till sunset fills

  Each pointed niche, in which they stand,
  With glory of earth; humanity
  Is spurned by one, with upturned hand,
  Who warns them all is vanity.

  The swan beneath the sunset arch
  Expands his wings, as if to fly.
  A thousand saints upon the march
  Glow in the water, ... but to die.

  A man upon the hill can hear
  The organ.  Echoes he has found
  That, having lost religious fear,
  Are pagan; till the rushing sound

  Clearly denotes Apollo's car,
  That roars past moat and bridge and tree,
  The Young God sighs.  How far, how far,
  Before the night shall set him free?




  THE BACKWARD CHILD

  Asleep, asleep with clos d eyes
  In the womb of time, King Pharaoh lies;
  Heavy the darkness is, as rust,
  On the cold sword he holds; while dust
  Muffles the mocking panoply
  With quilted silence, dead and grey.
  Here any wandering sound would skim
  The sleep off silence, to wake him
  Till under the too-smooth mask of gold
  Old parchment wrinkles would unfold,
  His green and ice-bound limbs expand,
  The dead flowers blossom in dead hand;
  But comes no sound, save the flitting scowl
  Of death-winged bat, or vault-voiced owl,
  No sound through the ages all forlorn,
  Unless a padding unicorn
  Obscures his treasure, ivory white,
  In the Egyptian grape-blue night;
  Curling his limbs to rest, untangles
  His milky mane, while moon-sharp angles
  Of pyramids enfold him close
  In their defiant, calm repose -- 
  For their harsh angularity
  Defeats the hunter's cruelty....

  * * * * *

  No padding unicorn is this
  To prick the Old King's nothingness,
  Yet a movement woke, a faint sound stirred
  The silence, like a spoken word
  No soft night sound, nor anything
  But rolling laughter echoing.

  * * * * *

  Then King Pharaoh stretched, stood up, with a smile
  Touched the crowns of the Upper and Lower Nile.
  Like the jewels in his crown, had grown more deep
  His gypsy eyes in embalm d sleep,
  While out of the golden sockets came
  A very living, curious flame.
  He dashed the gold mask on the floor,
  His dry limbs creaked toward the door,
  And out of it thrust his nodding head,
  A pendulum to count the dead,
  -- For there below in the lion-coloured sand
  Salome danced the Sarabande!

  * * * * *

  With ruffled plumage, the sun flashed its wing
  On a double-crowned, parchment-yellow king.
  The clear bronze sides of the pyramids
  Shone like polished coffin-lids,
  Each side a huge triangular mirror
  To magnify each separate terror,
  To heighten the shadows, to enhance
  How dead was the king, how alive the dance,
  Till ashamed the wicked echoes hid
  Like bats in the depth of the pyramid,
  Or hid far-off in the honey-comb hive
  Of caves, where the bearded hermits live.

  * * * * *

  Serapion-the-Sidonite
  Turned from the strange unholy sight.
  Left his cave, went up the hill
  Where aged Anthony dwells still.
  Disturbed in prayer, St. Anthony,
  Looks round, recalls a century;
  Yet in that whole tempestuous age
  Had beheld never such a mirage
  (Not even when with book and bell
  He cleansed the hill he loves so well
  -- That hill of Venusberg, whose name
  The poor vile heathen still proclaim)
  Led by two Bishops, with his high crook,
  The old saint summons round his flock.
  They, hour by hour, together read
  The paternoster and the creed,
  While Christian choirs of shrill-birds bless
  The Saint's white-bearded holiness.

  * * * * *

  Below the heathen nightingales,
  Embalm, within their seven veils
  Of song, Salome -- swathings fine
  Scented with fountain, rose and vine -- 
  Tired Pharaoh falls back in his box;
  The lid snaps down.  The golden flocks
  Of stars browse round the singing trees
  And orchards of Hesperides.
  Down here no sound, except forlorn
  Sad padding of the unicorn
  Who seeks a refuge from the snare
  Of cruel hunters; lurking here
  His horn, his mane, his shape are hid
  In slumber of the pyramid.
  Safe here is he; for in this place
  Hide every legendary race;

  Saints, satyrs, unicorns, entrance
  Us with their fabulous elegance;
  And Pharaoh himself sits up to tea
  Under the shade of the incense tree
  Yet nomads, wandering, will find
  No tree, no murmur, no soft wind!




  NURSERY RHYME

  THE ROCKING-HORSE

  Gentle hills hold on their lap
  Cloud-rippled meadows where tall trees sigh.
  The round pool catches in her lap
  Greenness of tree and breadth of sky.

  The mottled thrush that sings, serene,
  Of English worm in English lane,
  Is left behind.  We change the scene
  For jungle or for rolling plain.

  I rock the children, carry them
  On wooden waves that creak like me,
  From Joppa to Jerusalem
  Or to a far Cerulean sea,

  Where flutter winds that bear the balm
  And breathing of a million flowers
  That nod beneath a feathery palm;
  Where dusky figures, in cool bowers

  Of fretted coral, singing, swim
  -- Forget the missionary who wishes
  To make them chant a British hymn
  And hide their nakedness from fishes.

  * * * * *

  Within the limits of this stride
  I can encompass any space;
  Time's painted gates are open wide,
  The Old Gods give me their embrace.

  Now off to Babylon we trot
  To see the hanging gardens, where
  Tree, trailing vine and mossy grot
  Show proudly in the upper air

  Above the shifting evening throng,
  Like giant galleons with full sails;
  These streams have robbed their crystal song
  From honey-throated nightingales.

  We've watched the Roman legions pass
  -- The Tower of Babel, waver ... fall;
  We've stroked the wooden horse that was
  The hidden breach in great Troy's wall.

  Softly the rainbow Pantaloon,
  Slinks down night's alley.  (Oh! how still is
  The evening on this wide lagoon,
  Where palaces like water-lilies

  Float palely in the trembling peace
  Of stars and little waves.)  Sails past
  Jason, who stole the golden fleece
  To nail it high above his mast....

  .... In Toad-stool Farm we're back again;
  See how the fat and dappled cow
  Crouches in buttercups; come rain,
  To make the green lush meadows grow!




  TWO MYTHOLOGICAL POEMS

THE JEALOUS GODDESS

  Silenus left the mainland
  On a floating barrel of wine,
  His sail was plaited from peach-leaves, and
  The leaves of the fig and vine.
  Small waves seemed masks of laughter
  As they rose at Silenus agape,
  For his feet were purple with the slaughter
  And the crushing of the Phoenix-blooded grape.
  But the little golden winds of the autumn
  Flew with him all the way,
  Like a fleecy flock of Seraphim
  They waited on him all the day -- 
  When the Syren swam to sing to him
  From her island where the dolphins play,
  They pelted her with lemons and with persimmon
  Till the Syren dived away.
  They blew down silver trumpets to summon
  Sea-monsters that peer from the spray.

  But the sound of seraphic hunting-horn
  Brayed to the nearing golden strand,
  Till each ogre, dragon, giant and unicorn
  Sprang from his cave, to guard his land
  -- This dear, dear land of Venus
  Where the hippogriff and griffin play!
  For if the Syren sang to Silenus
  What would Jealous Venus say?


BACCHANALIA


  Where little waves claw the golden grapes,
  Springing at the terraced hills like lions,
  Where pirates swagger in earrings and black-capes
  And the roses and the lilies grow like dandelions,
  Silenus, I regret to say, sat
  On an empty, purple vat,
  (And his life-long love, the Lady Venus
  Had left for Olympus, shocked at Silenus).

  The Syren's voice, like a golden bee,
  Trembles through the leaves of each lemon tree,
  Winging, like a bird, from her island grove
  It brought Silenus a message of love;
  But, as, rather helpless, he heard the Syren's song
  He felt that his behaviour was material -- was wrong,
  He tore the tinted vine-leaves from his tousled hair
  Shouted for his satellites, dragged them from their lair,
  Mentioned, most severely, the iniquities of drink
  (Though his speech came thick and indistinct);
  But his followers were angry, woken out of sleep,
  Recalled to him that the sea was deep,
  That if it was water he really would prefer,
  And the singing of the Syren, he could go to look for her!
  But, Silenus, though pink and fat,
  Was strong, for the matter of that...
  He fought like a lion, and bellowed like a seal,
  But he had filled his followers with missionary zeal,
  They swung him high, and swung him low,
  Then threw him (plomp) where the salt waves blow.
  The syren stopped her singing at a piteous cry,
  Saw a spout of water mounting hundreds of feet high,
  And Jonah aboard a neighbouring sail,
  Sang Yo-ho, yo-ho, I spy a whale!


  SING PRAISES

  SATIRES




  EXPLANATION

  SUBTLETY OF THE SERPENT



  Through the green masses of the undergrowth,
  Pools of silent water,
  Where float large flowers and patches of white light,
  Crawls the serpent, subtle, sad,
  And tired of well-doing.
  Nevermore will he help humanity.
  Venomously he hisses at the Cherubim
  Whose flaming sword sears the Heavens,
  A sword whose flame turns every way
  To keep the path of the Tree-of-Life.
  A tropic spring, this first one,
  With leaves like spears and banners;
  But the ground is sweet with fallen petals
  Of great blossoms
  That heave their hot breath at the droning insects.
  The air is full of the twittering of birds,
  Whose innocence appeals to Adam
  -- Already outside the garden -- 
  While, high up in their swaying green cradles
  The monkeys carry on their high-pitched chatter.

      The serpent reasoned thus -- 
  For long time have I been at war
  With the ape-tribe;
  Small apes with clutching hands,
  Great apes (how hideous they are!)
  Whom the God-of-Man
  Has made in the image of Man.
  They tried to kill me:
  I tried to kill them.
  But Adam and Eve deceived me,
  Looking scornfully at the great apes,
  They pretended to a difference.
  For a long time I loved them,
  Fascinated by their words,
  By their story of the Creation -- 
  But now, O Lord,
  Give me a good old-fashioned ape
  Every time
  -- An ape who tries to kill me
  Without a chatter of clean-hands, law-and-order,
  Crime passionel,
  Self-defence or helping-me-to-help-myself.
  I may be a snake in the grass,
  But I am not a hypocrite.
  I may change my skin,
  But I am not ashamed of it.
  I have never pretended to be a super-snake
  Or to walk except on my belly -- 

  * * * * *

  It is not only the ignorance of good or evil
  That raises the monkey above the man
  (Though the man knows evil and therefore prefers it),
  But the fact that the monkey
  Cannot yet disguise the good with bad words,
  Or the bad with good ones.

  * * * * *

  Never before have I been cursed;
  But man has made his God
  Curse me with black words.
  Now, therefore,
  Will I curse Mankind.
      -- Man shall know good, but shall not act on it.
      He shall know good, and turn it to evil purpose.
      His twin curses shall be words and knowledge;
      I, the snake, know a thing-or-two;
      I know that man is a self-made monkey,
      -- And he knows it too!
      But he will disguise it
      With a God of his making,
      A blustering God, a revengeful God,
      A God who curses the Serpent
      With sophistry, subtlety, and -- words.
      But I know that Man is still
      An ape at heart,
      A talkative chattering ape.
      His curiosity shall discover many strange secrets,
      But he will use them
      For his two recreations,
      Lying and killing,
      Or -- as he calls them -- 
      Conversation and Sport.
      His words shall girdle a continent
      Swiftly, as a flash of fire;
      They shall be written down,
      Every day,
      For millions of men to read
      -- But they will still be lies -- black lies!
      Men shall journey the world over
      To kill the beasts of the field, the forest and jungle;
      He shall kill them secretly, without their knowing
      As with a thunder-bolt:
      But his own kind
      Will he kill in millions,
      Slaughter and butcher
      With the last refinements of torture.
      -- And words, words,
      Shall be the cause and end of it.

  As the serpent crawled away on his belly
  Through the silent waters of the undergrowth,
  He heard two sharp voices,
  Outside the garden.
    You did -- I didn't.
    You did -- I didn't.
             -- It was the serpent.

  A long silence, and then the second act,
  When the brutal voice of the first statesman
  Roared out
  Am I my brother's keeper?




  DE LUXE


  MRS. FREUDENTHAL CONSULTS THE WITCH OF ENDOR

  A nose, however aquiline,
  Escapes detection in a throng;
  So she hopes; but sense of sin
  Made her shrink and steal along

  Streets glazed by mocking summer heat
  To semblance of a cool canal,
  Where iridescent insects beat
  Their wings upon the liquid wall,

  Where radiant insects, carrion-fed,
  Buzz and flutter busily,
  Smile, or frown, or nod the head,
  Expressing some familiar lie.

  Enter the house, ascend the stair!
  Consult the scintillating ball;
  Beatrice Freudenthal, beware!
  Eve felt like you before the Fall.

  Within the shining mystic globe,
  Lies luck at bridge, or martyr's crown;
  A modern prophetess will probe
  The future -- for one guinea down.

  For that amount the future's sword
  From crystal scabbard she will drag;
  She can unpack the future's hoard,
  As we unpack a Gladstone bag.

  Without the agency of Man,
  Solely by fasting and by prayer,
  The wizards of Old Jenghiz Khan
  Could move a wine cup through the air

  Until it reached him; then he drank,
  Fermented juice of rye or grape;
  The cup flew back, his courtiers shrank
  Away, astonished and agape.

  Before the Lama turns to grapple
  With State-Affairs, he learns to spin
  (Despite Sir Isaac Newton's apple),
  In mid-air, sixty times -- to win

  Amusement mixed with approbation
  From sceptical ambassadors,
  For any kind of levitation
  Increases prestige with the Powers!

  Such things were practised -- did not tend
  To promote war or anarchy
  -- Yet now such things would even end
  A Constitutional Monarchy.




  NIGHT THOUGHTS

  Magic for a holy race
  Is surely wrong?  How strictly hidden
  The future, in its crystal case,
  Lies packed -- so near and yet forbidden!

  Though Gentile Kings upon their thrones
  May weave a spell, or dance like Tich,
  Yet ponder on the bleaching bones
  Of Saul, who sought the Endor Witch.

  Now Mrs. Freudenthal has heard her call
  Without a qualm -- yet how can she obey
  The bidding of the prophetess (like Saul,
  She has consulted Endor)?  How can she

  Aspire to feed the lions, yet unlike Daniel,
  Once there insist on resting in their den,
  To treat them as one would a King Charles Spaniel
  With frowns -- with bones and biscuits, now and then?

  For Mrs. Freudenthal is weary of
  Her auction-bridge and hissing hotel-friend,
  Seeks spheres where Novelist and Romanoff
  Eat with Artistic Ladies without end.

  Money is power -- a golden pedestal
  Atones for beauty that is long, long dead -- 
  As Orpheus, Mrs. Kinfoot has enchanted all,
  The lions who have not thundered -- and then fled.

  Thus climbing sideways, you entice a throng
  Of Artists with a biscuit and a bone -- 
  Then use them as a bait, step up a rung -- 
  But how begin?  At night she plans alone

  Within the saxe-blue hotel drawing-room,
  The silence of South Kensington is deep,
  No sound except the traffic's wave-like boom
  -- And Mrs. Kinfoot climbing in her sleep!

  Thus Mrs. Freudenthal, alone, awake,
  And sad, broods on.  Oh how, oh how begin?
  Till suddenly she melts -- as small waves break,
  So laughter ripples to her fortieth chin.

  For now she has it -- clasps the golden key
  That shall unbar that stranger -- Popularity.
  How many noses are forgiven thee,
  Forgotten, in the name of Charity?

  First fill the coffers of the Sacred Cause,
  And then the stomachs of the well-to-do,
  Now Mrs. F. ... will be their Santa Klaus
  -- Until herself becomes a War-horse too.




  THE WAR-HORSE CHANTS

  Was there war once,
  I have forgotten it!
  Was there war once?
  -- War means more trade.

  Poor Lady X
  Has given up her motor-car,
  Poor Lady Y
  Has shut up her house.

  Was there war once?
  I have forgotten it.
  Was there war once?
  -- Now food is here.

  Now I remember
  How much I suffered -- 
  Very bad form
  To mention the war.

  Such dreadful suffering
  Injures my appetite -- 
  All these brave men
  Dying for me -- 

  Was there war once?
  Yes, I remember it.
  Was there ... was once...?




  A TOUCH OF NATURE

  Trained to a charm of manner, to a smile
  -- Enamelled and embalmed by Madame Rose
  (Shame that an artist of this skill, this style,
  Can never sign her work), no War-Horse shows

  Any emotion.  The poor Spartan Youth
  Though the fox gnawed his entrails, would not cry;
  These never wince, nor hurl the mirror at Truth,
  Though Old Age disembowel them secretly.

  Throughout the day, blue shadows in the valley
  Hover, crouch down, till dusk will let them rend
  The last light on the hills; so wrinkles rally
  To overwhelm them at their sudden end -- 

  For Death strikes at the Old as well as Young,
  And these -- and these -- may die at balls or races,
  Or living death may make them loll the tongue,
  Twitching in doll-like, hideous grimaces.

  The very dab of rouge, that ghastly shred
  Of self-respect, makes worse the look so winning
  Of eyes -- dead eyes -- that know quite well they're dead -- 
  And yet retain a certain childish cunning.

  And each day till the end, is dragged along
  This painted bundle, trundled in its tomb,
  Toward the sea where wondering children throng,
  Mocked by this mask, this nodding lisp of doom

  That almost apes them -- save the open eye
  Which contradicts the mouth, and knows the matter,
  This terrible eye that moans I die, I die,
  While the poor slobbering mouth can only chatter.

  Then other War-horses pause, nod, go past,
  -- A few months younger these -- and laugh together -- 
  (She, too, was hard and bold), nor note how fast
  An egret's wing becomes a funeral feather.

  They laugh and mutter, make their little jokes,
  -- And wonder if her lover had been bored
  Look at the poor old thing!
              The dumb voice chokes;
  The eye is open yet -- each word a sword!




  YOUTH AT THE PROW, AND PLEASURE AT THE HELM

  Battista Sforza, led by unicorns,
  Triumphant, ever set in amber light
  By Piero, yet keeps her course; adorns
  Her empty palace, still, that floating height

  Where Raphael was born -- Isotta's name,
  Near-by, still, rose-like, clambers through the gloom
  Of Malatesta's temple, built to fame
  His pagan love, half pleasure-house, half tomb.

  Then, even tyrants drunk with blood and pride,
  And ever vaunting poison-cup and knife,
  No less than angels beauty made; they died,
  But Art, their pleasure, still extols their life.

  Thus power, thus gold, sought pleasure in the past
  But wooed her strangely, in a different mood
  -- As Pallas or Minerva -- things that last,
  Carved both in mind and heart, in stone and wood.

  Now many palaces and Tuscan towns
  Crumble upon a half-deserted hill,
  Slowly their stone surrenders to the flowers;
  The drip and flowing of their fountains fill

  The night with cool -- the night that is alive
  With chanting frog and owl and nightingale;
  Who knows but that these things may yet contrive
  To please, when tank and war-memorial fail?

  Gonzaga, D'Este, Medici are gone,
  Or dreary sons approach their unnoticed fall,
  Top-hatted, leave a beauty-hating throne
  To fawn upon a Mrs. Freudenthal,

  Or find their pleasure at a football match
  -- Express a dullard similarity
  To other ox-eyes -- lifting up the latch
  Upon a similar vulgarity.

  For pleasure, too, is old; has lost her realm,
  -- Degraded to a mumbling hag -- for now
  Stands Golf -- for pleasure -- at an armoured helm,
  The Cenotaph -- for Youth -- at iron prow!

  Yet never cruelty reaped such vast reward
  As in these latter days, and with such ease,
  When the whole world became a slaughter-yard
  And stank with crime, and reeked with foul disease.

  -- No crime of passion -- only crime for gold,
  Or crimes of rulers drunk with their stupidity;
  The people walk with faces deathly cold,
  Or marked and masked with their cupidity.

  But Mrs. Freudenthal knows her own mind,
  And means to follow up and win the game,
  Seek pleasure with the others of her kind,
  Who live and die alike, and share the same

  Ideals.  A horse has focussed in its eyes
  Exaggerated visions of its rider,
  So Mrs. Freudenthal now magnifies
  A War-horse's importance -- like a spider

  She weaves her web, while brain and heart both burn
  To join their ranks, to rally to their banner;
  Beside the feeding of them, she must learn
  To ape the face, the smile, the talk, the manner!




  THE MANNER

  Allow no personality to stamp
  Its wayward lines upon your talk or dress;
  Smooth out your facial furrows, on them clamp
  The necessary look of nothingness.

  You must acquire a careful conversation
  Remember that War-horses of True Breed
  Only feel interest -- if ever -- in relation
  To other ones -- and, never, never read!

  Know though the names of authors, and conceivably
  The names of their most fashionable book;
  But never talk too far, or irretrievably
  You blunder on the crafty fisher's hook.

  Then music, as a rule, you love too well
  To wish to hear.  But if you go, you walk
  About -- if not too loud, it helps to swell
  The frankly social impulse toward talk.

  You simply love the Opera, and force
  Your way in late, and romp from cage to cage;
  The prima-donna is a well-known War-horse
  Who fills the heart, the ear, the house, the stage!

  If you see modern pictures, in their glass
  Ecstatically examine the old strife
  Between your food and figure -- should he pass,
  Discuss with friends the painter's private life.

  Though, safety-first, you find it really best
  To cast your rapture on the gilded air,
  When you find pictures dead, but smartly drest,
  Within the mansion of a millionaire.

  Still you encourage those whom you can hire
  To fix on canvas, for the future race
  Of War-horses to simper at -- admire,
  The painted image of your painted face.

  And any artist, author, or musician,
  -- If second-rate -- is useful as a bait
  To fish for guests -- remember words like Titian
  -- Shakespeare -- Mozart, let go -- and trust to Fate

  To pull you through -- avoid ideas -- they're common
  And might crack through the varnish of your smile,
  Impinge upon your worship of God Mammon
  Filling your soul with pity, and things vile.




  THE OPEN DOOR

  A light, within her glassy car, betrays
  Folding of chins beneath the aquilinity
  Of heavy curling features, and displays
  A likeness to Assyrian Divinity.

  When comes the dusk, life's cloak is thrown aside;
  The yellow windows shout their nakedness...
  Until again the weary buildings hide
  Their throb and stir with usual drab blackness.

  So, now, swooped darkness down; outside, each lamp
  Showed the raw-fingers of the winter night
  Clutching squat horses, torn by dirt and damp,
  Like mouldering cardboard boxes; each small light

  Within, exposed a section harsh and shrill
  Of life, cut off as the next scene succeeded
  -- A broken chair, a figure standing still,
  A withered plant -- mean drama that, unheeded,

  Flashes its image on the world's dark screen
  But for a moment -- yet the play goes on,
  Vibrates through worlds -- to mingle in a scene
  Of final war or crime, or revolution;

  But though finite to us, this act of blood
  Is meaningless, when flashed on outer dark
  Of whirling planets, though a curious God
  Might for the moment, notice a vague mark.

  Again we make God in the image of Man
  -- Imagine God has made us in His image -- 
  Reigns Law-and-Order for another span
  To crush the weak in mad ferocious rage.

  The wise, poor tight-rope dancers, walk again
  The thin-drawn wire of art and thought, out-thrust
  A hand to catch the comet's golden rain,
  Whose blossom fades within their arms to dust.

  Can man be falling once more through the black
   ons of hunger, ignorance and shame?
  -- But Mrs. Freudenthal pursues her track,
  Intent upon it, means to win the game.

  Houses rush past her -- but she does not see,
  Her eyes are glazed, until with clarity
  She notes the War-horses drawn up for tea
  Outside the glittering home of Charity.

  Upstairs, bedecked with plumes, their minds they rest
  On music and on muffins -- all for sake
  Of Charity; the music gives a zest
  To whispered conversation -- if awake,

  Yet silent, the unwelcome harmony
  May cause the facial scaffolding to fall;
  They lower safety-curtains o'er each eye,
  And move uneasily within each stall,

  For music has a strange, unwelcome power
  Of smearing sentiment about the mouth
  Like children, after eating jam, they glower
  In heavy, stupefaction -- cross, uncouth.

  The car arrives, the open door,
  Expels a scorching flood of light -- 
  The noise outside dies down -- the floor
  Is slippery and very bright.




  INTRODUCING

  It takes a camel thirty days
  To cross the sinister sand of Lop
  Whose Bedouin chants Allah's praise
  Without cessation, dare not stop.

  Though unaware of the subtle danger
  Of buried learning, of civilisation,
  He feels himself on his guard -- a stranger
  With Ignorance as his true Salvation.

  Unknown to him beneath the extent
  Of ashen sand, old Gods lie hidden
  With frozen gesture, ears intent
  On sounds forgotten and forbidden.

  -- For muttering of muted bell
  Swells music from the nightingales
  Whose crystal gurglings excel
  The singing streams that formed these vales

  So fruitfully luxuriant still
  To eyes closed like a curving sword
  -- Though now no sound save droning thrill
  Of shifting sand is ever heard.

  Yet of an influence here felt
  Tradition tells the Bedouin.
  Into grey sand the mirages melt.
  Spell the Arab's road to ruin.

  On through the dusk he hears his name
  Called, then repeated -- seek he must
  That voice which calls, like wealth or fame
  Only to lead from dust to dust;

  Or death may come through the burning night
  With the drumming of a multitude,
  For the Devil revels in the sight
  Of death in the desert solitude.

  Though the camel can kneel, he never prays
  Careless if God or Devil is near,
  Stoutly he bears his burden of days
  With Seven Stomachs -- and no fear.

  Yet Infant Samuel in the Old Priest's house
  When darkness drowned him with its shadowy torrent
  Felt fear at hearing his own name (who knows
  But that he changed it after -- by Royal Warrant?)

  Mrs. Freudenthal, irate,
  Decides to diet, to get thin.
  Everyone must deprecate
  Decay of manners.  With no chin

  The arrogant yet gluttonous camel
  Never shows satiety;
  Would rather rest in asphodel
  Than figure in Society,

  But Mrs. Kinfoot, spotting a new head
  To add to her collection -- grasps her hand,
  And Mrs. Freudenthal is gently led
  Within the portals of the Promised Land.




  MALGR  SOI

  The voices weave a web of futile sound;
  A fan is dropped by Lady Carabas;
  Restored to her: but Mrs. Kinfoot frowned,
  Guarding the door, as Cerberus his pass,

  But suddenly, great waves of sound obtrude
  Upon the pleasant party in this room;
  While we enjoy the music's interlude,
  Outside there swells the trumpet-call of doom.

  Mosaic tombs or unmarked graves -- asunder
  Are rent.  King Dodon rises from the dead
  And while the quivering heavens thunder,
  He smooths his robe, then calmly shakes his head

  Free of the ages' dust -- but now the voices
  Of these condemned (for judgment will not tarry)
  Shrill out in woe; but one, alone, rejoices,
  For Mrs. Kinfoot scents another quarry.

  The Army of the Dead are on the march
  To meet their Maker on his ivory throne;
  He sits beneath the rainbow's radiant arch,
  Dispensing judgment.  Oh! atone, atone!

  But Mrs. Kinfoot saw a sailor-sinner 
  -- With one arm -- leave St. Paul's and walk away
  And Mrs. Kinfoot longed to give a dinner
  To meet the Judge upon the Judgment day!



  Above God's head a dozen suns kept guard
  Like sentinels.  Her erring feet were led
  Up to a crowded mount, where God's regard
  Was fixed upon her, while He gravely said:

  Anne Kinfoot, worthy mother, and good wife,
  Your weakness and your faults are all forgiven;
  Go you, my child, to everlasting life,
  And take your husband, also, up to Heaven.

  But she could see the Counsellors and Kings
  And brilliant bearers of a famous name,
  Tangled with snakes and horrid crawling things
  Sent down to torture and eternal flame.

  Then Mrs. Kinfoot lied in agony: Oh, Lord,
  I am as others of my class and station,
  She cried, Oh, have me bound, and burnt and gored
  Oh! send me down to suffer my damnation.

  I swear I beat my children!  Oh, despondent
  She was; I am a sinner.  I will tell
  How I escaped a Ducal Co-respondent
  Last year -- my God -- I must insist on -- Hell.

  But the Great Judge was not deceived -- He knew
  The worthy virtue of the Kinfoot line;
  Yet as she went to Heaven, constant, true
  To principle, she murmured, Will you dine

  To meet... but dragged away, she dwells on high
  And notes, but rather disapproves the eccentricity
  Of Saints and Early Christians, who try
  To lessen the burden of her domesticity.

  She has to play upon a golden harp,
  Join in the chorus of the heavenly choir;
  Her answers to the Saints are sometimes sharp,
  She longs to singe her wings, and share the fire.

  Night never comes, so when she tries to flee
  To that perpetual party down below,
  The angels catch her, shouting out with glee,
  Dear Mrs. Kinfoot -- you are good! ---- We know!




  PARADISE REGAINED

  Poor Mrs. Kinfoot closed her wings, leant out
  From the Gold Bar of Heaven,
  Shed tears, like icicles, to flout
  Hell's suffering, to leaven

  The Torment of the Upper Ten -- 
  -- Or was it because now and then

  She heard the glad hilarious cries,
  (A party down below again)
  Till tears formed in her jungle-eyes
  For torture she could not attain?

  Or heard the strains that she adored
  -- Not martyrs seeking the Lost Chord

  As here, nor Heber's hints of ire -- 
  But Russian Music, for the latter
  Was sent down to eternal fire
  To promote fashionable chatter,

  Which, as on earth, when music sounds
  E'en torture cannot keep in bounds.

  And Jacob's ladder, as she leans
  Invites escape; with deep delight
  She recollects what climbing means!
  -- But angels guard her day and night,

  Or rather day and day, because
  Eternal glory never thaws

  To dusk -- again strange music blares
  Its strangled message through all space,
  While, lit by multi-coloured flares,
  Hell's blackness gains a certain grace.

  * * * * *

  Oh, Heaven is dull, cried Mrs. Kinfoot, dull!
  -- And then the Gold Bar snap'd
            -- And like a bull

  She charged the universe full-tilt.  The roseate domes
  The golden minarets, the opal towers
  Of Heaven speed above, while hot wind foams
  About her, seems to wither them like flowers.

  Old Jacob climbing up his Freudian stair
  Bowed down with age -- is taken unaware,

  Slithers, then falls -- but, like a shooting-star,
  Falls Mrs. Kinfoot past him.  As she spins,
  Hell's legions stop to watch her, though still far
  Away, chant gladly Mrs. Kinfoot wins!

  Can you consign to everlasting flame
  The Woman who beats Jacob at his game?

  And oh! the people, oh! the parties here!
  Musician, Author, Artist, Aristocrat!
  Dear Lady Carabas, with Mr. Queer;
  The Cosmopolitan Marquise, with that

  Old Duchess of St. Dodo, whose tiara
  Is made of snakes and scorpions -- they are a

  Present from the Devil, whose assistance
  She claimed on earth -- Himself now welcomes in
  The new arrival, saying For Persistence
  You have no equal, so, though free from Sin,

  We here create you Honorary Member,
  Beginning from the Fifth day of November,

  (A Saint's day here).  Now authors and Debrett
  Mingle their laughing tears to music's swell,
  For here are some whom she has never met
  -- And Mrs. Kinfoot finds her Heaven in Hell!




  FIVE PORTRAITS AND A GROUP

THE GENERAL'S WIFE REFUSES

  It isn't that I don't like them,
  My dear Mrs. Kinfoot,
  But I know
  I am not clever,
  And I like your old friends best.

  As for the General
  He disapproves of Art,
  And does not believe in it.
  He has noticed
  That Artists
  Have an odd look in their eyes,
  And a shifty expression.
  In fact,
  The General disapproves of Art.

  He finds that Artists
  Are stupid
  And difficult to talk to -- 
  He remembers meeting one
  In '97
  Who was not interested
  In Polo,
  -- And appeared
  To be unaware of the existence
  Of the old Duke of Cambridge.

  My husband didn't get angry,
  He just said to him, like that,
  What are you interested in?
  _ART_, I suppose?

  In spite of this
  The General thinks
  That music is more dangerous
  -- And subversive of discipline
  Than painting -- 
  For -- in painting -- 
  That is to say
  In good painting -- 
  You can see put down on canvas
  What you can see yourself -- 
  -- And you can touch it
  With your finger -- 
  A picture should be the same
  As a coloured photograph,
  Except that the camera
  Reveals things
  Invisible to the Human Eye;
  That is wrong!
  (By the Human Eye
  The General says
  He means
  His own eye)
  But in Music
  You can see nothing,
  And you are unable
  To touch it
  With your fingers;
  The General disapproves of Art,
  -- But it makes him positively nervous
  To hear music.

  The General says that,
  As far as he can make out,
  All musicians
  Have been German -- 
  But he can only remember
  The name of one -- 
  Nietzsche!
  As the war
  Was German in origin,
  It is obvious that it was made
  By German Composers
  And _not_
  By German Generals
  -- Many of whom were fine fellows
  Who loved a good joke.
  The General remembers one
  Who laughed like anything
  At one of his stories.
  The war was made by German musicians
  -- Just as surely
  As our own
  Pacific and imaginative policy
  Was interpreted
  By Kipling and Lady Butler.

  Never trust a Man
  Who plays the piano,
  The General says.
  He thinks that
  In the main,
  The British have a sound interest
  In this matter.
  Probably Charles I,
  Played the piano -- 
  And, at any rate,
  He collected Pictures.

  The English would never
  Behead anyone
  For governing badly;
  It is only Barbarians,
  Like the Russians,
  Who would do this.
  The General
  Disapproves of Art.

  But, of all these things,
  The General says
  He dislikes poetry most,
  Kipling is different;
  He is a Man-of-the-World.
  But the General says
  That if he got hold
  Of one of these long-haired
  Conscientious Objectors,
  Who write things
  Which don't even rhyme
  He'd---- 
    So you see, dear,
  That it's better for us
  Not to come.



AUX BORDS DE LA MER

  Where frightened woolly clouds, like sheep
  Scurry across blue skies; where sleep
  Sings from the little waves that reach
  In strict formation to the beach,
  Are houses -- covers of red-plush,
  To hide our thoughts in, lest we blush.

  * * * * *

  Here live kind ladies -- hence they come
  To persecute us -- I am dumb
  When they give from wide saucer-eye
  Intolerable sympathy,
  Or testify solicitude,
  By platitude on platitude,
  Mix Law-and-Order, Church-and-State
  With little tales of Bishop Tait,
  Or harass my afflicted soul
  With most fantastic rigmarole
  Of Bolshevik and Pope in league
  With Jewish and Sinn-Fein intrigue -- 
  I love to watch them, as they troop
  Revolving, through each circus-hoop
  Of new-laid eggs -- left at the door -- 
  With Patriotism -- for the Poor -- 
  Of ball-committee, Church Bazaar,
  All leading up to a great war,
  A new great war -- greater by far
  -- Oh! much more great -- than any war.

  Kind lady, leave me, go enthral
  The pauper-ward, and hospital!



 GIARDINO PUBBLICO

  Petunias in mass formation,
  An angry rose, a hard carnation,
  Hot yellow grass, a yellow palm
  Rising, giraffe-like, into calm
  -- All these glare hotly in the sun.
  Behind are woods, where shadows run
  Like water through the dripping shade
  That leaves and laughing wind have made.
  Here silence, like a silver bird,
  Pecks at the fruit-ripe heat.  We heard
  Townward, the voices, glazed with starch,
  Of Tourists on belated march
  From church to church, to praise by rule
  The beauties of the Tuscan school,
  Clanging of trams, a hidden flute,
  Sharp as the taste of unripe fruit;
  Street organs join with tolling bell
  To threaten us with both Heaven and Hell,
  But through all taps a nearing sound
  As of stage-horses pawing ground.
  Then like a whale, confined in cage,
  (In grandeur of a borrowed carriage)
  The old Marchesa swam in sight
  In tinkling jet that caught the light,
  Making the sun hit out each tone
  As if it played a xylophone,
  Till she seems like a rainbow, where
  She swells, and whale-like, spouts the air.

  * * * * *

  And as she drove, she imposed her will
  Upon all things both live and still;
  Lovers hid quickly -- none withstood
  That awful glance of widowhood;
  Each child, each tree, the shrilling heat
  Became encased in glacial jet,
  The very songbird in the air
  Became a scarecrow, dangling there,
  While, if you turned to stare, you knew
  The punishment Lot's wife went through.

  * * * * *

  Her crystal cage moves on.  Stagnation
  Now thaws again to animation;
  Gladly the world receives reprieve
  Till six o'clock to-morrow eve,
  When punctual as the sun, she'll drive
  Life out of everything alive,
  Then in gigantic glory, fade
  Sunward, through the western glade....


ULTIMATE JUDGMENT

  Within the sunny greenness of the close,
  Secure, a heavy breathing fell, then rose -- 
  Here undulating chins sway to and fro,
  As heavy blossoms do; the cheek's faint glow
  Points to post-prandial port.  The willow weeps
  Hushed are the birds -- in fact -- the Bishop sleeps.

  Then, suddenly, the wide sky blazes red;
  Up from their graves arise the solemn dead,
  The world is shaken; buildings fall in twain,
  Exulting hills shout loud, then shout again
  While, with the thunder of deep rolling drums
  The angels sing ----  At last Salvation comes.
  The weak, the humble, the disdained, the poor
  Are judged the first, and climb to Heaven's door.

  * * * * * *

  The Bishop wakes to see his palace crash
  Down on the rocking ground -- but in a flash
  It dawns upon him; -- with impressive frown,
  He sees his second-housemaid in a crown,
  In rainbow robes that glisten like a prism
  I warned them... said the Bishop -- 
      Bolshevism!



AN OLD-FASHIONED SPORTSMAN

  We thank thee,
  O Lord,
  That the War is over.
  We can now
  Turn our attention
  Again
  To money-making.
  Railway-Shares must go up;
  Wages must come down;
  Smoke shall come out
  Of the chimneys of the North,
  And we will manufacture battle-ships.
  We thank thee, O Lord,
  But we must refuse
  To consider
  Music, Painting, or Poetry.

  Our sons and brothers
  Went forth to fight,
  To kill certain things,
  Cubism, Futurism and Vers-libre
  All this Poetry-and-Rubbish,
  We said
  Will not stand the test of war.
  We will not read a book
  -- Unless it is a best seller.
  There has been enough art
  In the past,
  Life is concerned
  With killing and maiming.
  If they cannot kill men
  Why can't they kill animals?

  There is still
  Big Game in Africa
  -- Or there might be trouble
  Among the natives.
  We thank thee, O Lord,
  But we will not read poetry.

  But as the Pharisees
  Approached the tomb
  They saw the boulder
  Rolled back,
  And that the tomb was empty
  -- They said
  It's very disconcerting.
  I am not at all
  Narrow-minded.
  I know a tune
  When I hear one,
  And I know
  What I like -- 
  I did not so much mind
  That He blasphemed
  Saying that He was the Son-of-God,
  But He was never
  What I call
  A Sportsman;
  He went out into the desert
  For forty days
  -- And never shot anything
  And when He hoped He would drown
  He walked on the water.

  ... No -- we will not read poetry.




  THE GROUP

  ENGLISH TEA-ROOMS

  Why do they sit in darkness,
  Hiss like geese?
  Outside the sun flashes his strong wings
  Against the green-slit shutters,
  Through which you can see
  Him bathing in the street.
  Like a bird he preens himself at the windows,
  Then dances back with the swimming flash of a gold-fish.
  Why do you hiss like geese,
  What do you hide,
  With your thin sibilance of genteel speech?

  * * * * *

  The Colonel, usually a rollicking character,
  In the manner of El Capitano,
  Simpers, like any schoolgirl.
  Miss Vera complains that her brother
  Is suffering from catarrh.
  On the other hand
  Hotel-life is easier than home-life,
  She just rings the bell,
  Orders anything she wants,
  -- And there it is -- punctual to the minute.
  Both Sir William and his daughter
  Are pleased with their holiday;
  Admire the flora and the fauna;
  Miss Ishmael sketches, and the place abounds
  In peasants, picturesque old-bit-and-corner -- 

  * * * * *

  If they should die...
  Say only this of them,
  That there's a corner in some foreign field
  That is for ever England...
  They travel; yet all foreign things
  Are barr'd and bolted out of range
  ... While England benefits by the exchange.




  SUNDAY AFTERNOON

  The gilt-fring'd earth has sadly spun
  A sector of its lucent arc
  About the disillusioned sun
  Of Autumn.  The bright angry spark

  Of Heaven in each upturned eye
  Denotes religious ecstasy.

  We, too, have spun our Sunday round
  Of Church and beef and after-sleep
  In houses where obtrudes no sound
  But breathing, regular and deep,

  Till Sabbath sentiment, well-fed,
  Demands a visit to the Dead.

  For Autumn leaves sad thoughts beget,
  As from life's tree they clatter down,
  And Death has caught some in her net
  Even on Sunday, -- in this Town,

  Tho' money and food and sleep are sweet!
  The dead leaves rattle down the street.

  Fat bodies, silk-enmeshed, inflate
  Their way along; if Death comes soon
  They'll leave this food-sweet earth to float
  Heavenward, like some huge balloon.

  Religion dims each vacant eye
  As we approach the cemet'ry.

  Proudly we walk; with care we bend
  To lead our children by the hand,
  Here, where all, rich and poor, must end
  -- This portal to a better land

  To which -- if in good business -- 
  We have hereditary access;

  Where to afford the Saints relief
  From prayer and from religious questions,
  Round after round of deathless beef
  Flatters celestial digestions;

  Where, in white robe, with golden crown,
  We watch our enemies sent down,

  To other spheres, while we lean out,
  Divinest pity in our eyes,
  And wonder why these sinners flout
  Our kindly pitying surprise,

  Why look so angry when we play
  On gold harps as they go away,

  A hymn tune, dear, familiar?
  But now we stand within the space
  Where marble females drape a tear
  Above a whisker'd marble face.

  Isn't it pretty?  Even now
  Rich and exotic blossoms grow

  About each granite monument
  Of men frock-coated, unaware
  Of Judgment; what emolument
  Requites a weeping willow's care?

  Look!  Over there a broken column
  Is watched by one geranium,

  Whose scorching scarlet tones uphold
  Damnation and eternal fire
  To those who will not reckon gold -- 
  Who are not worthy of their hire,

  For marble tombs are prized above
  Such brittle things as thought or love.

  The crystal web of dusk now clings
  From evergreen to tropic tree,
  Toss'd by the wind that subtly brings
  A mingled scent of mould and tea

  That causes silence to be rent
  By one scream -- childish, but intent.

  For children will not realise
  That they should rest without a sound
  With folded hands and downcast eyes
  Here, in the Saint's Recruiting Ground.

  And so, in sorrow, we turn back
  To hasten on our high-tea track.

  But after, in the night, we dream
  Of Heaven as a marbled bank,
  In which, in one continual stream,
  We give our gold for heavenly rank,

  Where each Saint, standing like a sentry,
  Explains a mystic double-entry.

  The Director of the Bank is God -- 
  Stares our foes coldly in the face,
  But gives us quite a friendly nod,
  And beckons us to share His place.




  CORPSE DAY


  Dusk floated up from the earth beneath,
  Held in the arms of the evening wind
  -- The evening wind that softly creeps
  Along the jasper-terraces,
  To bear with it
  The old, sad scent
  Of midsummer, of trees and flowers
  Whose bell-shaped blossoms, shaken, torn
  By the rough fingers of the day
  Ring out their frail and honeyed notes.

  * * * * *

  Up from the earth there rose
  Sounds of great triumph and rejoicing.

  Our Lord Jesus, the Son of Man,
  Smiled
  And leant over the ramparts of Heaven.
  Beneath Him
  Through the welling clouds of darkness
  He could see
  The swarming of mighty crowds.
  It was in the Christian Continent,
  Especially,
  That the people chanted
  Hymns and paeans of joy.
  But it seemed to Our Lord
  That through the noisy cries of triumph
  He could still detect
  A bitter sobbing
  -- The continuous weeping of widows and children
  Which had haunted Him for so long,
  Though He saw only
  The bonfires,
  The arches of triumph,
  The processions,
  And the fireworks
  That soared up
  Through the darkening sky,
  To fall in showers of flame
  Upon the citadel of Heaven.
  As a rocket burst,
  There fell from it,
  Screaming in horror,
  Hundreds of men
  Twisted into the likeness of animals
  -- Writhing men
  Without feet,
  Without legs,
  Without arms,
  Without faces....

  The earth-cities still rejoiced.
  Old, fat men leant out to cheer
  From bone-built palaces.
  Gold flowed like blood
  Through the streets;
  Crowds became drunk
  On liquor distilled from corpses.
  And peering down
  The Son of Man looked into the world;
  He saw
  That within the churches and the temples
  His image had been set up;
  But, from time to time,
  Through twenty centuries,
  The priests had touched up the countenance
  So as to make war more easy
  Or intimidate the people -- 
  Until now the face
  Had become the face of Moloch!
  The people did not notice
  The change
      ... But Jesus wept!

PROLOGUE


    In sudden cloud that blotting distance out
    Confused the compass of the traveller's mind,
    Biassed his course, three times from the hill's crest
    Trying to descend but with no track to follow,
    Nor visible landmark -- three times he had struck
    The same sedged pool of steaming desolation,
    The same black monolith rearing up before it.
    This third time then he paused to recognize
    The _Witches' Cauldron_ only known before
    By hearsay, fly-like on whose rim he had crawled
    Three times and three times dipped to climb again
    Its uncouth sides, so to go crawling on.

    By falls of scree, moss-mantled slippery rock,
    Wet bracken, drunken gurgling watercourses,
    He escaped limping at last, and broke the circuit
    Travelling down and down; but smooth descent
    Interrupted by new lakes and ridges,
    Sprawling unmortared walls of boulder granite,
    Marshes; one arm hung bruised where he had fallen,
    Blood welled a sticky trickle from his cheek,
    Mist gathering in his eye-brows ran full beads
    Down to his eyes, making them smart and blur.

    At last he blundered on some shepherd's hut -- 
    He thought, the hut took pity and appeared -- 
    With mounds of peat and welcome track of wheels
    Which he now followed to a broad green road
    Running from right to left; but still at fault
    Whether he stood this side or that of the hill,
    The mist being still on all, with little pause
    He chose the easier way, the downward way.
    Legs were dog-tired already, only the road,
    The slow descent with some relief of guidance
    Maintained his shambling five miles to the hour
    Coloured with day dreams. Then a finger post
    Broke through the mist, pointing into his face,
    But when he stopped to read gave him no comfort.
    SEVENTEEN MILES TO -- somewhere, God knows what!
    The paint was weathered to a mere acrostic
    Which cold unfocussed eyes could never read -- 
    But jerking a derisive thumb behind it
    Up a rough stream-wet path "THE WITCHES' CAULDRON
    ONE MILE." Only a mile
    For two good hours of stumbling steeplechase!
    There was a dead snake by some humorous hand
    Twined on the pointing finger; far away
    A bull roared hoarsely, but all else was mist.

    Then anger came upon him, in which heat
    He fell into deep thought and rhymes came strung
    Faster than speech might have kept pace with them.
    The Snake, the Bull!
                        What laughter was it, ended
    His allegory and startled the graceful hare
    That secure in the mist came leaping down towards him?
    Witch in disguise, emissary of witches?
    Swiftly he takes a stone up, hurls it at her,
    Chases her, bawling childish angry threats;
    She screams. Now with red shame sorrow floods back
    Making his journey by twice three miles longer
    As though once revisiting the witches,
    Those unclean -- it stood symbol in his mind
    For what, but what? He never wished her harm -- 
    She being a hare and having innocent eyes -- 
    It was her fault for blundering on him there.
    He never wished her harm, she should have known
    His angry fit, frustration, weariness
    Breaking a gentler mood. With slackening steps
    He once more takes the homeward road, that is,
    If it does lead home; it's making uphill now
    And narrowing sadly. That fool finger-post
    Had only snakes to brag about and witches,
    And the bull roared no very helpful threat.




THE FEATHER BED


    "Goodbye, but now forget all that we were
    Or said, or did to each other, here's goodbye.
    Send no more letters now, only forget
    We ever met...." and the letter maunders on
    In the unformed uncompromising hand
    That witnesses against her, yet provides
    Extenuation and a grudging praise.
    Rachel to be a nun! Postulate now
    For her noviciate in a red brick convent:
    Praying, studying, wearing uniform,
    She serves the times of a tyrannic bell,
    Rising to praise God in the early hours
    With atmosphere of filters and stone stairs,
    Distemper, crucifixes and red drugget,
    Dusty hot-water pipes, a legacy-library....

    Sleep never comes to me so tired as now
    Leg-chafed and footsore with my mind in a blaze
    Troubling this problem over, vexing whether
    To beat Love down with ridicule or instead
    To disregard new soundings and still keep
    The old course by the uncorrected chart,
    (The faithful lover, his unchanging heart)
    Rachel, before goodbye
    Obscures you in your sulky resignation
    Come now and stand out clear in mind's eye
    Giving account of what you were to me
    And what I was to you and how and why,
    Saying after me, if you can say it, "I loved."

    Rachel so summoned answers thoughtfully
    But painfully, turning away her head,
    "I lived and thought I loved, for I had gifts
    Of most misleading, more than usual beauty,
    Dark hair, grey eyes, capable fingers, movement
    Graceful and certain; my slow puzzled smile
    Accusing of too much ingenuousness
    Yet offered more than I could hope to achieve,
    And if I thought I loved, no man would doubt it."
    So speaks the image as I read her mind,
    Or is it my pride speaks on her behalf,
    Ventriloquizing to deceive myself?
    Anger, grief, jealousy, shame confuse the issue,
    Her beauty is a truth I can not blink
    However angry, jealous, sad, ashamed.

    Dissolve, image, dissolve!
    Make no appeal to the hunter in my nature,
    Leave me to self-reproach in my own time;
    If I too promised more than you could meet,
    Your beauty overrode my sense of fate
    And fitness, with extravagant pretence.
    Is it true that we were lovers once, or nearly?
    Lovers should sleep together on one pillow
    Clasped in each others arms with lip to lip,
    Their bed should be a masterpiece of ease,
    A mother-of-pearl embrace for its twin pearls.
    But where do you sleep now, and where am I?
    Disdaining all the comforts of old use
    We fall apart, are made ridiculous.
    You in your cell toss miserably enough
    Under thin blankets on a springless couch,
    And I two hundred miles away or further
    Wallow in this feather bed,
    With nothing else to rest my gaze upon
    Than flowery wall-paper, bulging and stained,
    And two stern cardboard signals "_God is love_," and
    "_I was a stranger and ye took Me in_,"
    Ye took me in, took me in, took me in, ...
    The train of my thought straggles, loses touch,
    Piles in confusion, takes the longer road,
    Runs anyhow, heads true only by chance.
    Sacred Carnivals trundle through my mind,
    With Rhyme-compulsion mottoing each waggon.
    _God's Love_, _the Holy Dove_, and _Heaven above_
    _Sin_, _deadly Sin_, _Begin_, _the Fight to Win_
    _Ye took me in_; _inn_; _inn_; -- and now a jolt
    Returns me consciousness, and weary Logic
    Gathers her snapped threads up. A mouldy inn
    Offensive with cockchafers, sour and musty,
    All night the signboard creaks and the blinds bang,
    The cupboards groan, the draught under the door
    Flurries the carpets of this inn, this inn.
    How I came here? Where else could I be bettered?
    Loneliness drew me here and cloudy weather
    With cold Spring rains to chill me through and through
    Pelting across the mountains, purging away
    Affection for a fault, restoring faith....
    So God is Love? Admitted; still the thought
    Is Dead Sea fruit to angry baffled lovers
    Lying sleepless and alone in double beds,
    Shaken in mind, harassed with hot blood fancies.
    Break the ideal, and the animal's left
    Which this ideal stood as mask to hide.
    Then the hot blood with no law hindering it
    Drums and buffets suddenly at the heart
    And seeks a vent with what lies first to hand.

    But yet no earthbound evil spirit comes
    Taking advantage of my unwrought mind,
    Tempting me to a gay concubinage,
    In likeness of some ancient queen of heaven
    Ardent and ever young. The legends say
    They come to hermits so, and holy saints,
    Disguised in a most blinding loveliness;
    Disrobe about the good man's bed and twitch
    His blankets off and make as if to kiss him
    With sighs of passion irresistibly sweet.
    Yet he has power to turn on them, to cry
    "In the name of Christ begone!" and go they must.
    If I were a hermit now -- but being myself
    I never give them challenge, never bend
    Kneeling at my bedside for hours together
    Praying aloud for chastity -- that's the bait
    Certain to draw them from their shadowy caves,
    Their broken shrines and rockbound fastnesses -- 
    Praying against the World, the Flesh, the Devil,
    But pausing most on Flesh -- that praying against,
    Proposing yet denying the fixed wish!
    Closest expressed it's the most dangerous....

    How would I _say my prayers_ now, if I tried,
    Using what formula? Would instinct turn
    To
            Gentle Jesus meek and mild
            Look upon thy little child
    To Gentle Jesus and the entrancing picture
    Of _Pretty mice in Plicity_ (where alas,
    Is County Plicity now? Beyond what skyline?
    I climbed in vain to-day).... When Rachel prays,
    Does she still dreamily speak to Gentle Jesus,
    The shepherd in that Nurnberg oleograph
    Hanging above the nursery mantlepiece?
    Her God? Anthropomorphic surely. One
    Bearded like Moses, straddled on the clouds,
    Armed with thunderbolts and shaggy eyebrows.
    "Bless me, dear God, and make me a good child."
    Her childishness obscures her womanhood.
    When was I ever conscious in her presence
    That she was bodily formed like other women
    With womb for bearing and with breasts for suckling,
    With power, when she desired, to rouse in me
    By but the slightest art in diminution
    Of her accustomed childish truthfulness,
    A word or gesture hinting doubtfulness,
    The angry stream flooding beyond restraint?
    And yet no frisky wraith has come to-night
    Assuming Rachel's body, goading me
    With false presentment of her honest person
    To mutiny and to utter overthrow;
    No wanton Venus, no bold Helen of Troy.

    For look, a different play performs to-night!
    See how come crowding in, with a bold air
    Of pertinence I do not dare to question
    This odd rag-tag-and-bobtail of lost souls,
    Ecclesiastical, furtive, dim, far gone
    In their _dementia praecox_! Doctor Hornblow
    On the Pentateuch, Dean Dogma upon Ruth
    (Ay, Ruth; the alien corn was not the worst)
    Keble and Pusey, Moody and Sankey griddling,
    And one most strange Victorian apparition,
    The ghost of Gladstone, with his stickout collars,
    Goes hand in hand with Senor Monkey-brand,
    Comrades who, printed on a paper cover,
    Gladstone in front and Monkey on the back,
    Made the _Impregnable Rock of Holy Scripture_
    Tacit defence of Darwin's blasphemies.
    There go the ghosts of Mason, Martin Tupper,
    Dean Farrar, South, Cautionary Mrs. Turner,
    Butterfield with a spotted senior clerk,
    And a long rabble of confusing figures,
    Nuns, deacons, theologians, commentators,
    Spikes in birettas, missionaries like apes
    Hairy and chattering, bald; with, everyone,
    A book in the left hand tight clasped, the right
    Free to point scorn.
                        My cauliflower-wicked candle
    Gutters and splutters on the chair beside me,
    Over two books and a letter; the crowd passing
    Groans for reproach, confident in their numbers.
    But I, long used to crowds and their cowardly ways,
    Return these insults with the cold set eye
    That break their corporate pride -- 
                        What? those are plays.
    Yes, dramas by John Ford -- _Love's Sacrifice_,
    _The Broken Heart_, _'Tis Pity she's a Whore_.
    The titles shock? These things are "not convenient?"
    Well, try this other by (ah) Canon Trout,
    _The Wisest Course of Love_ -- why do you smile?
    The book of plays I bought, this was a present,
    Sent me with Rachel's letter -- but you smile,
    You're smiling still? Then I apologize,
    Ladies and Lords. Indeed I never guessed
    Humour was a luxury you admitted.
    "'Tis pity she's a ... postulant." Is it that?
    Malicious hearts! but you still nod, laugh, point,
    Pointing what joke? _The Wisest Course of Love?_
    Yes?
      I don't see. I'll buy it for a forfeit.
    Then a red-haired beaky-nosed burly nun
    Called Sister Agatha, so I tell myself,
    Comes nearer, throws her veil aside, takes up
    The envelope of the letter. Now she lays
    A manicured finger on the office post-mark,
    Leering down in my face.
                            I see it now,
    You ugly she-bear. Wisest Course of Love
    Is _Maidenhead_? Then you have read the letter?
    Dictated it quite likely? You, then, you!
    I know you, nun-official set to guide
    The postulants through their long penances
    And stern soul-searchings -- with the twisted grin
    Of a bawd mistress, none too well concealed,
    You greeted Rachel in the Convent Hall,
    And peered and saw that she was beautiful,
    Giving her welcome with a sisterly kiss.

    Mother Superior was quite satisfied
    After inquiry in Burke's _Landed Gentry_
    That the newcomer was a suitable
    Candidate for the Order of Seven Sorrows.
    It's _so important_ to have _ladies only_!
    You twirl dear Mother round a little finger;
    You know her weaknesses, emotionalism,
    Snobbery, love of ritual; quite content
    To let her have her way in formal matters
    If you may mould the spirit of the place
    By due control of youthful aspirants,
    Postulants and novices -- with the glow
    Of great devotion, honesty itself,
    You teach them hatred of their woman-flesh
    Eying their bodies with flagellant gaze
    Approving shame's rebellion. _Maidenhead!_
    A well spiced joke! The carnal maidenhead
    Untaken, but the maidenhead of spirit
    Stolen away. Rachel in your good care!

    She says three years' probation. For three years
    Humiliation, then she takes the veil
    And goes for ever.... "But of course, dear Friend,
    (Where did she learn "Dear Friend?")
    Should I discover when I search my heart
    That God has sealed me for some other life,
    That my intended vow of resignation
    Is only pride, why then I'm free again.
    I pray for you," etc., and etc.
    Dear Friend? lover or nothing it must be.
    I'm tired of friends, I'm past the need of friends.

    We never talked religion till that day.
    I took for granted Rachel used her sense,
    Thought for herself without the aid of priests
    On spiritual matters: I? I never trouble
    About such talk one year's end to the next,
    But one day argument began; she started
    On Christian meekness, the low slavish virtue
    "Tapeinophrosune", obsequiousness,
    Which I called nonsense. "Nonsense?" (with wide eyes)
    "Or call it poetry. Christ was never meek.
    Let meekness crawl below in catacombs,
    Pride drives the money-changers with a scourge,
    Keeps silence to accusers, chooses death
    When an escape is more acceptable
    To justice than embarrassment of killing.
    I'm talking paradox? I never meant it."
    (Here I grew nettled at her wooden look)
    "And as for `feeling Jesus in my heart`
    What _does_ that mean? explain!
    I might acknowledge that historically
    All generous action flows from the prime source
    Of Jesus' teaching (though give Plato credit
    And Aristotle). But Jesus as a power
    Alive, praying, pleading like a ouija spirit,
    Or _Laughing Eyes_ the seance influence,
    That's stupid and unnecessary, in my mind.
    I am a man, I am proud, Jesus was man and proud;
    He died fulfilling, and his soul found peace.
    I greet him friendly down the gulf of years."
    "But no!" she said "There _is_ a Spirit of Jesus
    Say what you like, there _is_ a Spirit of Jesus."
    So I allowed her that, changing my front
    Saying, "If Jesus died on Cross, He's dead,
    In so far as Mary's son, the prophet died
    But hardly was He dead,
    Than up this elemental demon sprang
    Assuming mastership of Jesus' school
    Using his body, even, so it's told
    Calling himself by name of _Jesus Risen_.
    Who was he? Some poor godling, fallen through pride
    And greed of human flesh, on evil days.
    He changed his heart and once more stood for power,
    A roaring lion in the white lamb's fleece,
    So by a long campaign of self-abasement
    And self-effacement grown mob-strong at length
    He overturned high Heaven, now rules the world.
    Yes, he's a powerful devil; we are his sons
    Got on she-furies of our Northern gales.
    We hate the inheritance entailed on us
    And the outlandish family coat we blazon,
    The tell-tale features also; would deny
    His fatherhood, but for that eye, that nose,
    Betraying Galilee our Father's land.
    There's no escape from him. Midwife Tradition
    Has knotted Jesus in our navel strings
    Never to be undone this side the grave."
    But that was one stage worse than blasphemy.
    And when we parted, she smiled grudgingly.
    I had said too much and cut her to the quick.
    She thought, poor child, she had her choice to make
    Between God's way and my way. And so she chose ...
    This letter ... But she writes of Christian love.
    What _is_ that? It's a most annoying habit,
    A warm blood-teasing smile, an open look,
    A recognition -- thinks I to myself,
    Boy, this is fine! Love at first sight! True love!
    But then the disillusionment -- by God
    She turns the same look of those clear kind eyes
    On a bootblack, on some fool behind a counter.
    She calls that, Love? But what _is_ Love to me?
    Love; it's a two-part game, I'd say, not merely
    The searching radiations from one eye,
    That fly about with indiscriminate force -- 
    Sometimes unthinking in a public place
    I stare at girls sitting sideface to me
    And wonder at their beauty, summing it up,
    Then being innocent girls (I'd never look
    At others so) they grow aware of the heat
    That pours out from my eyes; but do not see me.
    (I may be fifty feet away or more)
    They fidget in their seats, uncross their knees,
    Pull down their skirts to hide even their ankles,
    Blush furiously and gaze about, in trouble;
    Then I start guiltily, rise and walk away;
    But that's not Love, the searching and the heat;
    Love is an act of God, akin to Faith,
    Call it the union of two prayers by Faith
    (Here we come back to prayer by a long circuit
    And back to "God is Love")
    But to explain again what's Faith, what's prayer,
    That's the teaser! much too hard for me.

    Still, these are not Christian monopolies.
    What's Faith but power stripped of its ornaments,
    Grants, title-deeds and such like accidentals;
    Force won by disentangling from the mind
    All hampering ties of luxury and tradition,
    Possessions, loyalties and hobby-horses?
    Cast all these overboard, and Faith is left,
    Faith potent through its prayer to miracles,
    Whether in name of Jesus or Jim Crow.
    Prayer: Rachel seems to think the collects prayer,
    And Mother Superior, I make no doubt,
    Will teach her scores of neatly turned devotions
    Couched in diminutives and pastoral terms,
    (Lord, how I hate the _literary_ prayer),
    Little white lambs indeed -- O baa baa black sheep
    Have you any wool? -- And Rachel in return
    Flushing with shame impetuously confesses,
    And holds half back, but crafty eyes are watching
    To drag all out, so Rachel has to tell
    How on the river bank one morning early
    The water was so clear, the sun so warm,
    She kissed me suddenly and was kissed by me -- 
    Lip kisses, that was all, and fingers clasped.
    Mother Superior then demanding further
    Will cross-examine her on how and why.
    "To tell it now will mortify the passion,
    Then when you make your general confession
    To Father James, your mind will have found peace."
    (A good excuse) "What then were your sensations,
    The physical joy, tell me, my erring lamb!
    Tell me, I beg, but as the sin was pleasant
    So must confession of the sin be pain...."

    "Tis pity she's a whore". Rachel told all.
    _Whore_, traitress to the secret rites of love,
    Publisher of the not-communicable.
    If she refused the vows? If her heart changed?
    Rachel and I? This meek ex-novice rifled
    Of her love-secrets? medals and images
    Sewn in her skirts, Birmingham images
    From the totem-factory, niched in her heart?
    No, Love is fusion of Prayer, and prayer must be
    The flash of faith, unformulated words
    Demanding an accomplishment of Love
    With noise of thunder, against circumstance,
    And Rachel forfeits there all power to love.

    Who's this? For now the rabble have passed through,
    Going unnoticed out; Mother Superior
    Secretly with one finger at her lips,
    Re-enters, carefully locks my bedroom door,
    Now she disrobes with fingers trembling so
    They tear the fastenings -- naked she steps out
    To practise with her long-past-bearing body
    The wiles of the Earthbound (Ah, the fine young man,
    The hot young man whose kisses tasted sweet
    To our new postulant!) Madam, I beg you!
    You have mistaken the room; no, next door sleeps
    A lusty bagman, he's the man to embrace you
    And welcome you with every brisk refinement
    Of passion. But while _you_ rumple his sheets,
    The innocent and unhappy eyes of Rachel
    Bewilder me -- Oh then in spite of Faith
    I am cast down -- You nuns, but if I needed,
    As I no longer need, I'd challenge you
    To contest of hard praying, one against all.
    I could wrest Rachel back even to this bed
    To-night. But Faith, and Prayer that's born of Faith
    Find her slow mind impediment to their power,
    So I resign her -- Agatha, do your worst.

    The wisest course of Love? Yes, maidenhead.
    For me? Love's Sacrifice? It was not love.
    The Broken Heart? Not mine. I'll say no more
    Than mere _goodbye_. Go, get you to your nunnery,
    And out the candle! Darkness absolute
    Surrounds me, sleepy mother of good children
    Who drowse and drowse and cry not for the sun,
    Content and wisest of their generation.




EPILOGUE.


    The morning star, over the mountains peering,
    Spoke to him not too distant for his hearing: -- 

    _I am the star of morning poised between_
    _The dead night and the coming of the sun,_
    _Yet neither relic of the dark nor pointing_
    _The angry day to come. My virtue is_
    _My own, a mild light, a relief a pity_
    _And the remembering ancient tribe of birds_
    _Sing blithest at my showing; only Man_
    _Sleeps on and stirs rebellious in his sleep._
    _Lucifer, Lucifer am I, millstone-crushed_
    _Between conflicting powers of doubleness,_
    _By envious Night lost in her myriad more_
    _Counterfeit glints, in day-time quite overwhelmed_
    _By tyrant blazing of the warrior sun._
    _Yet some, my prophets who at midnight held me_
    _Fixedly framed in their observant glass,_
    _By daylight also, sinking well shafts deep_
    _For water and for coolness of pure thought_
    _Gaze up and far above them see me shining_
    _Me, single natured, without gender, one_
    _The only spark of Godhead unresolved._

    But the lover gave no heed, so through his dreams
    Marched back the rabble rout, they glowered upon him
    But grown more awful and more reverend,
    Poor things before, now garbed in ancient dress,
    Bearded patriarchs and angry sybils
    Levites with censers, chariot riding kings,
    With comminations of hell fire and plague.
    Then even Nehushtan, the snake finger-post,
    Nehushtan which the credulous Hezekiah
    Spurned for superstitious, would have eased him,
    Or the bellowing voice of Aaron's molten calf.


Heliodora


    _Wash of cold river
    in a glacial land,
    Ionian water,
    chill, snow-ribbed sand,
    drift of rare flowers,
    clear, with delicate shell-
    like leaf enclosing
    frozen lily-leaf,
    camellia texture,
    colder than a rose;_

    _wind-flower
    that keeps the breath
    of the north-wind -- 
    these and none other;_

    _intimate thoughts and kind
    reach out to share
    the treasure of my mind,
    intimate hands and dear
    draw garden-ward and sea-ward
    all the sheer rapture
    that I would take
    to mould a clear
    and frigid statue;_

    _rare, of pure texture,
    beautiful space and line,
    marble to grace
    your inaccessible shrine._




        _Holy Satyr_


    Most holy Satyr,
    like a goat,
    with horns and hooves
    to match thy coat
    of russet brown,
    I make leaf-circlets
    and a crown of honey-flowers
    for thy throat;
    where the amber petals
    drip to ivory,
    I cut and slip
    each stiffened petal
    in the rift
    of carven petal;
    honey horn
    has wed the bright
    virgin petal of the white
    flower cluster: lip to lip
    let them whisper,
    let them lilt, quivering.

    Most holy Satyr,
    like a goat,
    hear this our song,
    accept our leaves,
    love-offering,
    return our hymn,
    like echo fling
    a sweet song,
    answering note for note.




        _Lais_


    Let her who walks in Paphos
    take the glass,
    let Paphos take the mirror
    and the work of frosted fruit,
    gold apples set
    with silver apple-leaf,
    white leaf of silver
    wrought with vein of gilt.

    Let Paphos lift the mirror,
    let her look
    into the polished centre of the disk.

    Let Paphos take the mirror;
    did she press
    flowerlet of flame-flower
    to the lustrous white
    of the white forehead?
    did the dark veins beat
    a deeper purple
    than the wine-deep tint
    of the dark flower?

    Did she deck black hair
    one evening, with the winter-white
    flower of the winter-berry,
    did she look (reft of her lover)
    at a face gone white
    under the chaplet
    of white virgin-breath?

    Lais, exultant, tyrannizing Greece,
    Lais who kept her lovers in the porch,
    lover on lover waiting,
    (but to creep
    where the robe brushed the threshold
    where still sleeps Lais,)
    so she creeps, Lais,
    to lay her mirror at the feet
    of her who reigns in Paphos.

    Lais has left her mirror
    for she sees no longer in its depth
    the Lais' self
    that laughed exultant
    tyrannizing Greece.

    Lais has left her mirror,
    for she weeps no longer,
    finding in its depth,
    a face, but other
    than dark flame and white
    feature of perfect marble.

    _Lais has left her mirror_,
    (so one wrote)
    _to her who reigns in Paphos;
    Lais who laughed a tyrant over Greece,
    Lais who turned the lovers from the porch,
    that swarm for whom now
    Lais has no use;
    Lais is now no lover of the glass,
    seeing no more the face as once it was,
    wishing to see that face and finding this_.




        _Heliodora_


    He and I sought together,
    over the spattered table,
    rhymes and flowers,
    gifts for a name.

    He said, among others,
    I will bring
    (and the phrase was just and good,
    but not as good as mine,)
    the narcissus that loves the rain.

    We strove for a name,
    while the light of the lamps burnt thin
    and the outer dawn came in,
    a ghost, the last at the feast
    or the first,
    to sit within
    with the two that remained
    to quibble in flowers and verse
    over a girl's name.

    He said, the rain loving,
    I said, the narcissus, drunk,
    drunk with the rain.

    Yet I had lost
    for he said,
    the rose, the lover's gift,
    is loved of love,
    he said it,
    loved of love;
    I waited, even as he spoke,
    to see the room filled with a light,
    as when in winter
    the embers catch in a wind
    when a room is dank;
    so it would be filled, I thought,
    our room with a light
    when he said
    (and he said it first,)
    the rose, the lover's delight,
    is loved of love,
    but the light was the same.

    Then he caught,
    seeing the fire in my eyes,
    my fire, my fever, perhaps,
    for he leaned
    with the purple wine
    stained on his sleeve,
    and said this:
    did you ever think
    a girl's mouth
    caught in a kiss,
    is a lily that laughs?

    I had not.
    I saw it now
    as men must see it forever afterwards;
    no poet could write again,
    the red-lily,
    a girl's laugh caught in a kiss;
    it was his to pour in the vat
    from which all poets dip and quaff,
    for poets are brothers in this.

    So I saw the fire in his eyes,
    it was almost my fire,
    (he was younger,)
    I saw the face so white,
    my heart beat,
    it was almost my phrase;
    I said, surprise the muses,
    take them by surprise;
    it is late,
    rather it is dawn-rise,
    those ladies sleep, the nine,
    our own king's mistresses.

    A name to rhyme,
    flowers to bring to a name,
    what was one girl faint and shy,
    with eyes like the myrtle,
    (I said: her underlids
    are rather like myrtle,)
    to vie with the nine?

    Let him take the name,
    he had the rhymes,
    the rose, loved of love,
    the lily, a mouth that laughs,
    he had the gift,
    the scented crocus,
    the purple hyacinth,
    what was one girl to the nine?

    He said:
    I will make her a wreath;
    he said:
    I will write it thus:

    _I will bring you the lily that laughs,_
    _I will twine_
    _with soft narcissus, the myrtle,_
    _sweet crocus, white violet,_
    _the purple hyacinth, and last,_
    _the rose, loved-of-love,_
    _that these may drip on your hair_
    _the less soft flowers,_
    _may mingle sweet with the sweet_
    _of Heliodora's locks,_
    _myrrh-curled._

    (He wrote myrrh-curled,
    I think, the first.)

    I said:
    they sleep, the nine,
    when he shouted swift and passionate:
    _that_ for the nine!
    above the hills
    the sun is about to wake,
    _and to-day white violets_
    _shine beside white lilies_
    _adrift on the mountain side;_
    _to-day the narcissus opens_
    _that loves the rain_.

    I watched him to the door,
    catching his robe
    as the wine-bowl crashed to the floor,
    spilling a few wet lees,
    (ah, his purple hyacinth!)
    I saw him out of the door,
    I thought:
    there will never be a poet
    in all the centuries after this,
    who will dare write,
    after my friend's verse,
    a girl's mouth
    is a lily kissed.




        _Helen_


    All Greece hates
    the still eyes in the white face,
    the lustre as of olives
    where she stands,
    and the white hands.

    All Greece reviles
    the wan face when she smiles,
    hating it deeper still
    when it grows wan and white,
    remembering past enchantments
    and past ills.

    Greece sees unmoved,
    God's daughter, born of love,
    the beauty of cool feet
    and slenderest knees,
    could love indeed the maid,
    only if she were laid,
    white ash amid funereal cypresses.




        _Nossis_


    I thought to hear him speak
    the girl might rise
    and make the garden silver,
    as the white moon breaks,
    Nossis, he cried, a flame.

    I said:
    a girl that's dead
    some hundred years;
    a poet -- what of that?
    for in the islands,
    in the haunts of Greek Ionia,
    Rhodes and Cyprus,
    girls are cheap.

    I said, to test his mood,
    to make him rage or laugh or sing or weep,
    in Greek Ionia and in Cyprus,
    many girls are found
    with wreaths and apple-branches.

    Only a hundred years or two or three,
    has she lain dead
    yet men forget;
    he said,
    I want a garden,
    and I thought
    he wished to make a terrace on the hill,
    bend the stream to it,
    set out daffodils,
    plant Phrygian violets,
    such was his will and whim,
    I thought,
    to name and watch each flower.

    His was no garden
    bright with Tyrian violets,
    his was a shelter
    wrought of flame and spirit,
    and as he flung her name
    against the dark,
    I thought the iris-flowers
    that lined the path
    must be the ghost of Nossis.

    _Who made the wreath,_
    _for what man was it wrought?_
    _speak, fashioned all of fruit-buds,_
    _song, my loveliest,_
    _say Meleager brought to Diodes_,
    (_a gift for that enchanting friend_)
    _memories with names of poets._

    _He sought for Moero, lilies,
    and those many,
    red-lilies for Anyte,
    for Sappho, roses,
    with those few, he caught
    that breath of the sweet-scented
    leaf of iris,
    the myrrh-iris,
    to set beside the tablet
    and the wax
    which Love had burnt,
    when scarred across by Nossis._
          
    when she wrote:

    _I Nossis stand by this:
    I state that love is sweet:
    if you think otherwise
    assert what beauty
    or what charm_
    _after the charm of love,
    retains its grace?_

    _Honey you say:
    honey? I say I spit
    honey out of my mouth:
    nothing is second-best
    after the sweet of Eros._

    _I Nossis stand and state
    that he whom Love neglects
    has naught, no flower, no grace,
    who lacks that rose, her kiss._

    I thought to hear him speak
    the girl might rise
    and make the garden silver
    as the white moon breaks,
    Nossis, he cried, a flame.




        _Centaur Song_


    Now that the day is done,
    now that the night creeps soft
    and dims the chestnut clusters'
    radiant spike of flower,
    O sweet, till dawn
    break through the branches
    of our orchard-garden,
    rest in this shelter
    of the osier-wood and thorn.

    They fall,
    the apple-flowers;
    nor softer grace has Aphrodite
    in the heaven afar,
    nor at so fair a pace
    open the flower-petals
    as your face bends down,
    while, breath on breath,
    your mouth wanders
    from my mouth o'er my face.

    What have I left
    to bring you in this place,
    already sweet with violets?
    (those you brought
    with swathes of earliest grass,
    forest and meadow balm,
    flung from your giant arms
    for us to rest upon.)

    Fair are these petals
    broken by your feet;
    your horse's hooves
    tread softer than a deer's;
    your eyes, startled,
    are like the deer eyes
    while your heart
    trembles more than the deer.

    O earth, O god,
    O forest, stream or river,
    what shall I bring
    that all the day hold back,
    that Dawn remember Love
    and rest upon her bed,
    and Zeus, forgetful not of Danae or Maia,

    bid the stars shine forever.




        _Oread_


    Whirl up, sea -- 
    whirl your pointed pines,
    splash your great pines
    on our rocks,
    hurl your green over us,
    cover us with your pools of fir.




        _The Pool_


    Are you alive?
    I touch you.
    You quiver like a sea-fish.
    I cover you with my net.
    What are you -- banded one?




        _Thetis_


    He had asked for immortal life
    in the old days and had grown old,
    now he had aged apace,
    he asked for his youth,
    and I, Thetis, granted him

    freedom under the sea
    drip and welter of weeds,
    the drift of the fringing grass,
    the gift of the never-withering moss,
    and the flowering reed,

    and most,
    beauty of fifty nereids,
    sisters of nine,
    I one of their least,
    yet great and a goddess,
    granted Pelius,

    love under the sea,
    beauty, grace infinite:

    So I crept, at last,
    a crescent, a curve of a wave,
    (a man would have thought,
    had he watched for his nets
    on the beach)
    a dolphin, a glistening fish,
    that burnt and caught for its light,
    the light of the undercrest
    of the lifting tide,
    a fish with silver for breast,
    with no light but the light
    of the sea it reflects.

    Little he would have guessed,
    (had such a one
    watched by his nets,)
    that a goddess flung from the crest
    of the wave the blue of its own
    bright tress of hair,
    the blue of the painted stuff
    it wore for dress.

    No man would have known save he,
    whose coming I sensed as I strung
    my pearl and agate and pearl,
    to mark the beat and the stress
    of the lilt of my song.

    _Who dreams of a son,
    save one,
    childless, having no bright
    face to flatter its own,
    who dreams of a son?_

    _Nereids under the sea,
    my sisters, fifty and one_,
    (_counting myself_)
    _they dream of a child
    of water and sea,
    with hair of the softest,
    to lie along the curve
    of fragile, tiny bones,
    yet more beautiful each than each,
    hair more bright and long,
    to rival its own._

    _Nereids under the wave,
    who dreams of a son
    save I, Thetis, alone?_

    _Each would have for a child,
    a stray self, furtive and wild,
    to dive and leap to the wind,
    to wheedle and coax_
    _the stray birds bright and bland
    of foreign strands,
    to crawl and stretch on the sands,
    each would have for its own,
    a daughter for child._

    _Who dreams, who sings of a son?
    I, Thetis, alone._

    When I had finished my song,
    and dropped the last seed-pearl,
    and flung the necklet
    about my throat
    and found it none too bright,
    not bright enough nor pale
    enough, not like the moon that creeps
    beneath the sea,
    between the lift of crest and crest,
    had tried it on
    and found it not
    quite fair enough
    to fill the night
    of my blue folds of bluest dress
    with moon for light,
    I cast the beads aside and leapt,
    myself all blue
    with no bright gloss
    of pearls for crescent light;

    but one alert, all blue and wet,
    I flung myself, an arrow's flight,
    straight upward
    through the blue of night
    that was my palace wall,
    and crept to where I saw the mark
    of feet, a rare foot-fall:

    Achilles' sandal on the beach,
    could one mistake?
    perhaps a lover or a nymph,
    lost from the tangled fern and brake,
    that lines the upper shelf of land,
    perhaps a goddess or a nymph
    might so mistake
    Achilles' footprint for the trace
    of a bright god alert to track
    the panther where he slinks for thirst
    across the sand;

    perhaps a goddess or a nymph,
    might think a god had crossed the track
    of weed and drift,
    had broken here this stem of reed,
    had turned this sea-shell to the light:

    So she must stoop, this goddess girl,
    or nymph, with crest of blossoming wood
    about her hair for cap or crown,
    must stoop and kneel and bending down,
    must kiss the print of such a one.

    Not I, the mother, Thetis self,
    I stretched and lay, a river's slim
    dark length,
    a rivulet where it leaves the wood,
    and meets the sea,
    I lay along the burning sand,
    a river's blue.




        _At Ithaca_


    Over and back,
    the long waves crawl
    and track the sand with foam;
    night darkens and the sea
    takes on that desperate tone
    of dark that wives put on
    when all their love is done.

    Over and back,
    the tangled thread falls slack,
    over and up and on;
    over and all is sewn;
    now while I bind the end,
    I wish some fiery friend
    would sweep impetuously
    these fingers from the loom.

    My weary thoughts
    play traitor to my soul,
    just as the toil is over;
    swift while the woof is whole,
    turn now my spirit, swift,
    and tear the pattern there,
    the flowers so deftly wrought,
    the border of sea-blue,
    the sea-blue coast of home.

    The web was over-fair,
    that web of pictures there,
    enchantments that I thought
    he had, that I had lost;
    weaving his happiness
    within the stitching frame,
    weaving his fire and fame,
    I thought my work was done,
    I prayed that only one
    of those that I had spurned,
    might stoop and conquer this
    long waiting with a kiss.

    But each time that I see
    my work so beautifully
    inwoven and would keep
    the picture and the whole,
    Athene steels my soul,
    slanting across my brain,
    I see as shafts of rain
    his chariot and his shafts,
    I see the arrows fall,
    I see my lord who moves
    like Hector, lord of love,
    I see him matched with fair
    bright rivals and I see
    those lesser rivals flee.




        _We Two_


    We two are left:
    I with small grace reveal
    distaste and bitterness;
    you with small patience
    take my hands;
    though effortless,
    you scald their weight
    as a bowl, lined with embers,
    wherein droop
    great petals of white rose,
    forced by the heat
    too soon to break.

    We two are left:
    as a blank wall, the world,
    earth and the men who talk,
    saying their space of life
    is good and gracious,
    with eyes blank
    as that blank surface
    their ignorance mistakes
    for final shelter
    and a resting-place.

    We two remain:
    yet by what miracle,
    searching within the tangles of my brain,
    I ask again,
    have we two met within
    this maze of daedal paths
    in-wound mid grievous stone,
    where once I stood alone?




        _Fragment Thirty-six_



    I know not what to do,
    my mind is reft:
    is song's gift best?
    is love's gift loveliest?
    I know not what to do,
    now sleep has pressed
    weight on your eyelids.

    Shall I break your rest,
    devouring, eager?
    is love's gift best?
    nay, song's the loveliest:
    yet were you lost,
    what rapture
    could I take from song?
    what song were left?

    I know not what to do:
    to turn and slake
    the rage that burns,
    with my breath burn
    and trouble your cool breath?
    so shall I turn and take
    snow in my arms?
    (is love's gift best?)
    yet flake on flake
    of snow were comfortless,
    did you lie wondering,
    wakened yet unawake.

    Shall I turn and take
    comfortless snow within my arms?
    press lips to lips
    that answer not,
    press lips to flesh
    that shudders not nor breaks?

    Is love's gift best?
    shall I turn and slake
    all the wild longing?
    O I am eager for you!
    as the Pleiads shake
    white light in whiter water
    so shall I take you?

    My mind is quite divided,
    my minds hesitate,
    so perfect matched,
    I know not what to do:
    each strives with each
    as two white wrestlers
    standing for a match,
    ready to turn and clutch
    yet never shake muscle nor nerve nor tendon;
    so my mind waits
    to grapple with my mind,
    yet I lie quiet,
    I would seem at rest.

    I know not what to do:
    strain upon strain,
    sound surging upon sound
    makes my brain blind;
    as a wave-line may wait to fall
    yet (waiting for its falling)
    still the wind may take
    from off its crest,
    white flake on flake of foam,
    that rises,
    seeming to dart and pulse
    and rend the light,
    so my mind hesitates
    above the passion
    quivering yet to break,
    so my mind hesitates
    above my mind,
    listening to song's delight.

    I know not what to do:
    will the sound break,
    rending the night
    with rift on rift of rose
    and scattered light?
    will the sound break at last
    as the wave hesitant,
    or will the whole night pass
    and I lie listening awake?




        _Flute Song_


    Little scavenger away,
    touch not the door,
    beat not the portal down,
    cross not the sill,
    silent until
    my song, bright and shrill,
    breathes out its lay.

    Little scavenger avaunt,
    tempt me with jeer and taunt,
    yet you will wait to-day;
    for it were surely ill
    to mock and shout and revel;
    it were more fit to tell
    with flutes and calathes,
    your mother's praise.




        _After Troy_


    We flung against their gods,
    invincible, clear hate;
    we fought;
    frantic, we flung the last
    imperious, desperate shaft

    and lost:
    we knew the loss
    before they ever guessed
    fortune had tossed to them
    her favour and her whim;
    but how were we depressed?
    we lost yet as we pressed
    our spearsmen on their best,
    we knew their line invincible
    because there fell
    on them no shiverings
    of the white enchanteress,
    radiant Aphrodite's spell:

    we hurled our shafts of passion,
    noblest hate,
    and knew their cause was blest,
    and knew their gods were nobler,
    better taught in skill,
    subtler with wit of thought,
    yet had it been God's will
    that _they_ not we should fall,
    we know those fields had bled
    with roses lesser red.




        _Cassandra_

        _O Hymen king._


    Hymen, O Hymen king,
    what bitter thing is this?
    what shaft, tearing my heart?
    what scar, what light, what fire
    searing my eye-balls and my eyes with flame?
    nameless, O spoken name,
    king, lord, speak blameless Hymen.

    Why do you blind my eyes?
    why do you dart and pulse
    till all the dark is home,
    then find my soul
    and ruthless draw it back?
    scaling the scaleless,
    opening the dark?
    speak, nameless, power and might;
    when will you leave me quite?
    when will you break my wings
    or leave them utterly free
    to scale heaven endlessly?

    A bitter, broken thing,
    my heart, O Hymen lord,
    yet neither drought nor sword
    baffles men quite,
    why must they feign to fear
    my virgin glance?
    feigned utterly or real
    why do they shrink?
    my trance frightens them,
    breaks the dance,
    empties the market place;
    if I but pass they fall
    back, frantically;
    must always people mock?
    unless they shrink and reel
    as in the temple
    at your uttered will.

    O Hymen king,
    lord, greatest, power, might,
    look for my face is dark,
    burnt with your light,
    your fire, O Hymen lord;
    is there none left
    can equal me
    in ecstasy, desire?
    is there none left
    can bear with me
    the kiss of your white fire?
    is there not one,
    Phrygian or frenzied Greek,
    poet, song-swept, or bard,
    one meet to take from me
    this bitter power of song,
    one fit to speak, Hymen,
    your praises, lord?

    May I not wed
    as you have wed?
    may it not break, beauty,
    from out my hands, my head, my feet?
    may Love not lie beside me
    till his heat
    burn me to ash?
    may he not comfort me, then,
    spent of all that fire and heat,
    still, ashen-white and cool
    as the wet laurels,
    white, before your feet
    step on the mountain-slope,
    before your fiery hand
    lift up the mantle
    covering flower and land,
    as a man lifts,
    O Hymen, from his bride,
    (cowering with woman eyes,) the veil?
    O Hymen lord, be kind.




        _Epigrams_



    O ruthless, perilous, imperious hate,
    you can not thwart
    the promptings of my soul,
    you can not weaken nay nor dominate
    Love that is mateless,
    Love the rite,
    the whole measure of being:
    would you crush with bondage?
    nay, you would love me not
    were I your slave.



    Torture me not with this or that or this,
    Love is my master,
    you his lesser self;
    while you are Love,
    I love you generously,
    be Eros,
    not a tyrannous, bitter mate:
    Love has no charm
    when Love is swept to earth:
    you'd make a lop-winged god,
    frozen and contrite,
    of god up-darting,
    winged for passionate flight.




        _Fragment Forty_



    Keep love and he wings
    with his bow,
    up, mocking us,
    keep love and he taunts us
    and escapes.

    Keep love and he sways apart
    in another world,
    outdistancing us.

    Keep love and he mocks,
    ah, bitter and sweet,
    your sweetness is more cruel
    than your hurt.

    Honey and salt,
    fire burst from the rocks
    to meet fire
    spilt from Hesperus.

    Fire darted aloft and met fire:
    in that moment
    love entered us.




    Could Eros be kept?
    he were prisoned long since
    and sick with imprisonment;
    could Eros be kept?
    others would have broken
    and crushed out his life.

    Could Eros be kept?
    we too sinning, by Kypris,
    might have prisoned him outright.

    Could Eros be kept?
    nay, thank him and the bright goddess
    that he left us.




    Ah, love is bitter and sweet,
    but which is more sweet,
    the sweetness
    or the bitterness?
    none has spoken it.

    Love is bitter,
    but can salt taint sea-flowers,
    grief, happiness?

    Is it bitter to give back
    love to your lover
    if he crave it?

    Is it bitter to give back
    love to your lover
    if he wish it
    for a new favourite?
    who can say,
    or is it sweet?

    Is it sweet
    to possess utterly?
    or is it bitter,
    bitter as ash?



    I had thought myself frail;
    a petal,
    with light equal
    on leaf and under-leaf.

    I had thought myself frail;
    a lamp,
    shell, ivory or crust of pearl,
    about to fall shattered,
    with flame spent.

    I cried:
    I must perish,
    I am deserted,
    an outcast, desperate
    in this darkness,
    (such fire rent me with Hesperus,)
    then the day broke.




    What need of a lamp
    when day lightens us,
    what need to bind love
    when love stands
    with such radiant wings
    over us?

    What need -- 
    yet to sing love,
    love must first shatter us.




        _Toward the Piraeus_


    _Slay with your eyes, Greek,
    men over the face of the earth,
    slay with your eyes, the host,
    puny, passionless, weak._

    _Break as the ranks of steel
    broke when the Persian lost:
    craven, we hated them then:
    now we would count them Gods
    beside these, spawn of the earth._

    _Grant us your mantle, Greek;
    grant us but one
    to fright (as your eyes) with a sword,
    men, craven and weak,
    grant us but one to strike
    one blow for you, passionate Greek._




    You would have broken my wings,
    but the very fact that you knew
    I had wings, set some seal
    on my bitter heart, my heart
    broke and fluttered and sang.

    You would have snared me,
    and scattered the strands of my nest;
    but the very fact that you saw,
    sheltered me, claimed me,
    set me apart from the rest

    Of men -- of _men_, made you a god,
    and me, claimed me, set me apart
    and the song in my breast,
    yours, yours forever -- 
    if I escape your evil heart.



    I loved you:
    men have writ and women have said
    they loved,
    but as the Pythoness stands by the altar,
    intense and may not move,

    till the fumes pass over;
    and may not falter or break,
    till the priest has caught the words
    that mar or make
    a deme or a ravaged town;
    so I, though my knees tremble,
    my heart break,
    must note the rumbling,
    heed only the shuddering
    down in the fissure beneath the rock
    of the temple floor;

    must wait and watch
    and may not turn nor move,
    nor break from my trance to speak
    so slight, so sweet,
    so simple a word as love.




    What had you done
    had you been true,
    I can not think,
    I may not know.

    What could we do
    were I not wise,
    what play invent,
    what joy devise?

    What could we do
    if you were great?

    (Yet were you lost,
    who were there then,
    to circumvent
    the tricks of men?)

    What can we do,
    for curious lies
    have filled your heart,
    and in my eyes
    sorrow has writ
    that I am wise.



    If I had been a boy,
    I would have worshipped your grace,
    I would have flung my worship
    before your feet,
    I would have followed apart,
    glad, rent with an ecstasy
    to watch you turn
    your great head, set on the throat,
    thick, dark with its sinews,
    burned and wrought
    like the olive stalk,
    and the noble chin
    and the throat.

    I would have stood,
    and watched and watched
    and burned,
    and when in the night,
    from the many hosts, your slaves,
    and warriors and serving men
    you had turned
    to the purple couch and the flame
    of the woman, tall like the cypress tree
    that flames sudden and swift and free
    as with crackle of golden resin
    and cones and the locks flung free
    like the cypress limbs,
    bound, caught and shaken and loosed,
    bound, caught and riven and bound
    and loosened again,
    as in rain of a kingly storm
    or wind full from a desert plain.

    So, when you had risen
    from all the lethargy of love and its heat,
    you would have summoned me,
    me alone,
    and found my hands,
    beyond all the hands in the world,
    cold, cold, cold,
    intolerably cold and sweet.


    It was not chastity that made me cold nor fear,
    only I knew that you, like myself, were sick
    of the puny race that crawls and quibbles and lisps
    of love and love and lovers and love's deceit.

    It was not chastity that made me wild, but fear
    that my weapon, tempered in different heat,
    was over-matched by yours, and your hand
    skilled to yield death-blows, might break

    With the slightest turn -- no ill will meant -- 
    my own lesser, yet still somewhat fine-wrought,
    fiery-tempered, delicate, over-passionate steel.




        _Moonrise_


    Will you glimmer on the sea?
    will you fling your spear-head
    on the shore?
    what note shall we pitch?
    we have a song,
    on the bank we share our arrows;
    the loosed string tells our note:

    O flight,
    bring her swiftly to our song.
    she is great,
    we measure her by the pine trees.




        _At Eleusis_


    _What they did,
    they did for Dionysos,
    for ecstasy's sake:_

    now take the basket,
    think;
    think of the moment you count
    most foul in your life;
    conjure it,
    supplicate,
    pray to it;
    your face is bleak, you retract,
    you dare not remember it:

    stop;
    it is too late.
    the next stands by the altar step,
    a child's face yet not innocent,
    it will prove adequate, but you,
    I could have spelt your peril at the gate,
    yet for your mind's sake,
    though you could not enter,
    wait.

    _What they did,
    they did for Dionysos,
    for ecstasy's sake:_

    Now take the basket basket -- 
    (ah face in a dream,
    did I not know your heart,
    I would falter,
    for each that fares onward
    is my child;
    ah can you wonder
    that my hands shake,
    that my knees tremble,
    I a mortal, set in the goddess' place?)




        _Fragment Forty-one_


    Am I blind alas,
    am I blind?
    I too have followed
    her path.
    I too have bent at her feet.
    I too have wakened to pluck
    amaranth in the straight shaft,
    amaranth purple in the cup,
    scorched at the edge to white.

    Am I blind?
    am I the less ready for her sacrifice?
    am I the less eager to give
    what she asks,
    she the shameless and radiant?

    Am I quite lost,
    I towering above you and her glance,
    walking with swifter pace,
    with clearer sight,
    with intensity
    beside which you two
    are as spent ash?

    Nay, I give back to the goddess the gift
    she tendered me in a moment
    of great bounty.
    I return it. I lay it again
    on the white slab of her house,
    the beauty she cast out
    one moment, careless.

    Nor do I cry out:
    why did I stoop?
    why did I turn aside
    one moment from the rocks
    marking the sea-path?
    Aphrodite, shameless and radiant,
    have pity, turn, answer us.

    Ah no -- though I stumble toward
    her altar-step,
    though my flesh is scorched and rent,
    shattered, cut apart,
    slashed open;
    though my heels press my own wet life
    black, dark to purple,
    on the smooth, rose-streaked
    threshold of her pavement.



    Am I blind alas, deaf too
    that my ears lost all this?
    nay, O my lover,
    shameless and still radiant,
    I tell you this:

    I was not asleep,
    I did not lie asleep on those hot rocks
    while you waited.
    I was not unaware when I glanced
    out toward the sea
    watching the purple ships.

    I was not blind when I turned.
    I was not indifferent when I strayed aside
    or loitered as we three went
    or seemed to turn a moment from the path
    for that same amaranth.

    I was not dull and dead when I fell
    back on our couch at night.
    I was not indifferent when I turned
    and lay quiet.
    I was not dead in my sleep.




    Lady of all beauty,
    I give you this:
    say I have offered small sacrifice,
    say I am unworthy your touch,
    but say not:
    she turned to some cold, calm god,
    silent, pitiful, in preference.

    Lady of all beauty,
    I give you this:
    say not:
    she deserted my altar-step,
    the fire on my white hearth
    was too great,
    she fell back at my first glance.

    Lady, radiant and shameless,
    I have brought small wreaths,
    (they were a child's gift,)
    I have offered myrrh-leaf,
    crisp lentisk,
    I have laid rose-petal
    and white rock-rose from the beach.

    But I give now a greater,
    I give life and spirit with this.
    I render a grace
    no one has dared to speak,
    lest men at your altar greet him
    as slave, callous to your art;
    I dare more than the singer
    offering her lute,
    the girl her stained veils,
    the woman her swathes of birth,
    or pencil and chalk,
    mirror and unguent box.

    I offer more than the lad
    singing at your steps,
    praise of himself,
    his mirror his friend's face,
    more than any girl,
    I offer you this:
    (grant only strength
    that I withdraw not my gift,)
    I give you my praise and this:
    the love of my lover
    for his mistress.




        _Telesila_

    _In Argos -- that statue of her;
    at her feet the scroll of her
    love-poetry, in her hand a helmet._


    War is a fevered god
    who takes alike
    maiden and king and clod,
    and yet another one,
    (ah withering peril!)
    deprives alike,
    with equal skill,
    alike indifferently,
    hoar spearsman of his shaft,
    wan maiden of her zone,
    even he,
    Love who is great War's
    very over-lord.

    War bent
    and kissed the forehead,
    yet Love swift,
    planted on chin
    and tenderest cyclamen lift
    of fragrant mouth,
    fevered and honeyed breath,
    breathing o'er and o'er
    those tendrils of her hair,
    soft kisses
    like bright flowers.

    Love took
    and laid the sweet,
    (being extravagant,)
    on lip and chin and cheek,
    but ah he failed
    even he,
    before the luminous eyes
    that dart
    no suave appeal,
    alas, impelling me
    to brave incontinent,
    grave Pallas' high command.

    And yet the mouth!
    ah Love ingratiate,
    how was it you,
    so poignant, swift and sure,
    could not have taken all
    and left me free,
    free to desert the Argives,
    let them burn,
    free yet to turn
    and let the city fall:
    yea, let high War
    take all his vengeful way,
    for what am I?
    I cannot save nor stay
    the city's fall.

    War is a fevered god,
    (yet who has writ as she
    the power of Love?)
    War bent and kissed the forehead,
    that bright brow,
    ignored the chin
    and the sweet mouth,
    for that and the low laugh were his,
    Eros ingratiate,
    who sadly missed
    in all the kisses count,
    those eyebrows
    and swart eyes,
    O valiant one
    who bowed
    falsely and vilely trapped us,
    traitorous lord.

    And yet,
    (remembrance mocks,)
    should I have bent the maiden
    to a kiss?
    Ares the lover
    or enchanting Love?
    but had I moved
    I feared
    for that astute regard;
    for that bright vision,
    how might I have erred?
    I might have marred and swept
    another not so sweet
    into my exile;
    I might have kept a look
    recalling many and many a woman's look,
    not this alone,
    astute, imperious, proud.

    And yet
    I turn and ask
    again, again, again,
    who march to death,
    what was it worth,
    reserve and pride and hurt?
    what is it worth
    to such as I
    who turn to meet
    the invincible Spartans'
    massed and serried host?
    what had it cost, a kiss?




        _Fragment Sixty-eight_



    I envy you your chance of death,
    how I envy you this.
    I am more covetous of him
    even than of your glance,
    I wish more from his presence
    though he torture me in a grasp,
    terrible, intense.

    Though he clasp me in an embrace
    that is set against my will
    and rack me with his measure,
    effortless yet full of strength,
    and slay me
    in that most horrible contest,
    still, how I envy you your chance.

    Though he pierce me -- imperious -- 
    iron -- fever -- dust -- 
    though beauty is slain
    when I perish,
    I envy you death.

    What is beauty to me?
    has she not slain me enough,
    have I not cried in agony of love,
    birth, hate,
    in pride crushed?

    What is left after this?
    what can death loose in me
    after your embrace?
    your touch,
    your limbs are more terrible
    to do me hurt.

    What can death mar in me
    that you have not?




    What can death send me
    that you have not?
    you gathered violets,
    you spoke:
    your hair is not less black,
    nor less fragrant,
    nor in your eyes is less light,
    your hair is not less sweet
    with purple in the lift of lock;
    why were those slight words
    and the violets you gathered
    of such worth?

    How I envy you death;
    what could death bring,
    more black, more set with sparks
    to slay, to affright,
    than the memory of those first violets,
    the chance lift of your voice,
    the chance blinding frenzy
    as you bent?




    So the goddess has slain me
    for your chance smile
    and my scarf unfolding
    as you stooped to it;
    so she trapped me
    with the upward sweep of your arm
    as you lifted the veil,
    and the swift smile and selfless.

    Could I have known?
    nay, spare pity,
    though I break,
    crushed under the goddess' hate,
    though I fall beaten at last,
    so high have I thrust my glance
    up into her presence.

    Do not pity me, spare that,
    but how I envy you
    your chance of death.




        _Lethe_


    Nor skin nor hide nor fleece
    Shall cover you,
    Nor curtain of crimson nor fine
    Shelter of cedar-wood be over you,
        Nor the fir-tree
        Nor the pine.

    Nor sight of whin nor gorse
        Nor river-yew,
    Nor fragrance of flowering bush,
    Nor wailing of reed-bird to waken you,
        Nor of linnet,
        Nor of thrush.

    Nor word nor touch nor sight
        Of lover, you
    Shall long through the night but for this:
    The roll of the full tide to cover you
        Without question,
        Without kiss.




        _Sitalkas_


    Thou art come at length
    more beautiful
    than any cool god
    in a chamber under
    Lycia's far coast,
    than any high god
    who touches us not
    here in the seeded grass:
    aye, than Argestes
    scattering the broken leaves.




        _Hermonax_


    Gods of the sea;
    Ino,
    leaving warm meads
    for the green, grey-green fastnesses
    of the great deeps;
    and Palemon,
    bright seeker of sea-shaft,
    hear me.

    Let all whom the sea loves,
    come to its altar front,
    and I
    who can offer no other sacrifice to thee
    bring this.

    Broken by great waves,
    the wavelets flung it here,
    this sea-gliding creature,
    this strange creature like a weed,
    covered with salt foam,
    torn from the hillocks of rock.

    I, Hermonax,
    caster of nets,
    risking chance,
    plying the sea craft,
    came on it.

    Thus to sea god,
    gift of sea wrack;
    I, Hermonax, offer it
    to thee, Ino,
    and to Palemon.




        _Orion Dead_


(Artemis speaks.)

    The cornel-trees
    uplift from the furrows,
    the roots at their bases,
    strike lower through the barley-sprays.

    So arise and face me.
    I am poisoned with the rage of song.

      I once pierced the flesh
      of the wild deer,
      now I am afraid to touch
      the blue and the gold-veined hyacinths?

      I will tear the full flowers
      and the little heads
      of the grape-hyacinths,
      I will strip the life from the bulb
      until the ivory layers
      lie like narcissus petals
      on the black earth.

      Arise,
      lest I bend an ash-tree
      into a taut bow,
      and slay -- and tear
      all the roots from the earth.

      The cornel-wood blazes
      and strikes through the barley-sprays
      but I have lost heart for this.

      I break a staff,
      I break the tough branch.
      I know no light in the woods.
      I have lost pace with the wind.




        _Charioteer_

     _In that manner_ (_archaic_) _he finished the statue of his
     brother. It stands mid-way in the hall of laurels ... between the
     Siphnians' offering and the famous tripod of Naxos._


    Only the priest
    of the inmost house
    has such height,
    only the faun
    in the glade
    such light, strong ankles,
    only the shade of the bay-tree
    such rare dark
    as the darkness
    caught under the fillet
    that covers your brow,
    only the blade
    of the ash-tree
    such length, such beauty
    as thou,
    O my brother;
    and only the gods
    have such love
    as I bring you;
    but now,
    taut with love,
    more than any bright lover,
    I vowed
    to the innermost
    god of the temple,
    this vow.

    God of beauty, I cried,
    as the four stood alert,
    awaiting the shout
    at the goal
    to be off;
    god of beauty,
    I cried to that god,
    if he merit the laurel,
    I dedicate all of my soul
    to you; to you
    all my strength and my power;
    if he merit the bay,
    I will fashion a statue
    of him, of my brother,
    out of thought,
    and the strength of my wrist
    and the fire of my brain;
    I will strive night and day
    till I mould from the clay,
    till I strike from the bronze,
    till I conjure the rock,
    the chisle, the tool,
    to embody this image;
    an image to startle,
    to capture men's hearts,
    to make all other bronze,
    all art to come after,
    a mock,
    all beauty to follow,
    a shell that is empty;
    I'll stake all my soul
    on that beauty,
    till God shall awake
    again in men's hearts,
    who have said he is dead,
    our King and our Lover.

    Then the start,
    ah the sight,
    ah but dim, veiled with tears,
    (so Achilles must weep
    who finds his friend dead,)
    will he win?
    then the ring of the steel
    as two met at the goal,
    entangled and foul,
    misplaced at the start,
    who, who blunders? not you?
    what omens are set?
    alas, gods of the track,
    what ill wreaks its hate,
    speak it clear,
    let me know
    what evil, what fate?
    for the ring of sharp steel
    told two were in peril,
    two, two, one is you,
    already involved
    with the fears of defeat;
    two grazed;
    which must go?

    As the wind,
    Althaia's beauty came;
    as one after a cruel march,
    catches sight,
    toward the cold dusk,
    of the flower
    that's her name-sake,
    strayed apart
    toward the road-dust,
    from the stream
    in the wood-depth,
    so I in that darkness,
    my mouth bitter
    with sheer loss,
    took courage,
    my heart spoke,
    remembering how she spoke:
    I will seek hour by hour
    fresh cones, resin
    and pine-flowers,
    flower of pine,
    laurel flower;
    I will pray:
    `let him come
    back to us,
    to our home,
    with the trophy of zeal,
    with the love and the proof
    of the favour of god;
    let him merit the bay.`
    (I expect it,)
    I myself on earth pray
    that our father may pray;
    his voice nearer the gods
    must carry beyond
    my mere mortal prayer:
    `O my father beyond,
    look down and be proud,
    ask this thing
    that we win,
    ask it straight of the gods.`

    Was he glad,
    did he know?
    for the strength
    of his prayer and her prayer
    met me now
    in one flame,
    all my head, all my brow
    was one flame,
    taut and beaten
    and faintly aglow,
    as the wine-cup
    encrusted and beaten and fine
    with the pattern of leaves,
    (so my brow,)
    yet metallic and cool,
    as the gold of the frigid metal
    that circles the heat
    of the wine.

    Then the axel-tree cleft,
    not ours, gods be blest;
    now but three of you left,
    three alert and abreast,
    three -- one streak of what fire?
    three straight for the goal:
    ah defeat,
    ah despair,
    still fate tricked our mares,
    for they swerved,
    flanks quivering and wet,
    as the wind
    at the mid-stretch
    caught and fluttered a white scarf;
    a veil shivering,
    only the fluttering
    of a white band,
    yet unnerved and champing,
    they turned,
    (only knowing the swards of Achaea)
    and he, O my love,
    that stranger,
    his stallions
    stark frenzied and black,
    had taken the inmost course,
    overtook,
    overcame,
    overleapt,
    and crowded you back.

    O those horses
    we loved and we prized;
    I had gathered Alea mint
    and soft branch
    of the vine-stock in flower,
    I had stroked Elaphia;
    as one prays to a woman
    be kind,
    I had prayed Daphnaia;
    I had threatened Orea
    for her trick
    of out-pacing the three,
    even these,
    I had almost despaired
    at her fleet, proud pace,
    O the four,
    O swift mares of Achaea.

    Should I pray them again?
    or the gods of the track?
    or Althaia at home?
    or our father who died for Achaea?
    or our fathers beyond
    who had vanquished the east?
    should I threaten or pray?

    The sun struck the ridge of white marble
    before me:
    white sun on white marble
    was black:
    the day was of ash,
    blind, unrepentant, despoiled,
    my soul cursed the race and the track,
    you had lost.

    _You_, lost at the last?

    Ah fools,
    so you threatened to win?
    ah fools,
    so you knew my brother?

    Greeks all,
    all crafty and feckless,
    even so, had you guessed
    what ran in his veins and mine,
    what blood of Achaea,
    had you dared,
    dared enter the contest,
    dared aspire with the rest?

    You had gained,
    you outleapt them;
    a sudden, swift lift of the reins,
    a sudden, swift, taut grip of the reins,
    as suddenly loosed,
    you had gained.

    When death comes
    I will see
    no vision of after,
    (as some count
    there may be an hereafter,)
    no thought of old lover,
    no girl, no woman,
    neither mother,
    nor yet my father
    who died for Achaea,
    neither God with the harp
    and the sun on His brow,
    but thou,
    O my brother.

    When death comes,
    instead of a vision,
    (I will catch it in bronze)
    you will stand
    as you stood at the end,
    (as the herald announced it,
    proclaiming aloud,
    Achaea has won,)
    in-reining them now,
    so quiet,
    not turning to answer
    the shout of the crowd.




        _The Look-out_


    Better the wind, the sea, the salt
    in your eyes,
    than this, this, this.

    You grumble and sweat;
    my ears are acute
    to catch your complaint,
    almost the sea's roar is less
    than your constant threat
    of back and back to the shore,
    and let us rest.

    You grumble and curse your luck
    and I hear:
    O Lynceus,
    aloft by the prow,
    his head on his arms,
    his eyes half closed,
    almost asleep,
    to watch for a rock,
    (and hardly ever we need
    his `to left` or `to right`)
    let Lynceus have my part,
    let me rest like Lynceus.

    Rest like Lynceus!
    I'd change my fate for yours,
    the very least,
    I'd take an oar with the rest.

    Like Lynceus,
    as if my lot were the best.

    O God, if I could speak,
    if I could taunt the lot
    of the wretched crew,
    with my fate, my work.

    But I may not,
    I may not tell
    of the forms that pass and pass,
    of that constant old, old face
    that leaps from each wave
    to wait underneath the boat
    in the hope that at last she's lost.

    Could I speak,
    I would tell of great mountains
    that flow, great weeds
    that float and float
    to tangle our oars
    if I fail to left, to right;
    where the dolphin leaps
    you saw a sign from the god,
    I saw why he leapt from the deep.

    To right, to left;
    it is easy enough
    to lean on the prow, half asleep,
    and you think,
    no work for Lynceus.
    No work?

    If only you'd let me take an oar,
    if only my back could break with the hurt,
    if the sun could blister my feet,
    pain, pain that I might forget
    the face that just this moment
    passed through the prow
    when you said, asleep.

    Many and many a sight
    if I could speak,
    many and many tales I'd tell,
    many and many a struggle,
    many a death,
    many and many my hurts
    and my pain so great,
    I'd gladly die
    if I did not love the quest.

    Grumble and swear and curse,
    brother, god and the boat,
    and the great waves,
    but could you guess
    what strange terror lurks in the sea-depth,
    you'd thank the gods for the ship,
    the timber and giant oars, god-like,
    and the god-like quest.

    If you could see as I,
    what lurks in the sea-depth,
    you'd pray to the ropes
    and the solid timbers
    like god, like god;

    you'd pray to the oars and your work,
    you'd pray and thank
    the boat for her very self;
    timber and oar and plank
    and sail and the sail-ropes,
    these are beautiful things and great.

    But Lynceus at the prow
    has nothing to do but wait
    till we reach a shoal or some rocks
    and then he has only to lift his arms,
    right, left;
    O brother,
    I'd change my place
    for the worst seat
    in the cramped bench,
    for an oar, for an hour's toil,
    for sweat and the solid floor.

    I'd change my place
    as I sit with eyes half closed,
    if only I could see just the ring
    cut by the boat,
    if only I could see just the water,
    the crest and the broken crest,
    the bit of weed that rises on the crest,
    the dolphin only when he leaps.

    But Lynceus,
    though they cannot guess
    the hurt, though they do not thank
    the oars for the dead peace
    of heart and brain worn out,
    you must wait,
    alert, alert, alert.




        _Odyssey_

    _Muse,
    tell me of this man of wit,
    who roamed long years
    after he had sacked
    Troy's sacred streets._


    All the rest
    who had escaped death,
    returned,
    fleeing battle and the sea;
    only Odysseus,
    captive of a goddess,
    desperate and home-sick,
    thought but of his wife and palace;
    but Calypso,
    that nymph and spirit,
    yearning in the furrowed rock-shelf,
    burned
    and sought to be his mistress;
    but years passed,
    the time was ripe,
    the gods decreed,
    (although traitors plot
    to betray him in his own court,)
    he was to return
    to Ithaca;
    and all the gods pitied him;
    but Poseidon
    steadfast to the last
    hated
    god-like Odysseus.

    The sea-god visited
    a distant folk,
    Ethiopians,
    who at the edge of earth
    are divided into two parts,
    (half watch the sun rise,
    half, the sun set,)
    there the hecatomb
    of slain sheep and oxen
    await his revels:
    and while he rejoiced,
    seated at the feast,
    the rest of the gods
    gathered in the palace of Olympian Zeus;
    and the father of men and of gods spoke thus:
    (for he remembered bright Egisthus,
    slain of Agamemnon's child,
    great Orestes:)

    O you spirits,
    how men hate the gods,
    for they say evil comes of us,
    when they themselves,
    by their own wickedness,
    court peril
    beyond their fate;
    so Egisthus, defiant,
    sought Agamemnon's wife
    and slew Agamemnon
    returning to his own palace,
    though we ourselves
    sent bright Hermes,
    slayer of Argos,
    to warn him
    lest Orestes,
    attaining to man's estate,
    demand his inheritance
    and take vengeance:
    we forbade him to strike the king,
    we warned him to respect his wife:
    but could Hermes
    of gracious aspect,
    subtle with kindly speech,
    thus avert the foul work?

    Then the grey-eyed Athene,
    the goddess, spoke:
    O my father, Kronos begot,
    first among the great,
    his death at least was just,
    so may all perish who err thus;
    but my heart is rent
    for the prudent Odysseus,
    who, exiled from his friends,
    is kept too long distressed
    in an island, sea swept,
    in the sea midst,
    a forest island,
    haunt of a spirit,
    child of Atlas,
    crafty of thought,
    who knows the sea depth,
    who supports the high pillars
    which cut sky from earth;
    it is his child
    who keeps Odysseus
    lamenting with broken heart,
    ceaseless to tempt him
    with soft and tender speech,
    that he forget Ithaca;
    but Odysseus,
    yearning to see but the smoke
    drift above his own house,
    prefers death;
    your heart, is it not touched,
    O Olympian?
    did not Odysseus please you
    when he made sacrifice
    before the Grecian ships
    in great Troy?
    why are you angry, Zeus?

    Then Zeus,
    keeper of the clouds,
    answering her, spoke:
    O my child,
    what quaint words
    have sped your lips,
    for how could I forget
    the god-like Odysseus,
    a spirit surpassing men,
    first to make sacrifice
    to the deathless
    in the sky-space?
    but Poseidon
    girder of earth,
    though yet he spares his life,
    nurtures unending hate;
    he goads him from place to place
    because of the Cyclops
    blinded of Odysseus,
    Polyphemus, half-god,
    greatest of the Cyclops,
    whom the nymph Thoosa,
    child of Phorcys,
    king of the waste sea, begot
    when she lay with Poseidon
    among the shallow rocks:
    but come,
    let us plot
    to reinstate Odysseus,
    and Poseidon must abandon his wrath;
    for what can one god accomplish,
    striving alone
    to defy all the deathless?

    Then the grey-eyed Athene,
    the goddess, spoke:
    O my father, Kronos begot,
    first among the great,
    if then it seems just
    to the highest,
    that Odysseus return
    to his own house,
    let us swiftly send
    Hermes, slayer of Argos,
    your attendant,
    that he state
    to the fair-haired nymph,
    our irrevocable wish,
    that Odysseus,
    valiant of heart,
    be sent back:
    and I will depart to Ithaca,
    to incite his son,
    to put courage in his heart,
    that he call to the market place
    the long-haired Greeks
    and shut his gates
    to the pretendants
    who ceaselessly devour his flocks,
    sheep and horned oxen
    of gentle pace:
    that he strive
    for his father's sake
    and gain favour
    in men's thoughts,
    I will send him to Sparta,
    to Pylos' sandy waste.

    _She spoke
    and about her feet
    clasped bright sandals,
    gold-wrought, imperishable,
    which lift her above sea,
    across the land stretch,
    wind-like,
    like the wind breath._




        _From the Masque_




        _Hyacinth_


    Your anger charms me,
    and yet all the time
    I think of chaste, slight hands,
    veined snow;
    snow craters filled
    with first wild-flowerlets;
    glow of ice-gentian,
    whitest violet;
    snow craters
    and the ice ridge
    spilling light;
    dawn and the lover
    chaste dawn leaves bereft -- 
    I think of these
    and snow-cooled Phrygian wine.

    Your anger charms me subtly
    and I know
    that you would take
    the still hands
    where I'd rest;
    you would despoil
    for very joy of theft;
    list, lady,
    I would give you one last hint:
    quench your red mouth
    in some cold forest lake,
    cover your russet locks
    with arum leaf,
    quench out the colour,
    still the fevered glance,
    cover your want,
    your fire insatiate,
    I can not match your fervour,
    nay, nor still my ache
    with any
    but white hands inviolate.



    Take the red spoil
    of grape and pomegranate,
    the red camellia,
    the most, most red rose;
    take all the garden spills,
    inveterate,
    prodigal spender
    just as summer goes,
    the red scales of the deep in-folded spice,
    the Indian, Persian and the Syrian pink,
    their scent undaunted
    even in that faint,
    unmistakable fragrance
    of the late tuberose,
    (heavy its petals,
    eye-lids of dark eyes
    that open languorous
    and more languorous close -- the east,
    further than scent
    of our wind-smitten isle,)
    take these:

    O lady, take them,
    prodigal
    I cull and offer this and this and these
    last definite whorls
    of clustered peonies,
    the last, the first
    that stained our stainless ledge
    of blue and white
    and the white foam of sea,
    rocks,
    and that strait ledge
    whiter than the rock
    the Parians break
    from their enchanted hill;
    take, lady,
    but leave me with my weed and shell
    and those slight, hovering gull-wings that recall
    silver of far Hymettus' asphodel.



    Take all
    for you have taken everything,
    but do not let me see you taking this;
    Adonis lying spent with Venus' care,
    Adonis dying were a lesser ache
    than this,
    to have even your slightest breath
    breathe in the crystal air
    where he takes breath.

    Take all
    for you have taken everything,
    save the broad ledge of sea
    which no man takes,
    take all
    for you have taken mirth and ease
    and all the small delights
    of simple poets,
    the lilt of rhyme,
    the sway and lift and fall,
    the first spring gold
    your fire has scorched to ash,
    the fresh winds
    that go halt
    where you have passed,
    the Tyrian iris
    I so greatly loved,
    its dark head speared
    through its wet spray of leaves.

    Take all,
    but ah, lady, a fool, a poet
    may even know when you have taken all:
    up on the mountain slope
    one last flower cleaves
    to the wet marge of ice,
    the blue of snow,
    keep all your riot
    in the swales below,
    of grape and autumn,
    take all, taking these,
    for you and autumn yet
    can not prevail
    against that flame, that flower,
    (ice, spark or jewel,)
    the cyclamen,
    parting its white cyclamen leaves.



    O, I am ill with dust
    as you with stain,
    O, I am worthless,
    weary, world-bedragged,
    nevertheless to mountains
    still the rain
    falls on the tangle
    of dead under-brush,
    freshens the loam,
    the earth and broken leaves
    for that hoar-frost
    of later star or flower,
    the fragile host
    of Greek anemones.

    Say I am little meet
    to call the youth,
    say I have little magic
    to enchant,
    but is that reason
    why your flaring will
    should sweep and scorch,
    should lap and seethe and fill
    with last red flame
    the tender ditch and runnel
    which the spring freshet
    soon must fill again?

    White violets
    have no place
    on your hot brow;
    how can I bring you
    what the spring must bring?
    what can I offer?
    lush and heady mallow?
    the fire-grass
    or the serpent-spotted
    fire-flower?
    O take them,
    for I stand a ruinous cloud
    between you
    and the chaste uplifted hill.

    O take them swiftly
    and more swiftly go,
    for spring is distant yet,
    for spring is far;
    you have your tense, short space
    of blazing sun,
    your melons, vines,
    your terraces of fruit;
    now all you have,
    all, all I gladly give
    who long but for the ridge,
    the crest and hollow,
    the lift and fall,
    the reach and distant ledge
    of the sun-smitten,
    wind-indented snow.




        _The bird-choros of Ion_


    Birds from Parnassus,
    swift
    you dart
    from the loftiest peaks;
    you hover, dip,
    you sway and perch
    undaunted on the gold-set cornice;
    you eagle,
    god's majestic legate,
    who tear, who strike
    song-birds in mid-flight,
    my arrow whistles toward you,
    swift
    be off;

    ah drift,
    ah drift
    so soft, so light,
    your scarlet foot so deftly placed
    to waft you neatly
    to the pavement,
    swan, swan
    and do you really think
    your song
    that tunes the harp of Helios,
    will save you
    from the arrow-flight?
    turn back,
    back
    to the lake of Delos;

    lest all the song notes
    pause and break
    across a blood-stained throat
    gone songless,
    turn back,
    back
    ere it be too late,
    to wave-swept Delos.

    Alas, and still another,
    what?
    you'd place your mean nest
    in the cornice?
    sing, sing
    my arrow-string,
    tell to the thief
    that plaits its house
    for fledglings
    in the god's own house,
    that still the Alpheus
    whispers sweet
    to lure
    the birdlets to the place,
    that still the Isthmus
    shines with forests;
    on the white statues
    must be found
    no straw nor litter
    of bird-down,
    Phoebos must have his portal fair;

    and yet, O birds,
    though this my labour
    is set,
    though this my task is clear,
    though I must slay you,
    I, god's servant,
    I who take here
    my bread and life
    and sweep the temple,
    still I swear
    that I would save you,
    birds or spirits,
    winged songs
    that tell to men god's will;

    still, still
    the Alpheus whispers clear
    to lure the bird-folk
    to its waters,
    ah still
    the Isthmus
    blossoms fair;
    lest all the song notes
    pause and break
    across a blood-stained throat
    gone songless,
    turn back,
    back
    ere it be too late,
    to wave-swept Delos.


The sleeping beauty
Edith Sitwell

THE SLEEPING BEAUTY

WHEN we come to that dark house,
Never sound of wave shall rouse
The bird that sings within the blood
Of those who sleep in that deep wood.
For in that house the shadows now
Seem cast by some dark unknown bough.
The gardener plays his old bagpipe
To make the melons' gold seeds ripe;
The music swoons with a sad sound -- 
"Keep, my lad, to the good safe ground !
For once, long since, there was a felon
With guineas gold as the seeds of a melon,
And he would sail for a far strand
To seek a waking, clearer land, -- 
A land whose name is only heard
In the strange singing of a bird.
The sea was sharper than green grass,
The sailors would not let him pass,
For the sea was wroth and rose at him
Like the turreted walls of Jerusalem,

Or like the towers and gables seen
Within a deep-boughed garden green.
And the sailors bound and threw him down
Among those wrathful towers to drown.
And oh, far best," the gardener said,
"Like fruits to lie in your kind bed, --- 
To sleep as snug as in the grave
In your kind bed, and shun the wave,
Nor ever sigh for a strange land
And songs no heart can understand."
I hunted with the country gentlemen
Who, seeing Psyche fly, thought her a hen
And aimed at her; the mocking winged one
Laughed at their wingless state, their
crooked gun.
Then on the water -- green and jewelled leaves
Hiding ripe fruitage, every sportsman grieves,
Sitting and grumbling in their flat boat
edged
With the soft feathers of the foam, scarce
fledged.

But I will seek again the palace in the wood,
Where never bird shall rouse our sleepy blood
Within the bear-dark forests, far beyond
This hopeless hunting, or Time's sleepy
bond.
The gardener was old as tongues of nightingales
That in the wide leaves tell a thousand
Grecian tales
And sleep in golden nets of summer light.
"Sweet fig," he called me, and would stay
the flight
Of plums that seemed Jove's golden-feathered
rain.
Then birds like Fortunatus moved again
Among the boughs with silent feathered
feet,_
Spraying down dew like jewels amid the sweet
Green darkness; figs, each like a purse of
gold,
Grow among leaves like rippled water green
and cold.

"Beneath those laden boughs," the gardener
sighs,
"Dreaming in endlessness, forgotten beauty
lies.
Long since, a wandering and airy nymph
She seemed, when the bright ladies of the
COurt
Came like the sylvan equipage Dian
Leads in her hunting through the deepest
woods
And the Dodonian leaves of summer; only
nOW
We see them smile, an echo through dim
leaves."
Thus spoke the ancient man, wrinkled like
old moonlight
Beneath dark boughs. Time dreamed away
to night,
And while I heard the leaves like silver
cymbals ring
He told me this old tale of Beauty's mournful
christening -- 

Oh the pomp that passed those doors;
Trains still sweep the empty floors,
Pelongs, bulchauls, pallampores,
Soundless now as any breeze
Of amber and of orangeries
That sweep from isles in Indian seas;
While in the floating and mysterious leaves
A silver sound like some forgotten music
grieves.
The fairies all received an invitation,
Ordered their sedan-chairs with great elation,
Their richest trains, their plumes, and their
bright trumps
Like silver fruits that from dark branches
grow in clumps.
The fays descend from each dark palanquin
With fanfares and with lute sounds, walk
within
The shade; there, smiling dim as satyr-broods
Horned as moons, that haunt our deepest
woods,

Are country gentlemen, so countrified
That in their rustic grace they try to hide
Their fingers sprouting into leaves; we see
Them sweet as cherries growing from a tree -- 
All fire and snow; they grow and never move,
Each in the grace of his Pan-haunted grove.
"Her mouth," the first fay said, "as fair
shall be
As any gentle ripe red strawberry
That grows among the thickest silver leaves;
Her locks shall be as blonde as these -- the eve's
Great winds of beauty, fleeces from those
flocks
That Dian tends in her deep woods, those
locks
Shall seem." The second fairy said,
"Blessings like dew fall on her lovely head
For lovely as the cherubim's soft breath
Or Leda's love, whose cold melodious death
Is heavenly music to the sad world lost,
Her skin shall be, as fair as silver frost."
But now within the dark shade of a deep-dreaming tree
A darker shade and panoply we see ;
Drowning the soft sound of the plashing lute
A great fanfare is heard, like unripe silver
fruit.
"Who is this now who comes : " Dark words
reply and swoon
Through all the high cold arbours of the
moon :
"The slighted Laidronette, the unbidden
fay,
Princess of the Pagodas. . . . Shades, make
way !"
The sedan-chair that hides her shade is
mellow
As the trees' great fruit-jewels glittering
yellow,

And round it the old turbanned ladies flock
Like apes that try to pluck an apricock.
The little fawning airs are trembling wan;
And silver as fair Leda's love the swan
The moonlight seems; the apricocks have
turned to amber,
Cold as from the bright nymph Thetis'
chamber,
And far away, the fountains sigh forlorn
As waving rustling sheaves of silver corn.
The wicked fay descended, mopping, mowing
In her wide-hooped petticoat, her water-flowing
Brightly-perfumed silks. . . . "Ah ha, I
See
You have remembered all the fays but me !"
(She whipped her panthers, golden as the
shade
Of afternoon in some deep forest glade.)

"I am very cross because I am old,
And my tales are told
And my flames jewel-cold.
I will make your bright birds scream
I will darken your jewelled dream,
I will spoil your thickest cream,
I will turn the cream sour,
I will darken the bower,
I will look through the darkest shadows and
lour, -- 
And sleep as dark as the shade of a tree
Shall cover you. . . . Don't answer me !
For if the Princess prick her finger
Upon a spindle, then she shall be lost
As a child wandering in a glade of thorn
With sleep like roses blowing soft, forlorn,
Upon each bough. This, madam, is the cost
Of your dark rudeness. But I will not linger."
And with a dark dream's pomp and panoply
She swept out with her train; the soft
sounds die
Of plumaged revelry bright as her train
Of courtiers; and all was night again.

Then through the deepest shades went
Laidronette, -- 
Princess of the Pagodas; in a pet
She left the domes, like rich and turbanned
fruits
In the great gardens, and she left the lutes ;
Back to her palace in her great sedan
She floats; world turn to snow before her
fan -- 
She sweeps through the dark woods to her
vast palace
Where now, at last, she can unleash her
malice.
There in her room, an amber orange burned
On the Hesperides' dark trees and spurned
By that gold-peruked conqueror the Sun -- 
An Alexander whence plumed rivers run
Fearing his fierceness, Ethiopian shapes
The heat had kissed, with lips like burning
grapes, -- 
Unwigged her for the night, while her apes
beg
That she will leave uncurtained that Roc's
egg

Her head, a mount of diamonds bald and big
In the ostrich feathers that compose her wig.
Her dwarfs as round as oranges of amber
Among the tall trees of the shadow clamber
And in Night's deep domain she monstrous
lies
With every little wicked dream that flies
And crawls ; with old Bacchantes black with
wine, -- 
Whose very hair has changed into a vine,
And ancient satyrs whose wry wig of roses
Nothing but little rotting shames discloses.
They lie where shadows, cold as the night
breeze,
Seem cast by rocks, and never by kind trees.


NExt dawn, the ancient chamberlain
Came like someone who has lain
For years beneath the deepest water. . . .
He called the housekeeper's young daughter
Where she sat in her bedgown
Smoothing the dusky dawn's owl-down,
Until she leaned out through the wet
Leaves in her pale sarcenet.
"Forget the dawn is still owl-dark,
Forget the wet leaves . . . you must hark:
Owing to the fairy's malice,
No spindles must be in the palace."
In their dark leaf-hid bower the maidens
chatter like a bird
Awakening: "Phoebe, Audrey, have you
heard
Oh, the dark panic here this very night,
The slighted fairy's anger and our good
queen's fright,


And all our spindles banished! it would seem
That we have naught to do all day but
dream! ?"
When the dew seems like trembling silver
leaves,
Cross Poll Troy looks out through the palace
eaves. . . .
"Knot up your butter-yellow satin hair,
You lazy queans. . . . Come quick! come
down the stair!
Anne, Anne,
Come draw the milk!
The cream must be as thick as silk
And yellow as the ripest sheen
Of apricock or nectarine.
Beneath the great leaves of that tree
Wicked Goat-foot I can see .
He'll steal the milk and steal the cream
While you lie in a lazy dream.
Fie, the lazy birds, the shames!
Phoebe, you must light the flames;
They will spring like greenest leaves
Growing round your bower's dim eaves.

Oh the foliage shrill and green
In the fire! you lazy quean,
Dream not of your heart's desire,
Phoebe, come and light the fire!`"


THEN through the broad green leaves the
gardener came
With a basket filled with honeyed fruits of
dawn
Plucked from the thickest leaves. They
heard him sing
As he walked where that pillared avenue
Of tall clear-fruited ripe trees grew
(For so the Palace seemed); and sweet
His song fled, soft as wind and fleet :
"Now the dawn, lights seem
Ripe yellow fruits in a dream
Among the great green leaves
Of dawn and rustling sheaves.
The vast sun's rays like sheaves of wheat
Are gold and dry,
All bound together, growing yet -- 
An early offering. I
Heard the old King's lullabies
That his nurse the South Wind sighs
As she heaps the honeycombs
Where he lies; the fruit-ripe domes



All around him, clear and sweet. . . .
And now the old King's cockscomb crown
Is nodding, falls a-down, a-down. . . .
Till the golden sheaves of the sun shall be
mown
He will lie in the palace above the wheat.
The dew all tastes of ripening leaves;
Dawn's tendril fingers heap
The yellow honeyed fruits whose clear
Sound flows into his sleep.
Those yellow fruits and honeycomb. . . .
"Lulla-lullaby,` -- 
Shrilled the dew on the broad leaves -- 
Time itself must die -- 
( -- must die).
Now in the palace the maidens knead
And bake the little loaves of the bread,
Gold as the sun; they sighing said,
"When will the sun begin to seed
And waken the old Dead -- 
(cold Dead)


Do, do,
Princess, do,
The fairy Chatte Blanche rocks you slow.
Like baskets of white fruit or pearls
Are the fairy's tumbling curls,
Or lattices of roses white
Wherethrough the snows like doves take
flight.
Do, do,
Princess, do,
How furred and white is the fallen snow.
Do, do,
Princess, do,
Like singing blackbirds are the eyes
Of the fairy old and wise.
A honeyed tune, the crystal drops
Of rain that falls and never stops
From flowers as white as seraphims'
Breath no winter ever dims. . . .
Do, do,
Princess, do,
Like birds that peck fruit sweet and shrill
With painted bill,
Flies down the snow.

The angels came with footsteps light,
They brushed her hair to make it bright,
They taught her to be sweet and wise
With kisses faint as butterflies.
They said, "When you go up to heaven
The nursery clock shall ne'er strike seven.
Your boudoir shall be of white satin,
You shall not say your prayers in Latin -- 
But you shall dance a minuet
On heaven's floors; frizzed mignonette
Shall seem your curls, of heaven's flowers
Most fair; and you shall sit in bowers
Of honeysuckle sweet as those pink fires
Whereby the angels dry their locks upon the
lights' gold wires."
And when the Queen called for her child,
they brought
Only her image, formed to please the
Court. . . .
An old man with a gardener's hat and red
Poll-parrot nose brought her a tiny bed

Whereon lies folded a small poppet rose
That in her dark leaves like a little babe lies
close.
For after Laidronette's wild rage was spent,
The chamberlain to the child's nursery went
And sped her far away, like the East Wind,
To worlds of snow, far from the fairy's mind.
And there the Princess stayed till she was
weaned
From milk of doves ; then o'er the snow
bright-preened
By its sharp bill the wind, the chamberlain
Whisked the Princess back to the Court again.


BUT the Dowager Queen shook her old head :
"The rose, the peach, and the quince-flower
red
And the strawberry flower in the snows are
dead.
If none of the rose-tribe can survive
The snow, then how can our poppet live : "
And in her gown of quilted satin,
As red as quince-flowers, she reads Latin
Missals to the peaches that grow
Gilded with suns, then fade like snow ;
They lie in the nets of dew at leisure.
And this is now her only pleasure -- 
This and her parrot long ago
Dead, but none dared tell her so,
And therefore the bird was stuffed and
restored
To lifeless immortality; bored
It seemed, but yet it remained her own;
And she never knew the bird's soul had
flown.

And so indeed seemed Destiny,
A bird fine-feathered, fair to see
In spite of its condor-wings, fierce beak,
And hooded eyes. . . . Grown old and
weak,
Imprisoned now in a gilded cage
In her powder-closet, far from the rage
Of winter, it can only sing
Roulades and preen its bright clipped wing
Upon her perfumed dressing table
In a cage with a foolish bell-hung gable,
Beneath the portrait of dead Queen Anne
(Whose life was the sweet air blown from a
fan),
'Midst brightly perfumed water-flowing
Eighteenth-century silks where growing
Strawberry flowers of the frail frost
Upon the diamond-panes are lost.


At Easter when red lacquer buds sound far
slow
Quarter-tones for the old dead Mikado,
Through avenues of lime trees, where the
wind
Sounds like a chapeau chinois, shrill,
unkind, -- 
The Dowager Queen, a curling Korin wave
That flows for ever past a coral cave
With Dido Queen of Carthage slowly drives
(Her griffin dog that has a thousand lives)
Upon the flat-pearled and fantastic shore
Where curled and turbanned waves sigh
"Nevermore,"
And she is sunk beneath a clear still lake
Of sleep, so frail with age she cannot
wake. . . .
A strange horizon and a soundless sea
Must separate wise age from you and me -- 

They watch life's movements ripening like
fruit
And sigh, knowing the gnarled and twisted
root.
O people building castles on the sand
And taking one another by the hand,
What do you find within each other's eyes -- 
What wisdom unknown of the lonely wise -- 
The promise of what spring, the certainty
Of what eternal life to come, what lie
Only the sound of Time's small muffled drum,
The sound of footsteps that will never come,
And little marches all beribboned gay
That lead down the lime avenues away
To the dark grave . . . we for a little weep,
Then pray a little, sinking into sleep.
How far is this wise age from the bright
youth
Of Princess Cydalise, a warm wind from the
south :



In the great nursery where the poppet maids
Seem small round fruits that grow in leafy
glades,
The Princess grew in beauty till she seemed
That gentle maid of whom Endymion
dreamed.
And in those evenings when the lovely moon
Shone through the smiling woods of deepest
June,
Then through the curtains she would play
"Bo-Peep"
With fleecy lamb-tailed clouds, when she
should sleep.
Sometimes the moon would sing her ancient
songs
Of lovely ladies and forgotten wrongs ;
And once she whispered that within the
wood
An ancient satyr, wiser than the brood

From which he sprang, within a cloudy cave
Teaches philosophies both old and grave.
The Princess said, "With my light step I
will be gone
To peep within that far cave -- but alone !"
Yet in the darkness, her gazelle-light foot-steps ran
Far from the cave of that wise satyr-man.

In the great gardens, after bright spring rain,
We find sweet innocence come once again,
White periwinkles, little pensionnaires
With muslin gowns and shy and candid airs,
That under saint-blue skies with gold stars
SOWn
Hide their sweet innocence by spring winds
blown,
From zephyr libertines that like Richelieu
And d'Orsay their gold-spangled kisses blew ;
And lilies of the valley whose buds blonde and
tight
Seem curls of little school-children that light
The priests' procession, when on some saint's
day
Along the country paths they make their way.
Forget-me-nots, whose eyes of childish blue,
Gold-starred like heaven, speak of love still
true ;
And all the flowers that we call "dear heart,"
Who say their prayers like children, then
depart

Into the dark. Amid the dew's bright beams
The summer airs like Weber waltzes fall
Round the first rose who flushed with her
youth seems
Like young Princesses dressed for their first
ball:
Who knows what beauty ripens from dark
mould
After the sad wind and the winter's cold -- 
But a small wind sighed, colder than the rose
Blooming in desolation, "No one knows."

The Princess was young as the innocent
flowers
That bloom and love through the bright
spring hours.
Sometimes she crept through locked doors to
annoy
The palace housekeeper, cross Mrs. Troy,
Who kept all the whimpering sad ghosts
locked
In a cupboard, was grieved and faintly
shocked
If the Princess Jehanne, long since dead,
Whose hair was of costly long gold thread,
Would slip her flat body, like a gleaming
Quivering fish in a clear pool dreaming,
Through the deep mesh of a conversation,
Making some ghostly imputation; -- 
Or if she frightened the maids till they wince
By stealing a withered gold-crowned quince
Wherewith they make preserves; in the
gloom
She seems, as she glimmers round the room,
Like a lovely milk-white unicorn
In a forestial thicket of thorn.

Life was so still, so clear, that to wake
Under a kingfisher's limpid lake
In the lovely afternoon of a dream
Would not remote or stranger seem.
Everything seemed so clear for a while -- 
The turn of a head or a deep-seen smile,
Then a smile seen through wide leaves or
deep water,
That beauty seemed to the King's daughter;
For a flying shadow passed, then gone
Was the gleam, and the Princess was alone.
How sweet seemed the flowers of spring
again -- 
As pink as Susan and Polly and Jane,
Like country maids so sweet and shy
Who bloom and love and wonder not why:
Now when summer comes it seems the
door
To the graves that lie under the trivial floor,
And the gardens hard to touch and shining,
Where no mirage dew lies whining.
And the sweet flowers seem for a fading while
Dear as our first love's youthful smile,
Till they bruise and wound the heart and sense
With their lost and terrible innocence.

WHEN each clear raindrop holds for flight
A wingless world all plumage-bright
Like crystal-clear wysteria,
After the storm's hysteria,
The Princess visited the farm
Where all the beasts lie, furred as palm
That on the budding Easter boughs
Among the winds of beauty grows.
The farm-pond, fruitish-soft and ripe,
Was smooth as a daguerreotype;
The farm-maid, Rosa, under flimsy
Muslin skies, an angel's whimsy,
Walked. . . . Her daisy-frilled frock
Was stiff and harder than a rock,
Frills touch her feet, like plants foam down ;
Her wooden trellised hair is brown.
The grass is furry as a bear
With heat; the donkey's panniers flare

With fruits whose clear complexions waxen
Hide in leaves all hairy-flaxen.
And from the sky, white angels lean
To stroke poor Dobbin's palm-furred skin,
And pluck from the round leaves the pink
Schoolgirlish summer fruits that wink -- 
Giggle insipidly. On winding
Roads whose dust seems gilded binding
Made for "Paul et Virginie" -- 
(So flimsy-tough those roads are), see
The panniered donkey pass. The ass's
Thoughts as through the dust he passes
Where leaves seem parasols of gauze
Shading the striped wooden floors,
Seem like this : "When long ago
I worked for Balaam, never so
Appeared an angel ! times are stranger
Now," and turning to his manger

He longs, for loads have made him weary,
For gentian stars, all rough and hairy,
And trees that bear white satin streamers
Of lovely flowers to please poor dreamers.
The Princess passed goats gold as wheat
With a kind white milky bleat,
Under the wide leaves mild as milk;
The billowing pigs with ears of silk;
Maternal cows with a white horn
As hard and dry as rustling corn -- 
All the poor shadows cast by our sad earthly
dress
Of faults and virtues, wavering childishness


WHEN we were young, how beautiful life
seemed ! -- 
The boundless bright horizons that we
dreamed,
And the immortal music of the Day and
Night
Leaving the echo of their wonder and their
might
Deep in our hearts and minds. How could
the dust
Of superstitions taught in schoolrooms, lust
In love's shape, dim our beauty : What
dark lie
Or cruelty's voice, could drown this God-made harmony
For we knew naught of prison-worlds man
built
Around us that we may not know man's
guilt,
The endless vistas of the goatish faces
Echoing each other, and the basis


Of clay, the plumeless wings of Destiny,
The vistas leading only to the grave where
we must lie.
Then all the beauty of the world lay deep
Mirrored within the beauty water-clear
Of flowering boughs; Helen and Deirdre
dreamed
And fading, wakened in that loveliness
Of watery branches. In that dead wild
spring
Through the bird's shaken voice we heard
God sing.
But age has dimmed our innocent paradise
With a faint shadow, shaken dust within
our eyes,
And we are one now with the lonely wise,
Knowing the spring is only the clear mirage
Of an eternal beauty that is not.
Those were the days when the fleet summer
seemed
The warmth and infinite loveliness of God,
Who cared for us, within a childish heaven.
We could believe then! Oh the lips and eyes
That spoke of some far undimmed paradise!
Those were the days. . . .

Now that the summer only seems the sad
Mechanical dull action of the light
And shadow playing over a dead world -- 
Dead as my heart -- it seems too long ago
For the remembrance of the beauty and the
world we used to know.
When the warm lights of afternoon were
mellow
As honeyed yellow pears, the Princess played
At Troy Town in the palace garden, tossed
And through the smiling leaves of summer
lost
A round compact gold ball, the smaller image
Of this hard world, grown dry of any love,
Or walked upon the shore, watched the
fantastic
Arabesque, the horsemanship of waves.
"Mademoiselle Fantoche, where do they
go?"
A faint cold wind replied, "I do not know."
THE PRINCESS
"Upon the infinite shore by the sea
The lovely ladies are walking like birds.

Their gowns have the beauty, the feathery
Grace of a bird's soft raiment; remote
Is their grace and their distinction,-they
float
And peck at their deep and honeyed words
As though they were honeyed fruits; and
this
Is ever their life, between sleep and bliss.
Though they are winged for enchanted flight,
They yet remain ever upon the shore
Of Eternity, seeking for nothing more,
Until the cold airs dull their beauty
And the snows of winter load those dazzling
Wings, and no bird-throat can sing !"
THE GovernANTE
"Look not on the infinite wave,
Dream not of the siren cave,
Nor hear the cold wind in the tree
Sigh of worlds we cannot see.
(Sings)
The hot muscatelle
Siesta time fell,
And the Spanish belle
Looked out through her shutters.


Under the eglantine
Thorny and lean
A shadow was playing a mandoline, mutters
Only this: "Wave
Your fan . . . siren cave
Never was cold as the wind from the grave."
The governante
Came walking andante,_
Sailed like a brigantine, black of brow.
And the falconette
Who danced a ballette
Sang on the pretty, the brunette bough :
"The ambassade
Of shadows invade
Death's most ultimate, peaceful shade. . . .
Lovely lady, where are you now
Come, Madam, you must eat your creamy
curd,
Soft as the plumage of a bird,
Break through the jewelled branches' bird-soft gloom
And find Malinn within the cool still-room."


WHERE reynard-haired Malinn
Walks by rock and cave,
The Sun, a Chinese mandarin,
Came dripping from the wave.
"Your hair seems like the sunrise
O'er Persia and Cathay -- 
A rose-red music strange and dim
As the embalmed smile of seraphim,"
He said to her by the white wave
In the water-pallid day
(A forest of white coral boughs
Seemed the delicate sea-spray):
"In envy of your brighter hair,
Since, Madam, we must quarrel, -- 
I've changed the cold flower-lovely spray
To branches of white coral.
And when, white muslin madam, you
Coquette with the bright wind,
I shall be but thin rose-dust,
He will be cold, unkind."

The flowers that bud like rain and dream
On thin boughs water-clear,
Fade away like a lovely music
Nobody will hear,
And Eolus and Boreas
Brood among those boughs
Like hermits haunting the dark caves
None but the wise man knows.
But Malinn's reynard-coloured hair
Amid the world grown sere
Still seemed the Javanese sunrise
Whose wandering music will surprise
Into cold bird-chattering cries
The Emperor of China
Lying on his bier.

THE birds, strange flashing glints of another
life
Peck at the fruits of summer, that too soon
Will fade into a little gilded dust.
Then underneath the dancing, glancing
bough
Came Malinn, with her round cheeks dyed as
pink
As the insipid empty-tasting fruits
Of summer giggling through the rounded
leaves.
Outside the stillroom was a cherry tree,
And through the dancing shadows she could
See
Cross ancient Poll Troy come to do her
duty. . . .
She had a cold frost-bitten beauty
Like blue moonlight smooth and cold
As amber ; with her trembling old
Hands she tied the boughs aloft
Through the air all creamy soft ;
Then on the sill of the woodland dairy,
Moving as quick and light as a fairy,


She put a bowl of the thickest cream
(As thick as chestnut flowers in a dream).
The gossiping naiad of the water,
In her sprigged gown like the housekeeper's
daughter,
Giggles outside the stillroom ; she
Plucks at the thick-bustled cherry tree.
And Poll is cross ; she chases cherried
Country maids like thickest-berried
Cherry trees in their ruched gown
Till they run from the palace, down,
Like the sprigged muslin waterfalls
Of this clear country, to where calls
Pan, with his satyrs on the rocks
Feeding their wave-weary flocks.
The naiad's giggling irritates
Cross Poll Troy till at last she rates
Her through the thick-leaved cherry
tree :
"My eyes are dim, I yet can see
You, lazy quean! Go work!`" "I can't."
"I say you shall !" "I say I shan't!"
"But when the airs are creamy soft
And candle-flames are quince flowers, oft
Though my heart flutters like a bird
All dream-dark, though as soft as curd

The moonlight seems still, from my bed
I rise and work, you sleepy head!
Though I am dim and very old,
I wake the flames all jewel-cold,
The flames that seem, when they soar high,
Like waterfalls of jewels; you sigh,
While I, Miss, churn and make the curd,"
Piped Poll Troy like a small cross bird,
Then shuts the stillroom window, goes, for she
Still hears the naiad giggling through the
tree.
But Malinn stays where the deep fire's red
flowers
Should be as sweet and red as hawthorn
bowers.
(Sings)
"The purring fire has a bear's dull fur,
Its warmth is sticky, dark as a burr. . . .
Come drowse, for now there is no eye
To watch, no voice to ask me why!
All night I hear my animal blood
Cry to my youth, `Come to the wood` . . .
But Darkness lumbers like a bear,
Grumbling cumbers floor and stair. . . .

And on the eightieth step, I know
That on the moon's green lichen stain
I'll slip . . . and his dark breath will blow
My light out. . . . All will be still again!"
She cried out to the naiad : "I have torn
My flimsy dress upon a thicket's thorn;
The petal of a briar-rose lies forlorn
Upon it." Through the glinting leaves
about the dairy
Appeared the cream-smug face of the wicked
fairy. . . .
"You've torn your dress, my poppet. . . .
I'll come in. . . .
I've brought my spindle with me and I'll spin
A dress for you. . . .
Such grey-blue sleeves
Of muslin, like the wind of eve's.
It shall have frills that flare like leaves.
The ribbons shall be preened,
Quilled prettily and sheened
As when the courtier wind plays with a flock
Of birds for battledore and shuttlecock -- 
Whose feathers stream like ribbons. I will hide
A jewel within each one : you'll seem a bride

For Ariel or some rich water-god. . . .
Come, spin , "
Malinn looked through the leaves. . . .
"Ma'am, please come in "
Far off, the Martha-coloured scabious
Grew among dust as dry as old Eusebius,
And underneath the cotton-nightcap trees
Wanders a little cold pig-snouted breeze.
Then in a gown all frilled with foliage like
hell's fires
And quilled like nests of cockatrices, with the
light's gold wires
Sewing it stiff, old Laidronette the fairy
Crept through the window of the woodland
dairy.
Butter and cream
Turn hard as a jewel,
The shrill flames scream,
The leaves mutter "cruel."

Through the dark jewelled leaves
See the Princess peep
As lovely as eve's
Soft wind of sleep.
She picks up the spindle. "Oh, the curious
bliss . . . -- 
. . . It pricks my finger now. How strange
this is,
For I am like that lovely fawn-queen dead
Long since, -- pierced through the pool-clear
heart," she said.
Her room now seems like some pale cave
Haunted by a goatish wave.
Through the curtains -- waves of water -- 
Comes the housekeeper's young daughter
Where like coral-branches seem
The candles' light, the candles' gleam.
"Does Echo mourn her lost love there ?
Echo is a courtly air

Sighing the name of Cydalise
Beside clear pools of sleep; she sees
Her like a nymph in some deep grot
(Where the wave whispers not)
Like a rose-bush in that cave
Haunted by a goatish wave.

Do, do,
Princess, do,
Like a tree that drips with gold you flow
With beauty ripening very slow.
Soon beneath that peaceful shade
The whole world dreaming will be laid.
Do, do,
Princess, do,
The years like soft winds come and go.
Do, do,
Princess, do,
How river-thick flow your fleeced locks
Like the nymphs' music o'er the rocks. . . .
From satyr-haunted caverns drip
These lovely airs on brow and lip.
Do, do,
Princess, do,
Like a tree that drips with gold you flow.

BUT far from snow-soft sleep, the country
Fair
Spangled like planets the bucolic air
Under hot Capricorn, with gold goat-legs,
Rough satyr hands, that in the sunburnt hay
Pulled the long wind-blown hair of Susans,
Megs,
And under great trees dark as water lay.
It seemed a low-hung country of the blind, -- 
A sensual touch upon the heart and mind.
Like crazy creaking chalets hanging low
From the dark hairiness of bestial skies
The clouds seem, like a potting-shed where
grow
The flower-like planets for the gay flower-show :
Gold-freckled calceolarias,
Marigolds, cinerarias,
African marigolds coarse-frilled
And cherries, apricots, all chilled
With dew, for thus the bright stars seemed
To cottage windows where none dreamed.
But country gentlemen who from their birth
Like kind red strawberries root deep in earth

And sleep as in the grave, dream far beyond
The sensual aspects of the hairy sky
That something hides, they have forgotten
why!
And so they wander, aiming with their gun
At mocking feathered creatures that have
learnt
That movement is but groping into life,
Under rough trees like shepherds' goatish
tentS.
And only Midsummer's wide country Fair
Seems to them heaven and hell and earth and
air.
The people ride in roundabouts; their hair
Is like the gardens of the Pleiades
Or the first impulse from which music
sprung
And the dark sound in the smooth growth of
treeS.

They sparkle like the sea; their love is young
For ever, they are golden as the boy
Who gave an apple smoother than the breeze
To lady Venus lovely as the seas.
Their lips are like the gold fires burning Troy.

Like harsh and crackling rags of laughter
seems
The music, bright flung as an angel's hair -- 
Yet awful as the ultimate despair
Of angels and of devils. . . . Something
dreams
Within the sound that shrieks both high and
low
Like some ventriloquist's bright-painted
show
On green grass, shrill as anger, dulled as
hate :
It shrieks to the dulled soul, "Too late, too
late! ?"
Sometimes it jangles thin as the sharp wires
Whereon the poor half-human puppets move;
Sometimes it flares in foliage like hell's
fires,
Or whispers insincerities for love.
A little hurdy-gurdy valse sounds hollow
And bright-husked as the hearts of passing
people,
Whose talk is only of the growth of plums
And pears : "Life goes, Death never comes,"
They sigh, while the bright music like a wave
Sings of far lands and many a siren cave.

And there are terrible and quick drum-taps
That seem the anguished beat of our own
heart
Making an endless battle without hope
Against materialism and the world.
And sometimes terrible lumbering Darkness
comes
Breaking the trivial matchboard floors that
hide -- 
From us the Dead we dare not look upon :
O childish eyes, O cold and murdered face -- 
Dead innocence and youth that were our
own!
But age has brought a little subtle change
Like the withdrawal caused by the slow
dropping
Of cold sad water on some vast stone
image:
A slow withdrawal, a sad, gradual change
O'er tragic masks through which strange gods
have cried -- 
Till seen through death-cold rents in
saturnine leaves
They seem, almost, to echo in their form
The saturnine cold laughter of the water.

And this, too, is the fate of country masks
Of Comedy, as fresh as smiling fruits
Of summer seen vermilion through deep
leaves.
Now from the countrysides where people
know
That Destiny is wingless and bemired,
With feathers dirty as a hen's, too tired
To fly -- where old pig-snouted Darkness
grovels
For life's mired rags among the broken
hovels -- 
The country bumpkins come, with faces
round
And pink as summer fruits, with hair as
gold
Sharp-pointed as the summer sun (that old
Bucolic mime, whose laughing pantomime
Is rearing pink fruits from the sharp white
rime).
They come from little rooms, each a poor
booth
(Seen through the summer leaves, all smiling
smooth).

There, for all beauty, is the badly painted
Ancestral portrait of their grey-beard God.
In that poor clownish booth it is so cold
That small airs prick like grass, a wooden
sword.
They pass along the country roads as thick
With walls and gardens as a childish heaven,
Where all the flowers seem a pink fleshly
heart
And mirage dews sigh, "We will never
part."
And there are young Princesses at each inn
And poor young people poverty makes wise,
With eyes like maps of the wide summer
heaven.
And on the country roads there is a shrine
As blue and sparkling as the sea-god's wine
For country gods and goddesses of gardens
Where every fruit and flower to old songs
hardens :
Pomona, tinsel-pink as that bright pear
The moon -- she seems a poor bucolic clown
With dry and gilded foliage for her hair,
Where branches cast a shallow melancholy,
An owl-soft shadow falling over folly.

The pink schoolgirlish fruits hang in bright
sheaves
Between the rounded and the negroid
leaves. . . .
And we remember nursery afternoons
When the small music-box of the sweet snow
Gave half-forgotten tunes, and our nurse
told
Us tales that fell with the same tinkling
notes. . . . -- 
"Once on a time," she said, "and long ago."
Her voice was sweet as the bright-sparkling
rime,
The fruits are cold as that sweet music's
time -- 
Yet all those fruits like the bright snow will
fade.
The country bumpkins travel to the Fair,
For Night and Day and Hell and Heaven
Seem. -- 
Only a clown's booth seen in some bad dream,
Wherefrom we watch the movements of our
life
Growing and ripening like summer fruits
And dwindling into dust, a mirage lie :

Hell is no vastness, it has naught to keep
But little rotting souls and a small sleep.
It has the same bright-coloured clarity we
knew
In nursery afternoons so long ago,
Bright as our childish dreams; but we are
old,
This is a different world; the snow lies cold
Upon our heart, though midsummer is
here. . . .

BUT in the Court, the little people know
That Sleep is bright as fruit, and soft as snow.
The sunlight seems like warm brocade
In the courtyard, through the great arcade;
And golden as a Sultan's turban
The ripened medlars hang; the urban
Maids of the ladies at the palace
Talked like birds, with a gentle malice,
And on the wall, light-motes take shapes
Of vines with showers of emerald grapes.
"Queen Venus is a toothless crone,
Blackened with age ; all night alone
She lies, and no bird ever cries
For the wild starlight of her eyes."
"Once Helen was Prince Paris' doxy;
She meets her lovers now by proxy,
And wrinkled as the gold sea-sand
Are the breasts that once seemed heaven's
land."


"Look at that little shadow . . . oh, the
joy,
As black as any jewelled negro boy.
O little shade -- see, I will call him Zambo.
Look where he silent sits and plays dumb-crambo
There at the door, with ghosts . . . and his
mentero,
Half in brocaded sunlight, points to Zero!
Black fingers stretched to pluck the fruits of
gold
Through the great leaves. . . . I feel a
sudden cold
Sweet air from the arcade. . . . Again it
goes.
The scented darkness seems as rich as snows,
Like cornucopias with ostrich plumes
And great gold fruits, the clouds seem from
these glooms."
Down in the great arcade of the courtyard
The fairies' coachmen, tawny as a pard,


Are talking of those feathered July eves
When all these dames desert their country
leaves
(Though still as lovely as those moonlight
maids
Juno and Dian, haunting their deep glades) -- 
And in their coach, with maids and footmen,
drive
Up to the great town houses where they live ;
No longer they seem fairies, but we see
Them named as the old Duchess of Bohea
And Madam Cards, the Marchioness of Gout;
Though they are old, they still enjoy a rout,
And through the dark leaves of the shadow-grove,
As wickedly as ever, eyes still rove
That dealt death from behind a fluttered fan
In Pompeii, Athens, before Time began.
In courtyards stained with the black night
like wine, -- 
Strange figures with hair lifted like a vine

Listen. . . . Who is it hearkens at their doors,
In the vast rooms and endless corridors
It is goat-footed, mincing Death, who presses
His muzzle at the keyhole, hears their dresses
Rustling like rose-leaves. . . . They hit him
with their fan,
Through scented moonlight move to their
sedan.
When the hot gilded day will reach
A restful close,
A Japanese dwarf forest on the beach,
With dark trees of the shadow, the street
grows.
How sand-like quivers the gold light
Under the large black leaves of shadow ;
mirage-bright
It lies, that dusty gold,
Untouched of any air,
Like Dead-Sea fruit carved in cornelian, bold
The faces of a man and Pleasure's mournful
daughter
Show lovely in the light, a moment flare,
Then shadows fall again -- dark agates through
clear water.

Then these Chinoiseries, old ghosts of red and
white
Smooth lacquer in their palanquins take
flight
For tea and the last esoteric rage
Whose plumes may soften age, that harpy's
cage.
Their smile is like Death's trap . . . a little
gilded dust
Of valueless beauty from the sun, soon must
Brush for a fading while each feathered cheek
That paradisal airs will never sleek, -- 
And round them, as they move, the unfading
sea Eternity
With its cool feathered airs of beauty, sighs,
of no horizons they can see.
What would these ghosts do, if the truths
they know,
That were served up like snow-cold jewelled
fruits
And the enfeathered airs of lutes,
Could be their guests in cold reality ?
They would be shivering,
Wide-eyed as a negro king

Seeing the evanescent mirage snow,
They would be silenced by the cold
That is of the spirit, endlessly
Unfabled and untold.
The swan's breath winter these have known
is finer
Fading than the early snows of China,
The poems of Queen Marguerite of Navarre,
(Narcissus-petalled, perfumed like a star)
Or the Pleiades' citron-scented poems, fading
like the snows,
Perfuming their long fingers till their eyelids
close.
The winters these have known have been too
kind,
With skies that seemed the bitter gilded rind
Of unattainable fruits; small women go
As white as ermines, and small winds are slow
As tunes upon a lute; the point-lace on the
treeS
And the pearl-berries of the snow upon dark
bushes freeze,

And the snow falls, as sharp and bright,
unripe and sour
As the budding grapes' bright perfume, or
the sweet grape-flower.
The daughters of the Silence now are dead,
And these Chinoiserie ghosts,
These mummies in dim hosts,
Tread the long mournful avenues instead,
Alarm the soul by their cold interest -- 
For what can be the purpose of their quest ?
When spring begins, in China and Thibet
Through belled lime-avenues a springe is set
To catch the softly-smiling wind,
The cherubim to catch and blind
As cruel men blind a singing-bird;
They trap them with the sound of lutes
And the softest smiles of fruits,
That these old ghosts may prove the
feathered creatures real to hold,
And make them sing upon a perch of gold
In cages with a foolish bell-hung gable
Amid the powders on their dressing-table.
Till, trapped by our mortality, they die, and
their small bones,
Sounding as sweetly as the west wind's tones,

Are sold because they sound like a small
music-box.
Their slayers sell for silver the bright
plumes in flocks,
To make the pillows for a sleepy head
That never dreams of heaven, but the lonely
Dead.
And still they dwindle the bright world down
to the gilded glooms
Of dust, these mummies, hieing, harrying fast
The Soul, their quarry, through the deserted
tombs -- 
Or lying, lotus-eaters in a dreamful ease,
Perfuming their cold lips with silence and the
past
Beneath the Asian darkness of smooth
trees. . . ."
Thus spoke the men; then sleep came colder
than the rose
Blooming in desolation. . . . No one knows
The end there is to dust -- it is the soul that
shall survive them at the last.


BENEAth a wan and sylvan tree
Whose water-flowing beauty our tired eyes
Can feel from very far, two travellers lie.
And one is swarthy as the summer wind,+
A man who travelled from a far countree ;
The other Soldan in his pomp and panoply
Seems like le Roi Soleil in all his pride
When his gold periwig is floating wide.
They talked together, those dark kings
beneath the bough,
And their songs mingled with soft winds that
flow.
THE SoLDAN (sings)
"When green as a river was the barley,
Green as a river the rye,
I waded deep and began to parley
With a youth whom I heard sigh.
"I seek," said he, `a lovely lady,
A nymph as bright as a queen,
Like a tree that drips with pearls her shady
Locks of hair were seen ;
And all the rivers became her flocks
Though their wool you cannot shear,
Because of the love of her flowing locks.

The kingly sun like a swain
Came strong, unheeding of her scorn,
Wading in deeps where she has lain,
Sleeping upon her river lawn
And chasing her starry satyr train.
She fled, and changed into a tree,_
That lovely fair-haired lady. . . .
And now I seek through the sere summer
Where no trees are shady!`
They say that Daphne never was more
fair
With all the shaken pearls of her long hair -- 
The lovely tree that was Apollo's love,
To whom he brought his richest spoils -- 
than she!
And oh, that other Soldan, the hot sun
Burns not with love as I, with my dark
pomp,
My helmet thick-plumed as a water-god's,
Whose cornucopia filled with dripping jewels
Is not so rich as treasuries I bear -- 
Dark spices, nard and spikenard, ambergris . . .

No maid will change into a tree before my
kiss


THE MAN FRoM A FAR Countree
"But I will be content with some far-lesser
maid,
Who feeds her flocks beneath afair-haired tree
And listens to the wind's song; she shall be
My soldanesse, and rule my far countree.
(Sings)
Rose and Alice,
Oh, the pretty lassies
With their mouths like a calice
And their hair a golden palace -- 
Through my heart like a lovely wind they
blow.
Though I am black and not comely,
Though I am black as the darkest trees,
I have swarms of gold that will fly like honey-bees,
By the rivers of the sun I will feed my words
Until they skip like those fleeced lambs
The waterfalls, and the rivers (horned rams),
Then for all my darkness I shall be
The peacefulness of a lovely tree -- 
A tree wherein the golden birds
Are singing in the darkest branches, oh!"

Thus sang these plumed kings, and the winds
that flow
Whispered of lands no waking heart may
know.


Now from the silk pavilions of the seas
The nymphs sing, gold and cold as orange-treeS :
"Through gilded trellises
Of the heat, Dolores,
Inez, Manuccia,
Isabel, Lucia,
Mock Time that flies.
`Lovely bird, will you stay and sing,
Flirting your sheened wing,
Peck with your beak, and cling
To our balconies?
They flirt their fans, flaunting -- 
"O silence enchanting
As music!" then slanting
Their eyes
Like gilded or emerald grapes
They take mantillas, capes,
Hiding their simian shapes.
Sighs
Each lady, "Our spadille
Is done.` . . . "Dance the quadrille
From Hell's towers to Seville,
Surprise

Their siesta, Dolores
Said. Through gilded trellises
Of the heat, spangles
Pelt down through the tangles
Of bell-flowers; each dangles
Her castanets, shutters
Fall while the heat mutters,
With sounds like a mandoline
Or tinkled tambourine. . . .
Ladies, Time dies! 
And petals of the foam, like perfumed orange-blossom,
Pelt the nymphs singing in their bowers -- 
cold as their bosom.

In the hot noon like glowing muscadine
The light seems, and the shade like golden
wine.
Beneath the deep shade of the trees' arcade,
All foppish in his dressing-gown's brocade
And turban, comes the great Magnifico,
And hearkens not where the becafico
Time taps at the lovely sylvan trees.
Now underneath. the shadows fallen from
these
The queen sits with her court, and through
the glade
The light from their silks casts another silver
shade.
Home goes the great Magnifico, his dressing-gown
Is changed for water-rustling silks that
drown
The shades, and walking proudly as the breeze
Now he advances through the sylph-slim
treeS.

"Madam, the Soldan and the King of
Ethiop's land
Approach as suitors for your daughter's
hand."
The day grew water-pale and cool as eves. . .
A lady sang through water-rippling leaves :
"The mauve summer rain
Is falling again -- 
It soaks through the eaves
And the ladies' sleeves -- 
It soaks through the leaves
That like silver fish fall
In the fountains, recall
Afternoons when I
Was a child small and shy
In the palace. . . . Fish lie
On the grass with lives darkling.
Our laughter falls sparkling
As the mauve raindrops bright
When they fall through the light
With the briefest delight.

The pavilions float
On the lake like a boat. . . .
Mauve rains from trees fall
Like wysteria flowers . . . all
My life is like this
And drifts into nothingness
The strange ladies sigh
"The autumn is nigh" . . .
The King bows and mutters. . . .
His eyelids seem shutters
Of a palace pavilion
Deserted a million
Echoing years ago.
Oh, but the rain falls slow."
But no one heard the great Magnifico
Or this pale song, for underneath the low
Deep bough the queen slept, while the flowers
that fall
Seemed Ariadne's starry coronal.

In the great room above the orangery
The old queen's dwarfs are drinking their
bohea
While the thin flames seem gold and whispering leaves
Of trees in the Hesperides, whose faint
sound grieves.
So small they could be hid in a pomander
Miss Ellen and Sir Pompey Alexander
Seem . . . the tea is gold as evening,
The perfumes in the orangery sing,
And, flashing like exotic-plumaged birds,
The lovely shadows whisper unknown words.
Upon the wall, the portrait of Queen Anne
Frowned at them, and waved a languid
fan, -- 
Queen Anne, whose white wig glittering in
the net
Of gold light seems a florid bergerette

Sheep-floury underneath the powder . . .
Her lips' small strawberry said "Louder"
To the shadows' fluttering bird . . .
But the lovely one scarce heard. . . .
The zephyrs' lips like ruffled roses sleek
Caressingly each faintly upturned cheek;
And now the shutters like blue water
Fall . . . where is the King's daughter
The candle-flames seem orange-flowers
Whose pale light falls in perfumed showers;
But Queen Anne, sleeping on the wall,
Long dead, would answer not at all.

THE little golden lights like Chinese ladies
peep
Through the old queen's curtains, then like
sleep
Their gentle footsteps fade again and fail,
And once again the world is ghostly pale.
In the queen's powder-closet, Mrs. Troy
Teases the flames to wake them and annoy . . .
So pale are those thin ghostly flames that yet
They seem like the old notes of a spinet
That sometimes sounds a courrante or
gavotte
By Mozart or Scarlatti -- sometimes not -- 
While the pale silken ribbons of the rain,
Knotted, are fluttering down the window-pane.
But suddenly the flames turn green and red
As unripe fruit; their shrilling fills her head


With noises like a painted puppet-show ;
And in that music, shrieking high and low,
Dead is the pointed flames' small minuet -- 
And from the shrilling fire leaps Laidronette.
The ghostly apparition that appeared
Wagged from her chin a cockatrice's beard :
She crouches like a flame, the adder-sting
Of her sharp tongue is ready ; hear her sing:
"The candle flames bob
Like strawberries low,
Bobcherry, bobcherry,
See them go
In the hands of the queen's maids
Under the trees
Of the shadow, flickering in the breeze.
Crept a starved and a humble air
From the hovels, grunting with low pig-snout, -- 
Starved thin, creeping
Everywhere, weeping
It blew the queen's strawberry candle-flames
Out.

The maids in long chequered gowns
Hunting for these
Find but the shadows'
Flickering trees."
The humble ghosts like poppet maids
Walk tiptoe in the shadow glades.
Their mouths seem small red strawberries;
Their na ve naiad titterings freeze
The airs in the long corridors
Where they must hark at hopeless doors.
And Mrs. Troy rose up like a thin shriek
Or pointed flame. . . . "Oh, my poor head
is weak!
Oh dear,
Oh dear,
Whatever shall I do
In the flames' shrill rout
Laidronette slipped through.
I forget the Latin
For my prayer

My quilted satin
Is beyond repair
I must tell the queen -- 
But I dare not be seen
Oh dear, oh dear,
I tremble with fear
Like a nectarine bough
When the sun shines through.
How harmless has been my poor life -- 
Yet when a young girl, I had strife
Out, alas ! how I remember
That dawn when to light the ember
I must steal and I must creep
In the kitchen half asleep.
Noises from the sharp green wood
Burnt and bit my satyr blood,
And my cockscomb hair raised ire
In parrot whistlers in the fire
Now the ember as it dozes
Seems lattices of bunch d roses,
Fuchsias and fat strawberries,
Dahlias, cherries, and one sees
Through those lattices' gold wire
The parrot whistlers in the fire,
Pecking cherries every one.

"Polly, put the kettle on,"
Scream they ; "scratch poor pretty Polly"
(Kettles hissing at their folly!).
From the wood they spring and scream,
Scald the milk, upset the cream, . . .
Oh the feathers jewel-bright !
Alas! my life was never light."
The shrill flames nodded, beckoned, then lay
dead;
Her wig awry, cross Poll Troy nods her head.
The long dark corridors seem shadow-groves
Wherein a little courtier air still roves. . . .
Pale rose-leaves, wet and scented, seems the
rain,
Whose bright drops cease, as soft as sleep
again.
Her gown seems like a pale and tuneful rose,
Hours passed; the soft melodious moonlight
grows. . . .

A murmurous sound of far-off Circean seas
And old enchantments and the growth of
treeS.
Across the silver grass the powdered ghosts
Are wandering in dim and scattered hosts
Among the woods and fields, and they forget
Everything but that their love's hand yet
Is touching theirs; the ribbons of the moon
are blue
And pink; those ghosts pick bunches from
the dew
Of ghostly flowers all poignant with spring
rain,
Smelling of youth that will not come again.

THE public Scribe, noctambulo,
Where moonlight cold as blades of grass
Echoes upon deserted walls
Turned his dusty folio. . . .
Dry grass that cackles thin in Hell
The spires of fire . . . his nightcap fell. .
Doctor Gradus
Mounts Parnassus
On that dusty ass the Law.
His hair is grey
As asses' ears,
The cold wind's bray
He never hears. .
O'er donkey's hide grass the attorney
Still continues on his journey
With the dusty Law's proceedings,
Through the old forrestial readings
For the Town of Troy
Prince Paris lost when yet a boy.

Il Dottore in the long grass
Culls the simples, cold henbane,
Nettles that make fevers pass,
Wood-spurge that will cure a blain.

He walks where weeds have covered all. . . .
The moon's vast echoes die
Across the plain where weeds grown tall
Pearled treasuries of Asia seem,
Sunk in an endless dream.
And the mandarins in Asia,
In the silken palace of the moon,
Are all who are left to drink this physic
That will restore them from a swoon.

NIGHT passed, and in that world of leaves
The Dawn came, rustling like corn-sheaves;
And a small wind came like little boy blue
Over the cornfield and rustling through
The large leaves. . . . Oh, how very deep
The old queen is sighing in her sleep :
"Alas, blue wind,
Bluebeard unkind,
Why have you blown so far from me
Through the jewelled blue leaves that sound
like the sea,
The lady Margotte,
The goosegirl Gargotte
Agog with curiosity ?
They played Troy Town on the palace
wall
Like small grape hyacinths were their curls
And thin as the spring wind were those girls -- 
But now they never come if I call."
The kingly cock with his red-gold beard
And his red-gold crown had crowed unheard

While his queens ruffled down
Their feathered gown
Beside the waterfall's crystal town.
The cock, the dawn-fruits, the gold corn
Sing this aubade, cold, forlorn :
"Jane, Jane,
Forget the pain
In your heart. Go work again.
Light is given that you may
Work till owl-soft dusk of day.
The morning light whines on the floor, . . .
No one e'er will cross the door,
No one ever cares to know
How ragged flowers like you do grow.
Like beaux and belles about the Court
King James the Second held, athwart
The field the sheep run, -foolish graces,
Periwigs, long Stuart faces,

While ragged robins' cockscomb flowers
Cluck beneath the crystal showers.
A far-off huntsman sounds his horn
That sounds like rain, harsh and forlorn ;
Pink as his coat, poor robin seems. . . .
Jane, no longer lie in dreams.
The crude pink stalactites of rain
Are sounding from the boughs again,
Each sighs the name of Harriet, Mary,
Susan, Anne, grown cold and wary -- 
Never yours. Once, bright and gay,
They used to whisper `Come away,`
But now they have forgotten why.
Come, no longer sleeping lie.
Jane, Jane,
Forget the pain
In your heart. Go work again "

No answer came. No footsteps now will
climb
Down from Jane's attic. She forgets the
time,
Her wages, plainness, and how none could
love
A maid with cockscomb hair, in Sleep's dark
grove.

AND now the brutish forests close around
The beauty sleeping in enchanted ground.
All night, the harsh bucolic winds that
grunt -- 
Through those green curtains, help me in my
hunt.
Oh the swinish hairy beasts
Of the rough wind
(Wild boars tearing through the forests) :
Nothing they will find
But stars like empty wooden nuts
In leaves green and shrill.
Home they go to their rough stye
The clouds . . . and home go I.
Above the wooden shutters
Of my room at morn,
Like bunches of the country flowers
Seem the fresh dawn hours.
And the young dawn creeps
Tiptoe through my room, . . .
Never speaks of one who sleeps
In the forest's gloom.


THE gardener played his old bagpipe
To make the melons and the peaches ripe. ...
The threads are mixed in a tartan sound . . .
"Keep, my lad, to the good safe ground.
For Jonah long since was a felon
With guineas gold as a grape or melon.
He always said his prayers in Latin
To peaches like red quilted satin;
And he had four and twenty daughters
As lovely as the thick-fleeced waters
Or the Hesperides' thick-leaved trees -- 
And they were lovely as the evening breeze.
One Sabbath roamed that godless man
Beneath the great trees sylvan wan,
And met an ancient satyr crone
Cold as the droning wind the drone
Hears when the thickest gold will thrive
Summer-long in the combs of the honey-hive.
She said, `You must cease to leeze and
pheeze
Your sheep as thick and as white as cheese.
It is time you sailed, as I understand,
To better yourself in a Better Land."

The sea was sharper than green grass,
The sailors would not let him pass,
For the sea was wroth and rose at him
Like the turreted walls of Jerusalem
Or like the towers and gables seen
In the midst of a deep-boughed garden green.
If my old bagpipe I blew
It would not blow those great towers down.
The sailors took and bound him, threw
Him in among those towers to drown.
And oh, far best," the gardener said,
"Like fruits to lie in your kind bed,
To sleep as snug as in the grave
In your kind bed, and shun the wave,
Nor ever sigh for a strange land
And songs no heart can understand."


Personae


Grace before Song


     Lord God of heaven that with mercy dight
     Th' alternate prayer-wheel of the night and light
     Eternal hath to thee, and in whose sight
     Our days as rain drops in the sea surge fall,

     As bright white drops upon a leaden sea
     Grant so my songs to this grey folk may be:

     As drops that dream and gleam and falling catch the sun,
     Evan'scent mirrors every opal one
     Of such his splendour as their compass is,
     So, bold My Songs, seek ye such death as this.



                 SCENE: _The Ash Wood of Malvern._


     For I was a gaunt, grave councillor
     Being in all things wise, and very old,
     But I have put aside this folly and the cold
     That old age weareth for a cloak.

     I was quite strong -- at least they said so -- 
     The young men at the sword-play;
     But I have put aside this folly, being gay
     In another fashion that more suiteth me.

     I have curled mid the boles of the ash wood,
     I have hidden my face where the oak
     Spread his leaves over me, and the yoke
     Of the old ways of men have I cast aside.

     By the still pool of Mar-nan-otha
     Have I found me a bride
     That was a dog-wood tree some syne.
     She hath called me from mine old ways
     She hath hushed my rancour of council,
     Bidding me praise

     Naught but the wind that flutters in the leaves.

     She hath drawn me from mine old ways,
     Till men say that I am mad;
     But I have seen the sorrow of men, and am glad,
     For I know that the wailing and bitterness are a folly.
     And I? I have put aside all folly and all grief.
     I wrapped my tears in an ellum leaf
     And left them under a stone
     And now men call me mad because I have thrown
     All folly from me, putting it aside
     To leave the old barren ways of men,
     Because my bride
     Is a pool of the wood, and
     Though all men say that I am mad
     It is only that I am glad,
     Very glad, for my bride hath toward me a great love
     That is sweeter than the love of women
     That plague and burn and drive one away.

     Aie-e! 'Tis true that I am gay
         Quite gay, for I have her alone here
         And no man troubleth us.

     Once when I was among the young men....
     And they said I was quite strong, among the young men.
     Once there was a woman....
     .... but I forget.... she was....
     .... I hope she will not come again.

     .... I do not remember....
     I think she hurt me once, but....
     That was very long ago.

     I do not like to remember things any more.

     I like one little band of winds that blow
     In the ash trees here:
     For we are quite alone
     Here mid the ash trees.




Cino



     Bah! I have sung women in three cities,
     But it is all the same;
     And I will sing of the sun.

     Lips, words, and you snare them,
     Dreams, words, and they are as jewels,
     Strange spells of old deity,
     Ravens, nights, allurement:
     And they are not;
     Having become the souls of song.

     Eyes, dreams, lips, and the night goes.
     Being upon the road once more,
     They are not.
     Forgetful in their towers of our tuneing
     Once for Wind-runeing
     They dream us-toward and
     Sighing, say, Would Cino,
     Passionate Cino, of the wrinkling eyes,
     Gay Cino, of quick laughter,
     Cino, of the dare, the jibe,
     Frail Cino, strongest of his tribe
     That tramp old ways beneath the sun-light,
     Would Cino of the Luth were here!

     Once, twice, a year -- 
     Vaguely thus word they:

         Cino? Oh, eh, Cino Polnesi
         The singer is't you mean?
         Ah yes, passed once our way,
         A saucy fellow, but....
         (Oh they are all one these vagabonds),
         Peste! 'tis his own songs?
         Or some other's that he sings?
         But _you_, My Lord, how with your city?

     But you My Lord, God's pity!
     And all I knew were out, My Lord, you
     Were Lack-land Cino, e'en as I am,
     O Sinistro.

     I have sung women in three cities.
     But it is all one.
     I will sing of the sun.

     .... eh?.... they mostly had grey eyes,
     But it is all one, I will sing of the sun.

         'Pollo Phoibee, old tin pan, you
         Glory to Zeus' aegis-day,
         Shield o' steel-blue, th' heaven o'er us
         Hath for boss thy lustre gay!

         'Pollo Phoibee, to our way-fare
         Make thy laugh our wander-lied;
         Bid thy 'fulgence bear away care.
         Cloud and rain-tears pass they fleet!

         Seeking e'er the new-laid rast-way
         To the gardens of the sun....
                  *  *  *  *  *
                  *  *  *  *  *
         I have sung women in three cities
         But it is all one.

         I will sing of the white birds
         In the blue waters of heaven,
         The clouds that are spray to its sea.




Na Audiart


     Though thou well dost wish me ill
                                 Audiart, Audiart,
     Where thy bodice laces start
     As ivy fingers clutching through
     Its crevices,
                    Audiart, Audiart,
     Stately, tall and lovely tender
     Who shall render
                          Audiart, Audiart
     Praises meet unto thy fashion?
     Here a word kiss!
                        Pass I on
     Unto Lady Miels-de-Ben,
     Having praised thy girdle's scope
     How the stays ply back from it;
     I breathe no hope
     That thou shouldst....
                               Nay no whit
     Bespeak thyself for anything.
     Just a word in thy praise, girl,
     Just for the swirl
     Thy satins make upon the stair,
     'Cause never a flaw was there
     Where thy torse and limbs are met:
     Though thou hate me, read it set
     In rose and gold.
     Or when the minstrel, tale half told,
     Shall burst to lilting at the phrase
                                 Audiart, Audiart....
     Bertrans, master of his lays,
     Bertrans of Aultaforte thy praise
     Sets forth, and though thou hate me well,
     Yea though thou wish me ill
                             Audiart, Audiart.
     Thy loveliness is here writ till,
                                       Audiart,
     Oh, till thou come again.
     And being bent and wrinkled, in a form
     That hath no perfect limning, when the warm
     Youth dew is cold
     Upon thy hands, and thy old soul
     Scorning a new, wry'd casement
     Churlish at seemed misplacement
     Finds the earth as bitter
     As now seems it sweet,
     Being so young and fair
     As then only in dreams,
     Being then young and wry'd,
     Broken of ancient pride,
     Thou shalt then soften,
     Knowing I know not how
     Thou wert once she
                         Audiart, Audiart
     For whose fairness one forgave
                                    Audiart, Audiart




Villonaud for this Yule


     Towards the Noel that morte saison
     (_Christ make the shepherds' homage dear!_)
     Then when the grey wolves everychone
     Drink of the winds their chill small-beer
     And lap o' the snows food's gueredon
     Then makyth my heart his yule-tide cheer
     (Skoal! with the dregs if the clear be gone!)
     Wineing the ghosts of yester-year.

     Ask ye what ghosts I dream upon?
     (_What of the magians' scented gear?_)
     The ghosts of dead loves everyone
     That make the stark winds reek with fear
     Lest love return with the foison sun
     And slay the memories that me cheer
     (Such as I drink to mine fashion)
     Wineing the ghosts of yester-year.

     Where are the joys my heart had won?
     (_Saturn and Mars to Zeus drawn near!_)
     Where are the lips mine lay upon,
     Aye! where are the glances feat and clear
     That bade my heart his valour don?
     I skoal to the eyes as grey-blown mere
     (Who knows whose was that paragon?)
     Wineing the ghosts of yester-year.

     Prince: ask me not what I have done
     Nor what God hath that can me cheer
     But ye ask first where the winds are gone
     Wineing the ghosts of yester-year.





A Villonaud

Ballad of the Gibbet

Or the song of the sixth companion


         Drink ye a skoal for the gallows tree!
     Francois and Margot and thee and me,
     Drink we the comrades merrily
     That said us, Till then for the gallows tree!

         Fat Pierre with the hook gauche-main,
     Thomas Larron Ear-the-less,
     Tybalde and that armouress
     Who gave this poignard its premier stain
     Pinning the Guise that had been fain
     To make him a mate of the Haulte Noblesse
     And bade her be out with ill address
     As a fool that mocketh his drue's disdeign.

         Drink we a skoal for the gallows tree!
     Francois and Margot and thee and me,
     Drink we to Marienne Ydole,
     That hell brenn not her o'er cruelly.

         Drink we the lusty robbers twain,
     Black is the pitch o' their wedding-dress,
     Lips shrunk back for the wind's caress
     As lips shrink back when we feel the strain
     Of love that loveth in hell's disdeign
     And sense the teeth through the lips that press
     'Gainst our lips for the soul's distress
     That striveth to ours across the pain.
     Drink we skoal to the gallows tree!
     Francois and Margot and thee and me,
     For Jehan and Raoul de Vallerie
     Whose frames have the night and its winds in fee.

         Maturin, Guillaume, Jacques d'Allmain,
     Culdou lacking a coat to bless
     One lean moiety of his nakedness
     That plundered St. Hubert back o' the fane:
     Aie! the lean bare tree is widowed again
     For Michault le Borgne that would confess
     In faith and troth to a traitoress,
     Which of his brothers had he slain?

         But drink we skoal to the gallows tree!
     Francois and Margot and thee and me:

     These that we loved shall God love less
     And smite alway at their faibleness?

     Skoal!! to the Gallows! and then pray we:
     God damn his hell out speedily
     And bring their souls to his Haulte Citee.





Mesmerism


     Aye you're a man that! ye old mesmerizer
     Tyin' your meanin' in seventy swadelin's,
     One must of needs be a hang'd early riser
     To catch you at worm turning. Holy Odd's bodykins!

     Cat's i' the water butt! Thought's in your verse-barrel,
     Tell us this thing rather, then we'll believe you,
     You, Master Bob Browning, spite your apparel
     Jump to your sense and give praise as we'd lief do.

     You wheeze as a head-cold long-tonsilled Calliope,
     But God! what a sight you ha' got o' our in'ards,
     Mad as a hatter but surely no Myope,
     Broad as all ocean and leanin' man-kin'ards.

     Heart that was big as the bowels of Vesuvius,
     Words that were wing'd as her sparks in eruption,
     Eagled and thundered as Jupiter Pluvius,
     Sound in your wind past all signs o' corruption.

     Here's to you, Old Hippety-hop o' the accents,
     True to the Truth's sake and crafty dissector,
     You grabbed at the gold sure; had no need to pack cents
     Into your versicles.
                          Clear sight's elector!

     Sharing his exile that hath borne the flame,
     Joining his freedom that hath drunk the shame
     And known the torture of the Skull-place hours
     Free and so bound, that mingled with the powers
     Of air and sea and light his soul's far reach
     Yet strictured did the body-lips beseech
     To drink I thirst. And then the sponge of gall.

     Wherefore we wastrels that the grey road's call
     Doth master and make slaves and yet make free,
     Drink all of life and quaffing lustily
     Take bitter with the sweet without complain
     And sharers in his drink defy the pain
     That makes you fearful to unfurl your souls.

     We claim no glory. If the tempest rolls
     About us we have fear, and then
     Having so small a stake grow bold again.
     We know not definitely even this
     But 'cause some vague half knowing half doth miss
     Our consciousness and leaves us feeling
     That somehow all is well, that sober, reeling
     From the last carouse, or in what measure
     Of so called right or so damned wrong our leisure
     Runs out uncounted sand beneath the sun,
     That, spite your carping, still the thing is done
     With some deep sanction, that, we know not how,
     Sans thought gives us this feeling; you allow
     That this not need we _know_ our every thought
     Or see the work shop where each mask is wrought
     Wherefrom we view the world of box and pit,
     Careless of wear, just so the mask shall fit
     And serve our jape's turn for a night or two.

     Call! eh bye! the little door at twelve!

     I meet you there myself.




In Tempore Senectutis


         For we are old
     And the earth passion dieth;
     We have watched him die a thousand times,
     When he wanes an old wind crieth,
         For we are old
     And passion hath died for us a thousand times
         But we grew never weary.

     Memory faileth, as the lotus-loved chimes
         Sink into fluttering of wind,
         But we grow never weary
         For we are old.

     The strange night-wonder of your eyes
     Dies not, though passion flieth
         Along the star fields of Arcturus
     And is no more unto our hands;
         My lips are cold
     And yet we twain are never weary,
     And the strange night-wonder is upon us,
     The leaves hold our wonder in their flutterings,
     The wind fills our mouths with strange words
         For our wonder that grows not old.

     The moth-hour of our day is upon us
         Holding the dawn;
     There is strange Night-wonder in our eyes
     Because the Moth-Hour leadeth the dawn
     As a maiden, holding her fingers,
     The rosy, slender fingers of the dawn.

     He saith: Red spears bore the warrior dawn
                             Of old
         Strange! Love, hast thou forgotten
               The red spears of the dawn,
               The pennants of the morning?

     She saith: Nay, I remember, but now
         Cometh the Dawn, and the Moth-Hour
           Together with him; softly
             For we are old.

     Your songs?
                 Oh! The little mothers
     Will sing them in the twilight,
     And when the night
     Shrinketh the kiss of the dawn
     That loves and kills,
     What time the swallow fills
     Her note, the little rabbit folk
     That some call children,
     Such as are up and wide
     Will laugh your verses to each other,
     Pulling on their shoes for the day's business,
     Serious child business that the world
     Laughs at, and grows stale;
     Such is the tale
     -- Part of it -- of thy song-life

     Mine?

         A book is known by them that read
         That same. Thy public in my screed
         Is listed. Well! Some score years hence
         Behold mine audience,
         As we had seen him yesterday.

         Scrawny, be-spectacled, out at heels,
     Such an one as the world feels
     A sort of curse against its guzzling
     And its age-lasting wallow for red greed
     And yet; full speed
     Though it should run for its own getting,
     Will turn aside to sneer at
     'Cause he hath
     No coin, no will to snatch the aftermath
     Of Mammon.

     Such an one as women draw away from
     For the tobacco ashes scattered on his coat
     And sith his throat
     Show razor's unfamiliarity
     And three days' beard:

     Such an one picking a ragged
     Backless copy from the stall,
     Too cheap for cataloguing,
     Loquitur,

         Ah-eh! the strange rare name....
     Ah-eh! He must be rare if even _I_ have not....
     And lost mid-page
     Such age
     As his pardons the habit,
     He analyzes form and thought to see
     How I 'scaped immortality.

         When I see thee as some poor song-bird
         Battering its wings, against this cage we
         Today,
     Then would I speak comfort unto thee,
     From out the heights I dwell in, when
     That great sense of power is upon me
     And I see my greater soul-self bending
     Sibylwise with that great forty year epic
     That you know of, yet unwrit
     But as some child's toy 'tween my fingers,
     And see the sculptors of new ages carve me thus,
     And model with the music of my couplets in their hearts:

     Surely if in the end the epic
     And the small kind deed are one;
     If to God the child's toy and the epic are the same,
     E'en so, did one make a child's toy,
     He might wright it well
     And cunningly, that the child might
     Keep it for his children's children
     And all have joy thereof.

     Dear, an this dream come true,
     Then shall all men say of thee
     She 'twas that played him power at life's morn,
     And at the twilight Evensong,
     And God's peace dwelt in the mingled chords
     She drew from out the shadows of the past,
     And old world melodies that else
     He had known only in his dreams
     Of Iseult and of Beatrice.

     Dear, an this dream come true,
     I, who being poet only,
     Can give thee poor words only,
     Add this one poor other tribute,
     This thing men call immortality.
     A gift I give thee even as Ronsard gave it.
     Seeing before time, one sweet face grown old,
     And seeing the old eyes grow bright
     From out the border of Her fire-lit wrinkles,
     As she should make boast unto her maids
     Ronsard hath sung the beauty, _my_ beauty,
               Of the days that I was fair.

     So hath the boon been given, by the poets of old time
     (Dante to Beatrice, -- an I profane not -- )
     Yet with my lesser power shall I not strive
                     To give it thee?

     All ends of things are with Him
     From whom are all things in their essence.
     If my power be lesser
     Shall my striving be less keen?
     But rather more! if I would reach the goal,
                   Take then the striving!
     And if, for so the Florentine hath writ
     When having put all his heart
     Into his Youth's Dear Book
     He yet strove to do more honour
     To that lady dwelling in his inmost soul
     He would wax yet greater
     To make her earthly glory more.
     Though sight of hell and heaven were price thereof,
     If so it be His will, with whom
     Are all things and through whom
     Are all things good,
     Will I make for thee and for the beauty of thy music
     A new thing
     As hath not heretofore been writ.
                  Take then my promise!




Praise of Ysolt


     In vain have I striven
     to teach my heart to bow;
     In vain have I said to him
     There be many singers greater than thou.

     But his answer cometh, as winds and as lutany.
     As a vague crying upon the night
     That leaveth me no rest, saying ever,
                         Song, a song.

     Their echoes play upon each other in the twilight
     Seeking ever a song.
     Lo, I am worn with travail
     And the wandering of many roads hath made my eyes
     As dark red circles filled with dust.
     Yet there is a trembling upon me in the twilight,
           And little red elf words crying A song,
           Little grey elf words crying for a song,
           Little brown leaf words crying A song,
           Little green leaf words crying for a song.

     The words are as leaves, old brown leaves in the
           spring time
     Blowing they know not whither, seeking a song.

     White words as snow flakes but they are cold
     Moss words, lip words, words of slow streams.

     In vain have I striven
           to teach my soul to bow,
     In vain have I pled with him,
         There be greater souls than thou.

     For in the morn of my years there came a woman
     As moon light calling
     As the moon calleth the tides,
                          Song, a song.
     Wherefore I made her a song and she went from me
     As the moon doth from the sea,
     But still came the leaf words, little brown elf words
     Saying The soul sendeth us.
                          A song, a song!
     And in vain I cried unto them I have no song
     For she I sang of hath gone from me.

     But my soul sent a woman, a woman of the wonder folk,
     A woman as fire upon the pine woods
          crying Song, a song.
     As the flame crieth unto the sap.
     My song was ablaze with her and she went from me
     As flame leaveth the embers so went she unto new
          forests
     And the words were with me
          crying ever Song, a song.

     And I I have no song,
     Till my soul sent a woman as the sun:
     Yea as the sun calleth to the seed,
     As the spring upon the bough
     So is she that cometh the song-drawer
     She that holdeth the wonder words within her eyes
     The words little elf words
          that call ever unto me
                            Song, a song.


     ENVOI

     In vain have I striven with my soul
           to teach my soul to bow.
     What soul boweth

Camaraderie



     Sometimes I feel thy cheek against my face
     Close-pressing, soft as is the South's first breath
     That all the subtle earth-things summoneth
     To spring in wood-land and in meadow space.

     Yea sometimes in a bustling man-filled place
     Me seemeth some-wise thy hair wandereth
     Across mine eyes, as mist that halloweth
     The air awhile and giveth all things grace.

     Or on still evenings when the rain falls close
     There comes a tremor in the drops, and fast
     My pulses run, knowing thy thought hath passed
     That beareth thee as doth the wind a rose.




Masks


     These tales of old disguisings, are they not
     Strange myths of souls that found themselves among
     Unwonted folk that spake a hostile tongue,
     Some soul from all the rest who'd not forgot
     The star-span acres of a former lot
     Where boundless mid the clouds his course he swung,
     Or carnate with his elder brothers sung
     E'er ballad makers lisped of Camelot?

     Old singers half-forgetful of their tunes,
     Old painters colour-blind come back once more,
     Old poets skilless in the wind-heart runes,
     Old wizards lacking in their wonder-lore:

     All they that with strange sadness in their eyes
     Ponder in silence o'er earth's queynt devyse?




Tally-O


     What ho! the wind is up and eloquent.
     Through all the Winter's halls he crieth Spring.
     Now will I get me up unto mine own forests
     And behold their bourgeoning.




Ballad for Gloom


     For God, our God, is a gallant foe
     That playeth behind the veil.

     I have loved my God as a child at heart
     That seeketh deep bosoms for rest,
     I have loved my God as maid to man
     But lo, this thing is best:

     To love your God as a gallant foe
                       that plays behind the veil,
     To meet your God as the night winds meet
                       beyond Arcturus' pale.

     I have played with God for a woman,
     I have staked with my God for truth,
     I have lost to my God as a man, clear eyed,
           His dice be not of ruth.

     For I am made as a naked blade
         But hear ye this thing in sooth:

     Who loseth to God as man to man
           Shall win at the turn of the game.
     I have drawn my blade where the lightnings meet
           But the ending is the same:
     Who loseth to God as the sword blades lose
           Shall win at the end of the game.

     For God, our God, is a gallant foe
                       that playeth behind the veil,
     Whom God deigns not to overthrow
                       Hath need of triple mail.




     Gone while your tastes were keen to you,
     Gone where the grey winds call to you,
     By that high fencer, even Death,
     Struck of the blade that no man parrieth;
     Such is your fence, one saith,
           One that hath known you.
     Drew you your sword most gallantly
     Made you your pass most valiantly
           'Gainst that grey fencer, even Death.

     Gone as a gust of breath
     Faith! no man tarrieth,
but it failed thee not!
it is the sword that speaks
     _In me_.
     Thou trusted'st in thyself and met the blade
     'Thout mask or gauntlet, and art laid
     As memorable broken blades that be
     Kept as bold trophies of old pageantry.
     As old Toledos past their days of war
     Are kept mnemonic of the strokes they bore,
     So art thou with us, being good to keep
     In our heart's sword-rack, though thy sword-arm sleep.


     ENVOI

     Struck of the blade that no man parrieth
     Pierced of the point that toucheth lastly all,
     'Gainst that grey fencer, even Death,
     Behold the shield! He shall not take thee all.






At the Heart o' Me

     With ever one fear at the heart o' me
     Long by still sea-coasts
             coursed my Grey-Falcon,
     And the twin delights
             of shore and sea were mine,
     Sapphire and emerald with
             fine pearls between.

     Through the pale courses of
             the land-caressing in-streams
     Glided my barge and
             the kindly strange peoples
     Gave to me laugh for laugh,
           and wine for my tales of wandering.
     And the cities gave me welcome
           and the fields free passage,
     With ever one fear
           at the heart o' me.

     An thou should'st grow weary
           ere my returning,
     An _they_ should call to thee
           from out the borderland,
     What should avail me
           booty of whale-ways?
     What should avail me
           gold rings or the chain-mail?
     What should avail me
           the many-twined bracelets?
     What should avail me,
           O my beloved,
     Here in this Middan-gard
           what should avail me
     Out of the booty and
           gain of my goings?




XENIA


     And
     Unto thine eyes my heart
     Sendeth old dreams of the spring-time,
     Yea of wood-ways my rime
     Found thee and flowers in and of all streams
     That sang low burthen, and of roses,
     That lost their dew-bowed petals for the dreams
     We scattered o'er them passing by.




Occidit


     Autumnal breaks the flame upon the sun-set herds.
     The sheep on Gilead as tawn hair gleam
     Neath Mithra's dower and his slow departing,
     While in the sky a thousand fleece of gold
     Bear, each his tribute, to the waning god.

     Hung on the rafters of the effulgent west,
     Their tufted splendour shields his decadence,
     As in our southern lands brave tapestries
     Are hung king-greeting from the ponticells
     And drag the pageant from the earth to air,
     Wherein the storied figures live again,
     Wind-molden back unto their life's erst guise,
     All tremulous beneath the many-fingered breath
     That Aufidus doth take to house his soul.



Search


I have heard a wee wind searching
Through still forests for me;
I have seen a wee wind searching
                    O'er still sea.

Through woodlands dim have I taken my way;
And o'er silent waters night and day
Have I sought the wee wind.




An Idyl for Glaucus

     Whither he went I may not follow him. His eyes
     Were strange to-day. They always were,
     After their fashion, kindred of the sea.

     To-day I found him. It is very long
     That I had sought among the nets, and when I asked
     The fishermen, they laughed at me.
     I sought long days amid the cliffs thinking to find
     The body-house of him, and then
     There at the blue cave-mouth my joy
     Grew pain for suddenness, to see him 'live.
     Whither he went I may not come, it seems
     He is become estranged from all the rest,
     And all the sea is now his wonder-house.
     And he may sink unto strange depths, he tells me of,
     That have no light as we it deem.
     E'en now he speaks strange words. I did not know
     One half the substance of his speech with me.
     And then when I saw naught he sudden leaped
     And shot, a gleam of silver, down, away.
     And I have spent three days upon this rock
     And yet he comes no more.
     He did not even seem to know
     I watched him gliding through the vitreous deep.


     They chide me that the skein I used to spin
     Holds not my interest now,
     They mock me at the route, well, I have come again.
     Last night I saw three white forms move
     Out past the utmost wave that bears the white foam crest.
     I somehow knew that he was one of them.

     Oime, Oime. I think each time they come
     Up from the sea heart to the realm of air
     They are more far-removed from the shore.
     When first I found him here, he slept
     E'en as he might after a long night's taking on the deep.
     And when he woke some whit the old kind smile
     Dwelt round his lips and held him near to me.
     But then strange gleams shot through the grey-deep eyes
     As though he saw beyond and saw not me.
     And when he moved to speak it troubled him.
     And then he plucked at grass and bade me eat.
     And then forgot me for the sea its charm
     And leapt him in the wave and so was gone.


     I wonder why he mocked me with the grass.
     I know not any more how long it is
     Since I have dwelt not in my mother's house.
     I know they think me mad, for all night long
     I haunt the sea-marge, thinking I may find
     Some day the herb he offered unto me.
     Perhaps he did not jest; they say some simples have
     More wide-spanned power than old wives draw from them.

     Perhaps, found I this grass, he'd come again.
     Perhaps 'tis some strange charm to draw him here,
     'Thout which he may not leave his new-found crew
     That ride the two-foot coursers of the deep,
     And laugh in storms and break the fishers' nets.
     Oime, Oime!


                 SONG.

        _Voices in the Wind._

     We have worn the blue and vair,
     And all the sea-caves
     Know us of old, and know our new-found mate.
     There's many a secret stair
     The sea-folk climb....

         _Out of the Wind._

          Oime, Oime!

     I wonder why the wind, even the wind doth seem
     To mock me now, all night, all night, and
     Have I strayed among the cliffs here
     They say, some day I'll fall
     Down through the sea-bit fissures, and no more
     Know the warm cloak of sun, or bathe
     The dew across my tired eyes to comfort them.
     They try to keep me hid within four walls.
     I will not stay!
                      Oime!
     And the wind saith; Oime!

     I am quite tired now. I know the grass
     Must grow somewhere along this Thracian coast,
     If only he would come some little while and find it me.

           ENDETH THE LAMENT FOR GLAUCUS




In Durance


     I am homesick after mine own kind,
     Oh I know that there are folk about me, friendly faces,
     But I am homesick after mine own kind.

     These sell our pictures! Oh well,
     They reach me not, touch me some edge or that,
     But reach me not and all my life's become
     One flame, that reacheth not beyond
     Mine heart's own hearth,
     Or hides among the ashes there for thee.
     Thee? Oh thee is who cometh first
     Out of mine own-soul-kin,
     For I am homesick after mine own kind
     And ordinary people touch me not.
                                   Yea, I am homesick
     After mine own kind that know, and feel
     And have some breath for beauty and the arts.

     Aye, I am wistful for my kin of the spirit
     And have none about me save in the shadows
     When come _they_, surging of power, DAEMON,
S.T. says, Beauty is most that a
           calling to the soul.
     Well then, so call they; the swirlers out of the mist
           of my soul,
     They that come mewards bearing old magic.

     But for all that, I am home sick after mine own kind
     And would meet kindred e'en as I am,
     Flesh-shrouded bearing the secret.
     All they that with strange sadness
     Have the earth in mock'ry, and are kind to all,
     My fellows, aye I know the glory
     Of th' unbounded ones, but ye, that hide
     As I hide most the while
     And burst forth to the windows only whiles or whiles
     For love, or hope, or beauty or for power,
     Then smoulder, with the lids half closed
     And are untouched by echoes of the world.

     Oh ye, my fellows: with the seas between us some be,
     Purple and sapphire for the silver shafts
     Of sun and spray all shattered at the bows
     Of such a Veltro of the vasty deep
     As bore my tortoise house scant years agone:
     And some the hills hold off,
     The little hills to east us, though here we
     Have damp and plain to be our shutting in.

     And yet my soul sings Up! and we are one.
     Yea thou, and Thou, and THOU, and all my kin
     To whom my breast and arms are ever warm,
     For that I love ye as the wind the trees
     That holds their blossoms and their leaves in cure
     And calls the utmost singing from the boughs
     That 'thout him, save the aspen, were as dumb
     Still shade, and bade no whisper speak the birds of how
     Beyond, beyond, beyond, there lies....




Guillaume de Lorris Belated

A Vision of Italy


     Wisdom set apart from all desire,
     A hoary Nestor with youth's own glad eyes,
     Him met I at the style, and all benign
     He greeted me an equal and I knew,
     By this his lack of pomp, he was himself.

     Slow-Smiling is companion unto him,
     And Mellow-Laughter serves, his trencherman.
     And I a thousand beauties there beheld.
     And he and they made merry endlessly.
     And love was rayed between them as a mist,
     And yet so fine and delicate a haze
     It did impede the eyes no whit,
     Unless it were to make the halo round each one
     Appear more myriad-jewelled marvellous,
     Than any pearled and ruby diadem the courts o' earth
           ha' known.
     Slender as mist-wrought maids and hamadryads
     Did meseem these shapes that ministered,
     These formed harmonies with lake-deep eyes,
     And first the cities of north Italy
     I did behold,
     Each as a woman wonder-fair,
     And svelte Verona first I met at eve;
     And in the dark we kissed and then the way
     Bore us somewhile apart.
     And yet my heart keeps tryst with her,
     So every year our thoughts are interwove
     As fingers were, such times as eyes see much, and tell.
     And she that loved the master years agone,
     That bears his signet in her Signor Square,

                           She spread her arms,
     And in that deep embrace
     All thoughts of woe were perished
     And of pain and weariness and all the wrack
     Of light-contending thoughts and battled-gleams,
     (That our intelligence doth gain by strife against itself)
     Of things we have not yet the earned right to clearly see.
     And all, yea all that dust doth symbolize
     Was there forgot, and my enfranchised soul
     Grew as the liquid elements, and was infused
     With joy that is not light, nor might nor harmony,
     And yet hath part and quality of all these three,
     Whereto is added calm past earthly peace.

     Thus with Verona's spirit, and all time
     Swept on beyond my ken, and as the sea
     Hath in no wise a form within itself,
     _Cioe_, as liquid hath no form save where it bounden is
     By some enshrouding chalice of hard things -- 
     As wine its graven goblet, and the sea
     Its wave-hewn basalt for a bordering,
     So had my thought and now my thought's remembrance
     No _in_formation of whatso there passed
     For this long space the dream-king's horny gate.

     And when that age was done and the transfusion
     Of all my self through her and she through me,
     I did perceive that she enthroned two things:
     Verona, and a maid I knew on earth;
     And dulled some while from dream, and then become
     That lower thing, deductive intellect, I saw
     How all things are but symbols of all things,
     And each of many, do we know
     But the equation governing.
     And in my rapture at this vision's scope
     I saw no end or bourn to what things mean,
     So praised Pythagoras and once more raised
     By this said rapture to the house of Dream,
     Beheld Fenice as a lotus-flower
     Drift through the purple of the wedded sea
     And grow a wraith and then a dark-eyed she,
     And knew her name was All-forgetfulness,
     And hailed her: Princess of the Opiates,
     And guessed her evil and her good thereby.

     And then a maid of nine Pavia hight,
     Passed with a laugh that was all mystery,
     And when I turned to her
     She reached me one clear chalice of white wine,
     Pressed from the recent grapes that yet were hung
     Adown her shoulders, and were bound
     Right cunningly about her elfish brows;
     So hale a draught, the life of every grape
     Lurked without ferment in the amber cloud.
     And memory, this wine was, of all good.

     And more I might have seen: Firenza, Goito,
     Or that proudest gate, Ligurian Genoa,
     Cornelia of Colombo of far sight,
     That, man and seer in one, had well been twain,
     And each a glory to his hills and sea;
     And past her a great band
     Bright garlanded or rich with purple skeins,
     And crimson mantles and queynt fineries
     That tarnished held but so the more
     Of dim allurement in their half-shown folds:
     So swept my vision o'er their filmy ranks,
     Then rose some opaque cloud,
     Whose name I have not yet discerned,
     And music as I heard it one clear night
     Within our earthly night's own mirroring,

     Where altar candles blazed out as dim stars,
     And all the gloom was soft, and shadowy forms
     Made and sang God, within the far-off choir.
     And in a clear space high behind
     Them and the tabernacle of that place,
     Two tapers shew the master of the keys
     As some white power pouring forth itself.

     And all the church rang low and murmured
     Thus in my dream of forms the music swayed.
     And I was lost in it and only woke
     When something like a mass bell rang, and then
     That white-foot wind, pale Dawn's annunciatrice.
     Me bore to earth again, but some strange peace
     I had not known so well before this swevyn
     Clung round my head and made me hate earth less.


In the Old Age of the Soul


     I do not choose to dream; there cometh on me
     Some strange old lust for deeds.
     As to the nerveless hand of some old warrior
     The sword-hilt or the war-worn wonted helmet
     Brings momentary life and long-fled cunning,
     So to my soul grown old -- 
     Grown old with many a jousting, many a foray,
     Grown old with many a hither-coming and hence-going -- 
     Till now they send him dreams and no more deed;
     So doth he flame again with might for action,
     Forgetful of the council of the elders,
     Forgetful that who rules doth no more battle,
     Forgetful that such might no more cleaves to him
     So doth he flame again toward valiant doing.

From Syria

    In April when I see all through
     Mead and garden new flowers blow,
     And streams with ice-bands broken flow,
     Eke hear the birds their singing do;
     When spring's grass-perfume floateth by
     Then 'tis sweet song and birdlet's cry
     Do make mine old joy come anew.

     Such time was wont my thought of old
     To wander in the ways of love.
     Burnishing arms and clang thereof,
     And honour-services manifold
     Be now my need. Whoso combine
     Such works, love is his bread and wine,
     Wherefore should his fight the more be bold.

     Song bear I, who tears should bring
     Sith ire of love mak'th me annoy,
     With song think I to make me joy.
     Yet ne'er have I heard said this thing:
     He sings who sorrow's guise should wear.
     Natheless I will not despair
     That sometime I'll have cause to sing.

     I should not to despair give way
     That some while I'll my lady see.
     I trust well He that lowered me
     Hath power again to make me gay.
     But if e'er I come to my Love's land
     And turn again to Syrian strand,
     God keep me there for a fool, alway!

     God for a miracle well should
     Hold my coming from her away,
     And hold me in His grace alway
     That I left her, for holy-rood.
     An I lose her, no joy for me,
     Pardi, hath the wide world in fee.
     Nor could He mend it, if He would.

     Well did she know sweet wiles to take
     My heart, when thence I took my way.
     'Thout sighing, pass I ne'er a day
     For that sweet semblance she did make
     To me, saying all in sorrow:
     Sweet friend, and what of me to-morrow?
     Love mine, why wilt me so forsake?


     ENVOI

     Beyond sea be thou sped, my song,
     And, by God, to my Lady say
     That in desirous, grief-filled way
     My nights and my days are full long.
     And command thou William the Long-Seer
     To tell thee to my Lady dear,
     That comfort be her thoughts among.

From the Saddle

D'AUBIGNE TO DIANE


     Wearied by wind and wave death goes
     With gin and snare right near alway
     Unto my sight. Behind me bay
     As hounds the tempests of my foes.
     Ever on ward against such woes,
     Pistols my pillow's service pay,
     Yet Love makes me the poet play.
     Thou know'st the rime demands repose,
     So if my line disclose distress,
     The soldier and my restlessness
     And teen, Pardon, dear Lady mine,
     For since mid war I bear love's pain
     'Tis meet my verse, as I, show sign
     Of powder, gun-match and sulphur stain.




Marvoil


     A poor clerk I, Arnaut the less they call me,
     And because I have small mind to sit
     Day long, long day cooped on a stool
     A-jumbling o' figures for Maitre Jacques Polin,
     I ha' taken to rambling the South here.

     The Vicomte of Beziers's not such a bad lot.
     I made rimes to his lady this three year:
     Vers and canzone, till that damn'd son of Aragon,
     Alfonso the half-bald, took to hanging
     _His_ helmet at Beziers.
     Then came what might come, to wit: three men and one woman,
     Beziers off at Mont-Ausier, I and his lady
     Singing the stars in the turrets of Beziers,
     And one lean Aragonese cursing the seneschal
     To the end that you see, friends:

     Aragon cursing in Aragon, Beziers busy at Beziers -- 
     Bored to an inch of extinction,
     Tibors all tongue and temper at Mont-Ausier,
     Me! in this damn'd inn of Avignon,
     Stringing long verse for the Burlatz;
     All for one half-bald, knock-knee'd king of the Aragonese,
     Alfonso, Quatro, poke-nose.

     And if when I am dead
     They take the trouble to tear out this wall here,
     They'll know more of Arnaut of Marvoil
     Than half his canzoni say of him.
     As for will and testament I leave none,
     Save this: Vers and canzone to the Countess of Beziers
     In return for the first kiss she gave me.
     May her eyes and her cheek be fair
     To all men except the King of Aragon,
     And may I come speedily to Beziers
     Whither my desire and my dream have preceded me.
     O hole in the wall here! be thou my jongleur
     As ne'er had I other, and when the wind blows,
     Sing thou the grace of the Lady of Beziers,
     For even as thou art hollow before I fill thee with
           this parchment,
     So is my heart hollow when she filleth not mine eyes,
     And so were my mind hollow, did she not fill utterly
           my thought.

     Wherefore, O hole in the wall here,
     When the wind blows sigh thou for my sorrow
     That I have not the Countess of Beziers
     Close in my arms here.
     Even as thou shalt soon have this parchment.

     O hole in the wall here, be thou my jongleur,
     And though thou sighest my sorrow in the wind,
     Keep yet my secret in thy breast here;
     Even as I keep her image in my heart here.



Revolt

Against the crepuscular spirit in

modern poetry


     I would shake off the lethargy of this our time,
       and give
     For shadows -- shapes of power
     For dreams -- men.

     It is better to dream than do?
                               Aye! and, No!

     Aye! if we dream great deeds, strong men,
     Hearts hot, thoughts mighty.

     No! if we dream pale flowers,
     Slow-moving pageantry of hours that languidly
     Drop as o'er-ripened fruit from sallow trees.
     If so we live and die not life but dreams,
     Great God, grant life in dreams,
     Not dalliance, but life!

     Let us be men that dream,
     Not cowards, dabblers, waiters
     For dead Time to reawaken and grant balm
     For ills unnamed.

     Great God, if we be damn'd to be not men but only dreams,
     Then let us be such dreams the world shall tremble at
     And know we be its rulers though but dreams!
     Then let us be such shadows as the world shall tremble at
     And know we be its masters though but shadow!

     Great God, if men are grown but pale sick phantoms
     That must live only in these mists and tempered lights
     And tremble for dim hours that knock o'er loud
     Or tread too violent in passing them;

     Great God, if these thy sons are grown such thin ephemera,
     I bid thee grapple chaos and beget
     Some new titanic spawn to pile the hills and stir
     This earth again.




And Thus in Nineveh


     Aye! I am a poet and upon my tomb
     Shall maidens scatter rose leaves
     And men myrtles, ere the night
     Slays day with her dark sword.

     Lo! this thing is not mine
     Nor thine to hinder,
     For the custom is full old,
     And here in Nineveh have I beheld
     Many a singer pass and take his place
     In those dim halls where no man troubleth
     His sleep or song.
     And many a one hath sung his songs

     More craftily, more subtle-souled than I;
     And many a one now doth surpass
     My wave-worn beauty with his wind of flowers,
     Yet am I poet, and upon my tomb
     Shall all men scatter rose leaves
     Ere the night slay light
     With her blue sword.

     It is not, Raama, that my song rings highest
     Or more sweet in tone than any, but that I
     Am here a Poet, that doth drink of life
     As lesser men drink wine.




The White Stag


     I ha' seen them mid the clouds on the heather.
     Lo! they pause not for love nor for sorrow,
     Yet their eyes are as the eyes of a maid to her lover,
     When the white hart breaks his cover
     And the white wind breaks the morn.

          _'Tis the white stagy Fame, we're a-hunting,
          Bid the world's hounds come to horn!_




_Piccadilly_


     _Beautiful, tragical faces,_
     _Ye that were whole, and are so sunken;_
     _And, O ye vile, ye that might have been loved,_
     _That are so sodden and drunken,_
                       _Who hath forgotten you?_

     _O wistful, fragile faces, few out of many!_

     _The gross, the coarse, the brazen,_
     _God knows I cannot pity them, perhaps, as I should do,_
     _But, oh, ye delicate, wistful faces,_
                       _Who hath forgotten you?_

NEW POEMS FOR HORTUS CONCLUSUS
SONG
O hard Voluptuary,
Cruel Time,
Why must your quarry
Limp in rhyme;
Has every hour a bloodless heart, Or is each hour a whole, not
part?

DAMSON AND MEDLAR
These two keep summer in their lips Till their slow fruit the
hoar-frost sips,
That mouth of winter on deep summer's mouth Bears sweet
plenty from sad drouth;
And O, their heavy towers above Are night and day to owl and
dove.
Their thick flowers shut these birds away Though in that dark
the boughs make day.
O what can sleep be in that light
Of myriad flower-eyes touched with sight,
All looking for the dove's long croon,
Their sad meridian, their noon?
What dreams of other life than this Lived in another emphasis,
Where boughs of lively coral turn To meadows by the river's
urn?
Far down those fields sad conches ring To crews of tritons
winnowing,
Medlar and damson are two isles,
Two trees above the mermaid's smile,

While knights in scaly armour ride In scallop shells the
spangled tide By woods of crystal and of coral That break,
now, with the dove's sad moral.
So these fruits of summer flame
Hang late on their sweet gallow-frame, Turned ripe with rain
tears and the frost, Most happy when they most have lost;
If tasted in the rime's white fang They answer to the conch that
rang,
And give you summer in their lips Though their heat the hoar-frost sips.

THE TWO ALMOND TREES
While Cupid and Campaspe played Their castle was an
almond shade,
Its mullions lay near above
The cards that were their risks of love,
Its battlements as soft as eyes Frowned not, and their shafts
made sighs.
That sweet breath on dead King and Queen Freshed them, now
they reign between 
The white towers of the almond fort 
And
where Campaspe holds her court, Cupid, blinded, gets his sight
And plays the knave in wanton might.
This Kingdom with white cliffs that smell. These sweet fields
each a honey cell,
This almond world where wood is amber 
And bonfires leave a
scented ember,
O what can be the mar to this,
Its death -- or metamorphosis ?
One day they drove along their coast 
By foam-white shores
that were their boast Cupid made another land
And put it near that snowy strand ;
This was red, and theirs was white,
Yet both were almonds flow'ring bright.
Now that cloud of scents is gone,
The storax and the cinnamon
This India of white towers have flown
To reach that redder honey town,
They store that other almond bough 
While this in wide-eyed
snow falls now.
Campaspe and those spices changed 
And cards and Cupid
there are ranged, 
They play for kisses, the red walls Of this
new almond are their halls,
Yet it's their garden, for these bricks 
So sweedy myrrh and
cassia mix.
Dead King and Queen are born again 
And Cupid's Knave to
their bright train ; 
Where India was, now Cathay lies,
So deep's the difference in these skies,
For skins like coffee, or like clove,
He'll give a jasmine flower to love.
This other kingdom, other world,
Drifts as though its sails are furled 
Down tides of spring that
run so far W'e see the axles of our star ;
Why else should almonds have two kinds 
Unless to let us
change our minds ?
And so in these spring fires we see 
All that is honey to the bee

And more besides, for in this choice 
There's sight and hearing,
scent and voice, In two kinds, lest the same should be – 
That's
never true of almond tree.
With Cupid and Campaspe dead 
The spring has lost its
fountain-head,
Its castles, red and white, blow sweet 
Yet never feel their
winged feet,
But still the snowflakes fall -- and this 
Tells us if cold ghosts
can kiss.

PEAR TREE
This and this ripen in the rime's white hour
At spikes of new frost into a summer of few days
Such stony hearts to cells of swee tness turned
That in this sudden favour of the mutual boughs
Must lie some secret that is shut in their similitude
While they load like rain the dropping green of their branches.
Are they lovers at this last hour still asleep
Who drifted into slumber at foamed windows in the blossom
While they lay through spring hours upon that cream or snow
of honey 
And the bees to their matrix came, and every wind
that blew 
Crumbled the tree of snow and rattled at foamed
windows?
Then every sigh was a white sail loosened
Spoiling the cerulean voyage of lovers in the casement
For all mouths but theirs did they censure in their strictness
And nothing breathed or moved but in the prison of their
bodies
At that ledge against the blue world,
Where they leaned, they fell asleep
And the sails and towers of blossom turned to cold,
unconscious stone.
Then spring into green summer blew.
While they slept in sour, cold silence;
Now they waken in soft words at spikes of frost alarmed.

PLUM TREE
The burden of these heavy plums Bears me down, I drown in
gums,
Stay help me while the boughs I pull To fill another basketful:
The lowest lie so near the ground That in a storeyed tower I'm
bound.
If these were blossoms and not fruit Then this would be a
flower-suit,
For flowers I could not breathe or stir. Though it's not death,
but deadlier :
And he would be a giant indeed Not fainting with that flower-seed.
That death from so much scent has gone, I've pruned the
branches one by one And yet they're plums enough to share,
Two livings part this prisoned air :
It is no ghost -- she'd surely waste
This plum-world where no death we taste.

HAWTHORN
O hawthorn spray,
O fount of snow,
To your boughs I'll rise and go;

I'm weary in the still spring air
And find a grievance everywhere:
Your snow on this blue fire of day Snares my sense and takes
away The apple-breast and apple-cheek I came into this wood
to seek.
O hapless, luckless
Hawthorn bough,
No sooner do I sleep, than, now,
That fine and self-same ghost I see Made one with your white
hawthorn-tree; In this you mingle will and fate,
Like this you are unfortunate;
Your lovely snow makes sleep alive,
And death becomes your honey-hive.
O hawthorn shade,
O snowy sleep,
Your crooning silence I would keep And never want this
dream to break While hawthorn-boughs a breath can shake; I
waken, but I'll quietly lie Your honied sleep once more to try:
I'll find my apples in your snow,
And ever to the hawthorn go.


APRICOT
This hot and shuttered hour I tried An apricot that grew
outside,
Its sunny flesh, and stone within,
I ate here, for the light is thin,
And then I thought with bitterness How love lives long in
loneliness.
The apricot on its red wall I make my symbol, counting all Its
changes in the sun's great scale For pauses in sweet love's sad
gale,
For ever sighing, though it lulls,
And then our chilly wine it mulls.
So love in lonely hours will heat,
The heart in this dark room will beat, And though the fruit is
big with stone, Sweet flesh to that dead, sullen bone, This
apricot is not my all;
I will find others on the wall.


TULIP TREE
Whose candles light the tulip tree?
What is this subtle alchemy,
That builds an altar in one night And touches the green boughs
with light ? Look at the shaped leaves below And see the
scissor-marks they show,
As if a tailor had cut fine The marking of their every line!
These are no leaves of prudery
Hiding what all eyes should see;
No Adam and no Eve lie hid Below this leafy coverlet:
The long limbs of that flower-hid girl Would need no leaves to
twist and curl, The markings of that leaf-hid boy Want no
flowers to mar and cloy.
And so these cut leaves and their lights Live only for the tulip-rites

At this altar of bright fires, Sweet-scented, lest their ardour
tires Leaf, and flower, and scent are all Alive for this lit
interval:
Between two winters are they born To make great summer
seem forlorn.

PAULOVNIA This tree,
Blue cloud, blue tower,
Blue cage,
Is fortress of the flower-age;
Its winter siege it has withstood With poetry stored,
As forts with food;
But lay Campaspe on that cloud,
Its summer sweetness is her shroud Nor Ganymede, nor Hylas
live,
For none can touch this honey-hive.
Whoever cats this honey-spoil Is mad for all his life's long toil.
Another world
We must rehearse,
Where nothing dies,
And summer's purse
Her colour pours to all beside This cloud, this tower,
This tree's blue pride.
Then poets on the air's bare screen Make flow the images
they've seen, Lorn nightingales, long waterfalls, To eclogues
turn, and madrigals.
Nothing stirs, these deep, long days,
But boughs of blossom, flowers of praise
Great trumpets
Stab the air they chum,
The sedge of reeds,
The river's um,
Made lively with this sound of war Sigh, wave-like,
On a bitter shore;
Then this cage of kings will move Down winds of cinnamon
and clove,
And nothing can this kingdom kill Of peacock's wing and
swan's sharp quill
Such beauty breathes, and will not fade, All summer, in this
tree's blue shade.

SNOWFLOWERS
Before the cuckoo in the elm Has come back from his
Indian realm We'll watch these other Asias bum, As proud as
he is, each in turn.
The crocus shining through the snow Climbs, as sun does,
from below Till all his brothers on that white Catch the breath
and snare the sight; The yellow jockeys shine post-haste, For
they have little time to waste,
One week, at most, they ride with day Burning their bright
clothes away;

No longer do the blue flowers live Though sweet as any
honey-hive:
Yet all this Orient in the snow Pales for me, its colours go,
Where all's harmonious, nothing sins; I most prefer the
Harlequins,
Who these two colours meet and mix And in themselves this
India fix,
They keep its double strength until The leaves stir with the
cuckoo's bill And one more Orient, that of air, Melts the dead
snow everywhere; Then this crocus harlequin Is last where
that bright play has been, His fading colours droop and die To
mockery from the elm near by.
Wasp, a spurred and striped hussar, Rides near to where these
honeys are; And the snub-nosed bee goes by, Loud-winged,
and laden fearfully,
Yet neither of them stay their wing, Or stop to search this
humble thing.
For here there is no scent to catch These robbers at their
flower-watch, They wait on the red campion, Sweet sentinel,
tierce champion,
Or hover by a primrose-bed Long after the spring day is dead.
They never find this flower-core For all the leaf that comes
before.


LORDS AND LADIES
Blue veins and long hands of birth Lie hidden in this hard,
dark earth : Tears of rain bring them, at last,
Into a fresh and new, green past,
For these weepings on their tomb Bring life into that sleeping
womb.
Each with green sleeves and green hood These lords and ladies
of the wood Play loud summer's game of chance Into a sleepy
permanence,
So safe are they from plund'ring bees, So tall and silent are the
trees.
Yet this green and humble cowl Holds a brimming honey-bowl.
And so these lords and ladies play Their cribbage through the
high noon-day ; The satyr at his nettle-wine
Counted them, and they were nine,
Three Kings and Queens, and three beside, Who dawdled
through the deep noon-tide.
And then he threw, to help their game, Three hazards that were
all the same,
He lost, and by that bitter throw,
This year, when to their tomb they go, They'll sink into a
winter-sleep,
Nor wake when the spring rains loud weep.
What wasp and bee so often missed Is struck down with the
satyr's fist.


WALLFLOWERS
These flowers are middle-age set forth, Their southern savour
seeks the north Where crystal cells and snowy prisons Keep
memory clear till old age wizens; Then pick two stems and
ask for news Of Indian snows and Spanish dews;
How poetry sang to pipes of amber This yellow wallflower
may remember, And her red sister you may ply,
W'ho'll answer, but not tell you why.
So hold a stem in either hand,
These stolen thoughts, this contraband, Build images of their
sweet air Till poetry holds them everywhere ;
But keep your breath and shut your eyes, The honied sleep of
this disguise Tells you how, but never why,
And in this lies its poetry;
The red and yellow by the wall Are beauty's birth and beauty's
pall.
Breathe deep into one crumbling tower, Then save it for the
other flower,
You lift on one great wave of spice And meet that other
paradise;
In the dead summer's long-drawn heat Dead Colonel
Fantock's heart will beat He'll live beside me for a time But
die before I've found a rhyme,
And so to my first flower I turn,
Fresh breathing, while he seeks his urn.
Red flower to yellow, each to each,
We change as a new world we reach,
Breath on breath, sweet gale on gale, Are summers that our
eyes exhale;
But if I throw the wallflowers down Then summer with cold
death is sown, This garden that was full of flowers Is now a
wreck of broken towers ; Bend but to lift one, and you'll find
The tomb of poetry for your mind.


WHITE HYACINTH
For flower of day's pale light, I'll say The hyacinth, sweet
foot of day,
Still smelling of the star's wet w'ood In midday's high and
lonely mood ; The gales from that Ilcspcrides This keeps and
stores up for the bees, Who little know while at their honey,
This liquid gold is alien money.
Yet, while they eat, the taste is strange And drowsiest of their
winged range ; For hyacinth never sleeps, the dew Fast drying,
as the stars get few,
Finds that foot of day awake : Night-honey's there for bees to
take.

KINGCUPS
When poetry walked the live, spring wood, Hid, ghostlike, in
the leaves' green hood She came to a slant fence of sun,
Whose golden timbers, one by one,
Trod into a marsh's toils
And here she stayed her flowery spoils;

But pitying the marshes' plight She shook her lap, and wide
and bright Great kingcups to that waste she threw Where
nothing lived, and nothing grew ; Now, where poetry passed,
there stays The light of suns, the fire of days,
And these cups for kings to hold Make summer with their
wide-eyed gold.
These cowslips in a spring-night born Grow gentle soft and
wear no thorn, Then roll their sweetness to a ball, The hush of
breath, confining all, Makes orange-smell and lemon-scent
Into a flowery parliament Where every cowslip talks as one,
And nothing, but that scent, is done.

DANDELION
These lions, each by a daisy queen,
With yellow manes, and golden mien,
Keep so still for wind to start They stare, like eyes that have no
smart. But, once they hear that shepherd pipe, Down meadows
and through orchards ripe, They dance together, lion and
daisy, Through long midday, slow and lazy;
Each dandelion in his fierce lust Forgets the sunset's reddy
rust,
Now by night winds roughly kissed His mane becomes a clock
of mist Which mortal breath next morn will blow, While his
white virgins bloom below.

COWSLIPS
Our orange-wood and lemon-glade No higher than the grass is
laid;
You could not walk beneath its bells Rung heavy with the
orchard smells. But bend down to the cow's soft lip And see
the honey bmps they sip.

WARNING
Your world of beauty to Time's clock Will parch like a
desert, shut like a lock;
How long, how long, before the tooth of Time Treats you like
this, turns you to rhyme;
Your dove-like voice to asinine smart bray Shaped by fashion
like these words I say,
But quicker dead, and fast forgotten,
Though my late fruit are ripe when rotten.
Pay heed, then, to the sun's hot chimes Heavy honied from the
castle limes,
My halls of fancy, high and free,
Hold symbols both for you and me.
These words are worn and hewn to shape,
Age, who knows not girl from ape,
Will quench these eyes that now I love And ruffle my
fire -- breasted dove,
Those lips he'll almost bum away:
A ghost, not mine, some summer day Who helps that slow fire
with his kiss Will halt when he remembers this:
Then I shall be more dead than you,
But not these words I turn to hew.


VARIATION UPON OLD LINES ON THE
HARLEQUIN
No more shall old Bologna -- old alack! Once he was
young and diamonded all o'er -- 
Dance the matchless fling so loved of yore.
He died at Glasgow in a creaking attic,
Crippled, half-blind, gone rheumatic.
This dead knight of the fiery spangles,
Who died upon the cold's cruel rack,
Danced with Clown Grimaldi on his back.
I'll take him through Bologna's square Where bronze
Neptune breaks the air Into this orchard of cool shade,
Yet near the noise that fountain made;
Here, to evenings' diamond eyes,
Where spangled boughs and tree-stems rise,
He'll cut his capers in the dew
And while we watch his dance die through
Wc see that fountain on the air
Hang still and never shatter there;
Like this, we know he'll never die Till Neptune's dead,
and rain is dry,
He'll live long in the fountain shade Another John
Bologna made,
While there's rain his colours last,
His spangles live while clouds go past.

DERBYSHIRE BLUEBELLS
The wood is one blue flame of love,
It trembles with the thrush and dove;
Who is this honey-beacon for,
That burns this once, then never more?
Whose lutes hide in the young green leaves?
Who sorrows here when no one grieves?
The misty spaces in the boughs,
No shout will fill, no stone will rouse,
If at those panes we beat in vain Why hope to quench that fire
with rain ? Why beat the bluebells down to find How fire and
honey are combined?
There is no space for foot to tread Unless you bruise the
flower-head,
No corner where you cannot hear The dove's long croon, the
thrush sing near, Like bells out of the trees' tall spires These
songs above the bluebell fires.
This fire of little bells, sweet eyes,
Climbs into the dove-throat skies,
It shines, as here, at Bolsover And to that Venus is a lover;
It bums in all the haunted woods And marries with the castle's
moods.
Stone Venus on her fountain ledge,
Can see above the hornbeam hedge The only fire that climbs to
her,
For sun and moon shine down on her;
And these can only reach the brim,
If they were winged seraphim,
Not bluebells, but bright angels' plumes, Then burning where
the sun illumes This sharp blue fire would be her lover And
she would need no other cover,
With thrush and dove for beating heart And bluebells hiding
every part.
The casement in the castle wall
Hears the Venus fountain call,

The lutes, long dead, ring out again And beauty like a gentle
rain Shines on each thing that has died,
Made live now with the bluebell tide.
This world of few days and few nights, These fancies that this
blue invites,
Seeks the dark, the light it shuns,
And haunts the clouded mullions,
This honey music of the spring It winnows with the pigeon's
wing.
So where deep peace should be, and quiet, These ghosts fill
with the lute's loud riot, They hold a noisy tournament Half-hidden 
in the bluebell's scent,
And Venus is but dimly seen
For lute strings and the flowers' blue screen.
We leave that mist for Renishaw
And tall elms where the rooks do caw;
But when I walk our silent woods,
Now broken with the dove's sad moods, Not Venus, nor her
lutes, I miss,
Nor find our bluebells honeyless.

FOUR VARIATIONS UPON WILLIAM
BROWNE OF TAVISTOCK

`The Mulberry (His Black from Thisbe Taking`
Two lovers with stone wall between Lay near me while my
boughs were green,
A loose stone broke their lips' long seal While I could shade
that lovers' meal;
Their red mouths my red fruit could match.
Their red with mine they darker turned, Tired lips with my red
berries burned,
And then this lover's mark to hide They pulled where my ripe
fruit did ride And robbed their love-nest, my warm thatch.
My ripest berries in the stream
They held to break that water-beam And washed their hands
and faces white,
My reddest mulberries can requite,
They only my dark ghost can kill.
And yet my after-kiss, my rest,
I've darker made for beauty's test.
This once you have forgotten me,
My Pyramus, my sunny Thisbe;
I'll hide your love-marks with my stain.
A lion wind in the yellow corn Leaped and then their death was
born, Each slew the other to escape And all great Babylon
knew the rape ; They found them in the harvest slain.
For this I have my gipsy hue,
My fruit is red but it bums through,
My black stains on the face and hands, Each true lover
understands;
My dark from Thisbe I have taken.
I'm black from Thisbe's sunburnt shade, And yet this secret I
have made,
My red for kisses, black for sorrow,
In water die, and have no morrow ;
So reach the boughs no wind has shaken.



The Mulberry (Second Version)
I hid poor Thisbe at her sill And dyed my mulberry mark
until It matched her lover's gipsy hue,
My dark from Thisbe I have taken,
With Pyramus no kiss can waken,
And for that deed here is my due.
They're gone from Babylon to a land Of saffron skin and
jasmine hand,
These two fair gipsies of my stain Live ever there and are
not slain;
Breaths of nutmeg, gales of spice,
Are stone walls to their Paradise;
The gap, or sill, at which they kiss The green-sleeve wind
can hardly miss,
He'll roof them like my ancient shade,
For this were silkworms surely made,
That while I feed them with my leaf These worms will
spin a silken sheaf,
And Thisbe, though she's dark indeed, Lights the
mulberry silk I feed.

Apple Song 
Apple woods, ripe breasts of
cyder,
Stand higher than the horse and rider;
And who could count the heads of corn So thick they'd
hide the dragon's horn? Oaten eclogues, applesongs,
Who could tell of winter's thongs;
(Of thistle's milky nourishment,
And earth, one open, icy casement;)
For cyder, and the sky's blue panes,
When spring wind turns the cockerel's vanes And sun
from his locked chamber shows, Who'll plump the apple, paint
the rose,
And shine above these homely towns Sweetly environed
with the daisied downs?

Quince
The stomach's comforter, the pleasing quince, Make ripe for
me, to get me hence,
For in that safety of calm dreams Where in my sleep I move, it
seems,
I'll walk in saffron shades among The nutmeg and the
cinnamon And lie on some soft bank to shale This plenty of
that scented vale.
I like their scent and not their taste,
I'll give them to the winds to waste,
That they can blow my thoughts along From this bank of
shadow song To the true world of quinces where No other
spices load the air,
And there my wand'ring shade will stay, Content with quinces
all the day.

VARIATION ON A THEME BY ROBERT
HERRICK
You lily-beds and lily-plains
Where nothing bleeds and nothing stains, What is your winter,
when my hand Grows heated with a lily brand?
Since a clenched handful warms me so We'll count the
miracles of snow And see the crocus-fires new-lit Shine
through their lily-coverlet,
This train of fire that spreads so fast Bums out and from that
winter-last The snowdrop's humble honey bell Sighs, ghost-like, in a lily's cell.


These snowy nunneries must spoil To help the summer's day-long toil,
Their sweet breath and sweet eyes new-born Live in the lily-wristed morn.
He'll search the myrtles for shy Daphne And she will turn back
from her tree, But if he finds the almond-maid He'll linger, by
her sweets waylaid.
And Daphne, as a ghost, will walk Where rose and almond
softly talk.

VARIATION UPON A COUPLET OF ALEXANDER
POPE
Groves of myrtle and loud trumpet-glitter Die back on this
dead waste of snows,
Where never almond bloomed,
Nor the wild rose,
Whose breath against that cloudy shade Might shake the snow-breast almond-maid.
But let these grow here, may their scent Make the deathless
cold relent.
Then, where Maeotis sleeps, there'll be Woods of myrtle and
of Daphne,
That girl is safe here from her lover With rose and almond for
a cover,
Where no one breathes that twice-sweet gale Except the
blackthroat nightingale.
Was this, before, a waste of snows,
For, now, Tanais sings and flows :
A choir of water that excels The lute-tongues in her wood's
green dells ? Maeotis breaks her sleep and moves To music
that her myrtle loves,
The hero's trumpet sounds again In boughs that glitter, bright
as rain.

WATER-SONG, AN ADAPTATION FROM JOHN
MILTON
Hard beaten by the sun's cruel thong I fainted at this water-song;
It cooled me with the words it said All the time my sense had
fled,
But when I woke, that lily-mask Hid the lips that were my task.
And so the summer sleep I took Kept me at this glassy brook;
Its mirror-cave took me inside But hid the truth in its chill tide,
Though lily-masked she would not play,
Thus did I lose that spangled day.
She would not leave her water-world For all my rage, my
lightning hurled,
Scarce breathing that I made no mist Then roughly shaken
with rude fist,
But the water nymph ne'er showed Till night upon the water
rode.
Then, in the dark, this cherry-tree,
Red-lipped as her I longed to see,
She may have climbed, for aught I know,
And lying on that bough in snow Was little more than
moonlight there With only amber-dropping hair.

But those tears I never knew,
Nor found the cherries sweet with dew,
Because I hid for her again
And came forth when the night was slain;
I had no time for else beside
Her shadow in the glassy tide.
Thus, through another day I burn And cool not with the
brook's chill um ; Sabrina, for dear honour's sake,
Fair goddess of the silver lake,
Come forth to me and show me fair Your body, and your
amber hair.

COUNTERSONG
O kind voluptuary,
Sweet Time,
Since this poetry
Speaks in rhyme;
Then, ever, this will beat with heart, My poetry is a whole, not
part.

THE RENISHAW WOODS Thin woods among these
collieries but hide and blur their noise Till you'd think a red
cavern and a forge were there
With smoky gods at some hot anvil;
But this wood is three valleys, it is half a forest,
And we'll walk to find the river and the dying mill.
In young chivalry we loved meek rabbits
And the humble wool-bearers on close-cropped fields
But soon we had lost ourselves in the cool, magic shade
In three valleys and three fancies
And had come to the flowers that rise and fall in ferny wind,
Where dragon tongues strike against sweet, rainy brims In
those spires of music the blue Canterbury bells :
And the fox-glove, dyed and painted, in this innocent green
shade,
That drops his flowers for fairy hands to try Fitting their
fingers to that sweet pomander,
Though now it prisons them in velvet fetters,
Is a tower of honey-cups where dandy wasps pay call Who are
the Swiss Guards to the power that dwells In darkest-pillared,
most stag-antlered elm:
Some `lords and ladies` out of the lush spring have lasted
And grow in dark places where their games of hazard
Outlive the mocking herald to their wars of love,
This bird from Indian valleys who has known
Such patternings of sun and rain
As raised living pawns out of one torrid night,
Flowers, barred with tigers' fire and in green flames of parrots
dipped, Who play at their loves through the noisy noonday
shade.
In dark shadow did these `lords and ladies ` play their old
cribbage. Hiding, for their green hoods still hold
The trumpets of the tournament, the green sleeves of the
ladies,
And all the flights of fancy which to their dreams they formed
From blue veins and white hands of birth.
Red campion stands sentinel to these nodding hoods
At a brake of dank nettles, near the dock-leaf's balm,
For the poisoned thicket and its cure are always near,

Red campion, ragged soldier on the wood's wet paths,
Warned us of the nettles that are crushed for satyr's wine
And we stumbled at his vineyard that the spider hangs
With frosty nets, and is the fisherman to mind them
Waiting at her webwork like the moon among her clouds.
We were shepherds to our thoughts out of the tree's green tent,
Moving through high corn, or down sea-fields of grass:
We saw castle windows in the lime's sweet mist
And moved to an arrogant fine sound of hoofs
On a Polish plain of trees, white-barked,
To another castle in a sedge of weed
With rushes like turbaned heads to that sad shore,
Where we listened for music,
And only heard the sighing rain.
These showers among green reeds, like rolling drums were
hushed, And we were back in the faunal silence that no word
can break, Waist deep in bracken,
With two-edged swords of ferns set round,
In hoarse smell of wet mustiness,
While ash-berries, red talismans of autumn mist,
That are sharp whetstones for the beaks of birds
Turn redder in the fern's wet breath
And will only ripen when winter's first white rime
Makes leaves and grass to sparkle like the spider's net.
Touch, now, these boughs and see the shower of pearls
That fall in grain and dash their drums upon the ground,
For this is August heat, to hang the trees with dew
Giving all that's green this soft, still rain for food
That is born with never wind or cloud
To run with it in goatskins down the causeways of the air,
Untying that thin goatneck where the rain should fall.
Leaves in dark places, like those `lords and ladies`
Are still at their summer, though those trumpets have passed
on,
The full, brassy kettle-drums of throbbing heat
Die, but keep their substance in a slow, slow brake on Time
And drag by very heaviness their fate towards them.
How young, oh I how young we were when first our feet
Walked in this wood below a summer sun
That burned like a red fire in the trees!
Seven long summers like a week of days were spent
And we'd grown to fit our coffins;
This wood where we wander every month of August
Let this be our watershed, our edge of old and new.
Darker grows the wood with more inwoven shade
To its saturnine, black, inmost heart
And shaking their rattles in a snatch of wind
Giant hemlocks, dry as death, and taller than dead towers of
bones, Hold their poison higher than the nettle brakes,
Too high for the spider's line to hold its catch In breaks of hot
wind between the August boughs;
And through these same green windows, green the waters Of
sky, leaf-parted, with but one white sail shown We heard that
beating, troubled heart,
The water-mill, sad mischief of the wood's green hours,
And walked to it, now soft, now loud, while we listened for the
river's
voice
Till, at a blue gulf in the trees' close shade,
We reached the singing water on its bed of smooth stones
That plays like the sea, in lieu of shells, with rounded pebbles
Rolled for low music to the stream's shrill note In a babble of
water-tongues.
It flowed by lichened stepping-stones,
By rocks, the bearded flute-stops in that sad, low tune,
Through a strait of steep banks into a sea of sun,
A still pool full of sleepy peace, a school of summer
harmonies,
Where the sun at green windows of the water,
Played like ocean with his shells,
The one, golden-haired and like a lion in boughs of water,
Mocking that white beard of winter shores and bitter rocks of
doom Who plays those dead flutes in soulless shells of pearl
Still breathing to that mortal shell the ear;

Like this we had two summers in one dying day,
The tree's green dances in the wind
And, Danae-like, their still towers for that golden rain
outstretched Once living, and in that river pool revived To the
touch of their sun-parent.
Yet these answered Heavens like a mist were scattered
At the pool's sheer glacier edge
Where the waters in one fall of fate dropped to the dark abyss
And were slaves in that catastrophe, were chained to the mills,
Cranking that gaunt water-wheel, from their lull top youth
down
crushed
Into one dark serfdom, bottomless, without bread of hope.
No clock is so cruel as this water-wheel,
For clocks must stop and, as well, they travel time
Moving, when their pulse beats, through all day and night
To some death that they foreshadowed with black shade an
hour before On that calendar of chance, dull circle with no
corners ;
But this mill, where never corn is ground, still turns in empty
air With no purpose, not in pleasure, not in labour pressed,
Eating in its idleness the slave strength to its yoke,
The waters, moaning at their work that sang, not long before.
Here, as sun with shadow, sea with shells on wet salt sand,
The mill Was true harvester.
Where waters like the First Flood pour through the mill-house
At broken rafters in the unminded roof
Ripe corn in its tied thickets heaped
Dyed the heartless pavers with its spilt soul of ripeness,
With mummy dust of kings in their gold tombs unwrapped.
But even dust has gone now with the stream's white fangs
And the pavers and the walls weep with lichen;
The corn fields of Eckington on the hillside higher than the
church tower And Ridgeway with black net of crow's lifted at
a footfall from its
fields of stubble
Have sent their harvests to another mill,
This mill that was true harvester now lifts his flail in vain for
them, And the stream slaves for ever and can have no rest.
The miller and his wife have gone.
The cockerel at his fanfare to their last march of sun
Stood on that stone bridge, the highest station for his watch,
And Was moved in a hen-coop before the sun rose high;
Yet, remembering the collieries,
The noise of a giant forge hid in the trees,
I knew that this bridge led to a pit in the deep woods,
A pit with slanted galleries before they sank real shafts,
And the coal-waggons rumbled on that high thin arch
By the mill-stream that worked in great thickets of the yellow
corn Crushing out their life into a white bread for men;
Their two paths crossing, their lives led side by side,
Like the nettles and the campion in this summer wood.
By now the `lords and ladies` in their green hoods Nod near          
to sleep,
The coal-pit and the mill are dead, the corn-lands are stubble,
But the nettles still hold wine for goats, and the campion
stands sentinel Holding the summer wood for ghostly trumpet
and black shapes of
shadow.

TWO PASTORAL POEMS

THE CYDER FEAST
Stoke guests, and all the monkish shades,
Here is no canvas for your tragedies;
Gold-armoured ghosts their waisted waspish din
Must keep from the apple-harvest,
There is no banquet-door, no drum unto their gauntlet,
Nor even wattles for our cloud-like lambs
To prison them in cells that are their bread and light;
Such reedy battlements no ghost can shake Who lives in his
own histories to trumpet sound Walking the long reaches of
what once were shores.
Where he paced, but never left, the spongy sand;
And thus our green summer, and the sea-lit night Fired by the
moonlight off that window in the world,
Are safe, there is no battery of beaten hopes,
No forlorn feaster in the mirror at our shoulder,
Who, unbidden, like the ghost he is, in dead leaves of summer
Should wait till we joined him;
No walls, no battlements, no haunted woods,
No stair for his feet, and not a door for his plumes to brush:
We are feasting without torches in thick shade of trees.
All day long in light or heavy branches
Did we toil at the virgins whose green sleeves of wind We
lifted and the cloth of leaves in breath of their own blowing
Laid back to loose the silver cords that held them,
Then apple after apple from that tree of bright globes Fell and
we gathered those Ephesian breasts Till the tree that living
goddess to dead statue turned And we left her in the apple-wood 
and moved our ladders To pluck in green sleeves at
other towers of sweetness,
All day among the turrets of that green world of winds We
wandered and hid chambers in the steep stairs found Where
apples, sunny honeycombs, in hidden windows hung,
Which we entered like robbers after bags of gold
And climbed from those window-sills too heavy for our
ladders
While the tree into dead statue turned at its cold sister's side.
All day while we were singing and the summer wind blew
sweet I heard the swollen mill-waters,
They were in our gentle branches like the drums of fate
While they ground their golden prisoners to a white and
shameful dust
And the fields, like our apple-trees, lay bruised and sore.
In a week the whole deep apple-wood We had sheared and
pruned for fruit
And we heaped it to rough pyramids below the very branches
So the rungs of our last ladders brimmed those houses of
bright cards, Thus fast did they crumble at a touch of hands;
Next day of all these pyramids we found some spilled,
Whether for their maidenhood the sorrowing boughs
Had pressed down in the wind's sad sighs
To feel those dewy cheeks once more and fan their slumber,
Or whether in the nightingale's black livery of death They
knew the apple-harvest and its last night of peace And had
come down to these pyramids from the forlorn leaves For one
last feasting till another sun of time.
But in the low, soft morning we struck the tents of fruit And
carried them in baskets to the cyder-press,
Spilling them in great rain into that slaughter-bowl Where they
fell, one on the other, like joined rain upon the window;
Through a second night they lay there, spoiled and brown from
the stone, With no boughs upon the dark wind roofing them,
And never tumbled, for no wing came near them.
Then, in that sister morning to the day before,
At low soft dawn we were standing by the cyder-press
And our horses, blinded for that day, were ready bandaged;
We tied them to the mill-stones and started those mute clocks
Which roll all day and never keep the hours
While through the apple-wood I listened for the mill-waters

And heard them crushing time into the white grain of winter;
Those hurried, swirling waters are no gauge of time,
Like a storm at flow of tide among the pointed rocks They
break, but never ebb in ordered courses of the hours,
And so we knew no moments but the march of sun,
Echoing his worn circles with our horses' tread
Until he dropped, fiery, through the plundered wood
And found no shining shields or burnished breasts of apples
Hung from the trees as in other burning evenings
When apples were their armour that they hung in the green
trees,
While they bathed, the naked warriors, in the stream above the
mill
And her young Leanders did each tree await
To climb into her leafy towers and find their Heros,
Both apple-naked in the windy shade.
What loves are in the night lanes
At their fires against the orchard wall?
They are black from gunpowder of the sun's alarms.
From smoke of his camp-fires by the skies' great tents,
All day flaming, while they move beneath him
And like the gipsies in the hidden lanes
They wander and have become a thousand fleets
Blown to four quarters of the wandering winds;
Thus go the gipsies in the sun's hot hours
And at his setting to this orchard of the burnished fruit
They point their swinging steps,
Not heeding the mill-stream for they do not reckon time,
They talk through all its throbbing as if it was their heart-beat;
This orchard is their garden who have never time for flowers
And must leave such towers that build themselves before these
reach
the light;
They climb the wall beating at the green sleeves of boughs
And are in the apple-orchard ; wet hedges are their nightly
beds,
But now these gipsies in the orchard-loves are lying Among
strong limbs from the river's tide Of warriors mating with the
maiden trees.
The moon, a whitened mill-stone, climbs from the cyder-press
And her fire lies on that anvil till her lifted flame Climbs from
the cyder-bowl, the troubled mill-waters In that night of secret
sighing let their voices rise;
They hide their idle master who has played her ghost Into the
waxing, waning night
And stolen in mimed sleep upon our apple-harvest,
Climbing out of our cyder-press as from a bed of love.
Our feast, our cup of apple-wine, begins at this signal
And we dance at the moon's disk till it climbs above our
hands,
Till from the presses' stony lips that ghost we cannot touch.
And if it moves, in mimic motion of the day's cruel task.
The miller is hidden in high towers of wind Who grinds the
night-harvest;
Those sails, like runged ladders we can never scale,
Thrash in the dark upon the reaping air
And cool our cyder feast with breaths of plenty.
Fan our gipsy darkness with your herbed gales,
So sweet your very harvest-death that thyme and nard and
cassia Drip from your honeycells and are your lips of wind!
This night, like daylight in the water depths
We can prison in our hands, or push its wall before us
Crumbling a barbican that yields so soon;
We wade in the moonlight and catching at a bough Dip its
dewy casements in the spangled tide,
Till the bole, the very tree-stem, is walled with this water And
light lies where the apples hung At the rails of our tall ladder.
Then the sweet gale riding with that sudden rampart Blew its
nard and cassia in deep breaths upon us And thyme lay in our
nostrils from the parcelled air That stood in three divisions of
such sweets around us ; The moon in highest branches of the
apple-wood Moved in slow measure with the lifted boughs,
Dancing at our cyder feast in that latticed hall of leaves


To music of her own gales in tubes of wind
Blown at the zephyrs' mouths;
And ghosts in the apple-wood at their dark trade of sighs
Turned in cloak and armour down the shadows
Till they pawned with the gipsies in wet hedges of sweet dew.
Song

My honeycomb, my cell of fire,
Lay up your wings and do not tire,
Let this summer bough pass by,
Its green flame suffer with no cry.
Your bow-like body bent with toil Let rest, and your fine
limbs uncoil,
While apple-branches, soft as sighs,
Wall in the world before your eyes.
We'll live among the woods' wet ways With rain and
thunder for Time's drummer, This short December of my days
With winter sadness in its summer,
And yet those sharp sounds of our clock Make thyme and
nard and cassia grow;
I'll love them, if they'll but unlock In throbbing rain and
thunder's brow
Those three divisions of the air
All blowing in this apple-wood
Suiting my cold or fiery mood.
Countersong
Since thyme and nard and cassia climb From rain and
thunder's shaken soil; Why should I count my crumbs of Time,
And for such meagre harvest toil?
The cold blue fire, the golden bell,
My eyes and hair made for your words I'll shape to things
you cannot spell And kill you with these treble swords.
For thyme and nard and cassia change My hair's gold bell,
my eyes' blue range ; Let bum my gipsy darkness where Your
three sweets blew the parcelled air.
Against your three divisions lie My three fierce emblems
for your eye ; Then will my sunburnt gold seem sweet As
thyme, rain-trampled, to your feet,
And nard be my soft bell's low note,
My cold blue eyes for cassia blow
In apple-alleys where you go!
Song
O thyme, O nard, O cassia joined,
Three breaths in one breath breathe again; My shrunken
hours, now hipped and groined, Build me a summer of sweet
rain.
Down the soft sighing of your showers The green lanes of the
gipsies stretch;
We'll wander in those streets of towers And hide ourselves for
Time to fetch.
 
He'll march upon our happy night
Of apple breast and apple cheek;
He'll bring your golden bell to sight,
And find the sharp lips that I seek.

My cyder feast, your gipsy fire.
Both die along the rainy wind;
But now your gold bell speaks to me. And so I faint out
happily.
Your sunburnt fairness, gold on gold, Finds tongue to say
Time passes on ; Yet with your sharp lips was I sold.

THE CHAMBER IDYLL
In time of year
When cherry-trees enticing burdens bear.
He that with wreathed legs doth upwards go,
Plucks not alone for those which stand below;
But now and then is seen to pick a few
To please himself as well as all his crew,
Or if from where he is he do espy
An apricock upon a bough thereby
Which overhangs the tree on which he stands,
Climbs up and strives to take it with his hands
Climb your tree-stair, sleepy wind,
And mix my slumber with your shepherd voice.
For I am hidden in the dumb, black night,
The black hood of magic is about my head;
Make run with the river in the poplar leaves My mute and
tragic listlessness,
And lift those ashen spangles to rehearse my changes;
For I'll move in their mutations,
March my diadems and paper crowns with them Till we meet
in darker woods, great wind,
Where the fawn lies by its dappled hind,
At a brake of spiked nettles, at the spiders' looms;
By that pied softness do your deeper notes
Soothe their ferny sleep into a valley of green bracken,
Where they wander, like my fancy, to your shepherd notes.
For my mute and tragic listlessness
Breaks like the night into a main of clustered sails,
So, like the hind and fawn, I can walk in my own paradise And
for their crunched bracken can repair my crumbled days.
But I move not with these night sails;
My fence is with the crouched fawn
And I'll go no further than the windows of this room;
The flowers against that window-sill

I lave dropped their flame into the tides of dew
And beyond their blinded facets I can hear your shepherd
song, Your oaten tragedies against the leaded window Shake
their midget thunder,
The lit and empty cave of night
Taps with the drumbeat of so many cares.
The rain rods and the mailed cold
Hang above summer and impend its doom,
So your wronged pastorals are near their venging.
Night, that soft plain easy to the tread,
Lies half untravelled at the window-ledge,
We will wander down its hedges, down the maze of doubts.
Not stirring from the couch but abroad among those glades
While this chamber-idyll, breathing from the night scents,
Drones its folded honeys and its shut wings of flowers.
Here, in this hived loneliness,
My ghost, and other ghosts, will shred the silken skein
Unwrapping worn mysteries;
We can breathe our own passions and rehearse our changes
From this arsenal of feeling,
The antlered distances, dead trees,
Lie leafless in the mist for us,
Where, beneath our own suns, we can dip them in deep
summers And argue in those fickle shades,
Or walk in winter's open vaults Between those chattering,
swayed bones While we time our mutations to the season's
clock Not fearing the arranged, sharp hours.
Now came the bell, the very voice of Time,
Blowing heart-stillness into this chamber of live memory, The
very airs were leaden in their stillness, then,
As the cold midnight sill, in all its stone so dead,
For there leaned against the window, looking in,
The goat-god, dark as any charcoal stack,
To whom I beckoned from the dark, dead room
But he stood in the wreathed window
And would not climb upon the sill.
Time, stand still,
Tie fast your wheel,
Roll not, bum not,
While I move
Through chimes of midday
Into the flat noon
Past twelve waterfalls that never mix
Into the wood of cherry-trees;
Where the whole evening into the blue night,
Lies like a garden
That is hedged with gathering chimes of the increasing hours;
So night, my chamber-idyll, turns to noon among the cherry-trees, 
And I talk at the ladder-foot
Where the wreathed climbers go.
O, stay with me, goat-foot, where the grass is high,
It makes a sweet meadow for your hoofs to tread,
While cherries, lively coals of fire,
But only burning to our eyes,
Hang near us, or are handed from the ladder-tower.
Like this,
Soothing grass will hush the animal in you,
And cherries, that are man's delight,
You can feed your mortal soul upon.
Stay with me and talk to me!
But the goat-god never spoke, he never risked his immortality;
Often is it so in chamber-idylls, and in idle dreams.
Where we speak and are not answered,
Or hear the voice of poetry and say no word ourselves;
Yet he stood at my side among the orchard boughs,
And we lived an hour -- an age -- in this world beyond my
window.
Where is the mortal in this earth that is so infinite,
That moves with me, boundless, and builds before my eyes,

That is prodigal, or bitter, that will give me shores of amber,
Or sharp rocks, the fangs of sea:
Will they die, the changing shadows of this chamber-idyll?
For death, where once was life, is not the same as death unborn!
Back from that shore among these orchard-trees
I moved among my changes, at the goat-god's side,
But kept these dreams among the boughs and never left them.
We lived, all that noon, deep in the cherry shade Moving each
ladder as the climber tired To change the harvester upon its
rungs And the goat-god took his turn with them,
But yet he never spoke to me
And only for the cherries did he move his lips.
My mood was broken when he left my side,
I woke in this room again and heard the flowers
Blown by night-wind and shaken at the window,
And I waited for my dream to heal, for its broken ends to join.
Then Midas, the miser, took me back with him,
And we lived, in an instant, where that noon was left Gilding
the ladder-foot at each gold tree,
Where he spared no wealth of his
And the climbers, like Hylas and like Ganymede,
Seemed stolen into heaven.
Their wreathed legs, against this cloud of fire,
Stood strong upon the ladders that we moved with them And
they threw the sprigs of flame to us and climbed yet further,
Fighting at the cherry heart.
And now to the edges of this magic wood
We came from that slaughter to the last tree's fate,
Where it leaned above a red wall,
The finite, the horizon, to this ghost of Midas,
For he and the goat-god only walked the noon-day wood And
never could come out of it, for fear I should awake.
His gold against my broken sleep did Midas spend And for his
last breath of safety made the goat-god climb,
Hazarding this heaven with his treacherous hoofs,
But they held to the ladder-rung, and he climbed high Till he
saw, beyond the wall, ripe honeycombs of corn Cut deep by
the reaper who now rested in some shade.
Then he cried, the goat-god, like a bear for honey,
And stretched out a hand towards the harvest,
Shaking the tree-stem like a bear his bars;
But the corn never came to him, his greedy hand Reaching for
that mirage, fell upon a sunny apricot.
Midas, the miser and the spendthrift, wept,
His men, on their ladders, let the cherries fall
And dropped from the heavens where they worked and sang
To weep with Midas.
These battles broke the dream, and now my chamber-idyll
Fades from noon into the night hours,
I wait through these watches with neither apricot nor cherry,
And only little flowers and little wind I hear.
O, may these change into a wood for Midas,
May we work at the cherry-trees in a noon that never ends;
My stone-sill, chilly with the moon's cold rays,
Darkens with a ghost again, the play begins.

DOCTOR DONNE AND GARGANTUA
CANTO THE THIRD
They slept -- the two of them -- with music lulled
Through a day-long night of dreaming
To its measures moved;
For Donne and Gargantua in their diverse spheres
Walked, each in his paradise, to the slur and stress of tunes.
Such green shades, fast as any ragtime built,
Formed like bricks into the shapes they loved:
To a wood of white statues, or a game of chance
Hazarded through trees.
The tides of light drifting with the dwindling hours
Climbed upon their window-sills, gave boundaries of shadow;
Sheer as a precipice were the edges of that moonlight,
And, leaving it, you moved from life to death and were
forgotten. Donne, in that mock life, stood at his window For
the galaxy within that mirror shown,
To number up their golden heads and tell the ripe about to fall:
He dreamt the quiet midnight and the opened casement
And the shivering, showering tumble when the glass moved
back,
Trembling in its leads.
Night, the noisy, silent night surrounded him like water:
The other sleeper
Dreamed in deeper measure with slow fancy, slow to form.
I pull them from their pleasures at a trumpet's sound.
Gargantua dressing.
Daylight, daylight, wedged within his window like a golden
cone Startled Gargantua with a din of brass Battering at his
eyelids;
He is in the window, at the source of light, stemming that quiet
current,
His memory still mixing in the masques and the lit night
Among remembered nymphs,
Among spangles paler than the fire of eyes
In imagined dalliance with those fine curved limbs Close to the
flower mouth.
He dresses now to please them, pranked about with plumes.
At his mirror, or the opened window:
Like smoke, proudly frozen smoke, those tufts of feathers
Framing his solar face of manly red,
His hair, thick as bear's fur, cropped for a shade,
With forehead of a bridge-pier's strength and bulk Made
formidable his emptiness.
The high comic mirrors laughed in their fullness of his ripened
shape Sprouting from their borders;
As a toad too heavy for the pool he's found Gargantua
flounders at that echo's mouth,
Overlapping on to land.
Wind its little madrigal, among the leaves now rattles at his
windows With soft fingers on the pane, or on the cold stone,
Beating out the harmonies for its sighing voice to cover;
All else is stirring, and the walls repeat
Their sounds of cloistered waking.
I was talking in the courtyard when he came below,
Heavy down the stairway through the murmuring arch
To the heaped and autumn bonfire leaves :
I was talking to the servants of their daily work,
Of how they must remember me and come to me with prayers.
Kneeling in the fleecy snow, or bowed before the sun's hot
doors Facing all the seasons to where those gates should show
Thrown open at the farmyard bugle:
They must work to my orders, bow which way I want,
Like the `left-right ` of the soldier that may never be `right-left` 
While the soldier must obey and never question as to
origins;
But Gargantua interrupted with a brutal coarse joke Dispersing
all their discipline. I slunk away.
The chapel bell, cold clapper through the frost's white light.
Called me away and I slunk to my own shrine,
To the feet of my statue in the morning mist.
I had come here weary of omnipotence
But stooping to discussion I had lost my power

At a challenge of Gargantua,
That form of smoke in leather armour of his own thick hide.
Other gods had come to earth,
Shown through lightning's breaking glass, or shell borne down
blue fields of sea,
But poor as a beggar did I watch these two competitors,
My Caesar and Pompey of these later shadows.
Think now,
If the cards of fate had pawned in other fields,
Had they mantled in dead shade the glittering hero of that
triumph How the trumpets could transmute his African, lone
death To dancing maidens, cymbals, bending airs of music,
To wind in high cornfields of the Nile's black land
When they grow their golden hair above that green falling
flood
And wind runs shaking out their purses of young seed,
This for the cymbals dashed and rattling to their deaths;
While the flowing paths of music are tracks among the corn,
Bridges and footfalls like his marks upon the sea,
Moving with the clouds, pitched tents, or struck and moving.
But Caesar and Pompey were dead pawns to me
Moving down fields for ever fallow, never bearing,
And I cared not which killed the other
Snatching his mock-life of me ;
While Donne and Gargantua, each in his sphere,
Walks without me and has the populace to work upon,
Each can win, each can lose, each can break his paper life,
Tugging at that kite through the thick and fiery winds,
Foul breath of crowds, battle pantings, whimpered words of
fate. Till the string break.
When their souls survive but must forage for themselves,
For I cannot care for something that can never die.
Consider the changes since I held my hand!
How the world of metaphysics, the changing glass of dreams,
Hides in the gold-blowing wood that trembles at our windows
Where Donne schemes safe within the casement harbour.
Close to those waters.
The spoils of Africa,
Sand from green rivers sieved and fired for gold
Must load his horns of plenty:
It will lie like honey but far heavier,
For sand, bitter sand, and never honey fills the hour-glass
Dropping in rhythm to the hours of honeyed light
That are matched in their cells of sun with this falling sad grain
of sea ; Skins striped with sunfire,
And monkeys, comic mirrors of our own bald shapes,
Are borne at the chariot wheel
With black prisoners, dead coals of hate.
Pompey is an arrogant high hollow fateful rider In noisy
triumph to the trumpet's mouth Doomed to a clown's death,
laughing into old age, Never pricked by Brutus in the statue's
shade.

In the still hours of the silent tides
When air is a smooth mirror
The shining wood of starlight has come nearer to us,
Through time, and through the leads of depth and height,
Thrown like the sailor's line from golden tree to window
Where he waits at that glass shore for the crow's foot alley,
quincunx, or lone trees of that fire-dropping balsam.
If he snares the wild wet meteor
He has conquered other worlds
With sword, gun, or fishing line, of air or glass,
So merciful his weapon.
His word will be delicate, full of tragic artifice,
Tricking the meaningless,
Heaping intention where there is no purpose.
I can grant his fantasies,
The lit nights, bare days, dead bones of trees.

Cold shores, foamless,
Where Leviathan looms, rock like, and spouts among the
surges At wind's edge, close to shore;
I can load all seasons on the trees,
Green leaves, spring tide of foam,
And the autumn mist and bonfire
Under boughs of red apples, red as winter sun;
There is spiked, frost-telling hardness
And the wild wet raspberry, like Donne's meteor in gold
thicket.
Grows over-ripe, bird-pecked, near to the bonfire smoke.
Gargantua loves no bitterness, no sad distinction in the dying
months Dwindling to winter,
His airs must be full-throated with thick boughs of shade,
Loud in voices;
If he finds the mandrake
He will not pare and thin away, refine what's there already,
Choosing from the flow of months what suits his fancy
But grow all into one galaxy, one live long summer,
With daytime of hot lolling hours and night close-roofed with
stars. The sensual world will heave with breath for him As the
lobster cranking, shell-jointed in its tank Which you watch,
and are afraid to eat.
Branches in that glaucous air will move and sigh Deep in their
green amours, while the young tides of sea Surge and faint
back against the hot, naked shores:
But my vision cracked and fell from me.
Gargantua, while the mist spent, had gathered them together,
His tocsin I'd mistaken for a call to prayer,
But I dared not creep close enough and never heard him from
the porch For he spoke in low undertones.
By the rules of my own hazard while I played at man Mortal
sight and hearing were my bounds of power,
So I crept down the shadows and escaped the crowd.
Donne worked alone and never spoke at public meetings,
He had dressed in silence, eaten breakfast in his room,
And schemed at his table in an arsenal of papers.
For the viols and lutes of music, the weapons of that war of
words He works with rhyme, that ancient shuddering cymbal,
Loud rattled, or struck with hammer blow, once sounding;
His desk with Turkey rug deep-dressed,
His goose-quill by the ink's black pool,
The weapons on that parchment field.
Here is his day's battleground, by night's slow tides
He watches the heavens,
Looking among those wrecked worlds at the drifting weed of
stars Till his meteor falls.
Midday, the sloped watershed of light,
Parts the morning, the long faunal hours
Stay talking in the woods, for now one hears
Clang of sword and trumpet from the hard leaves Hitting out,
loud glittering, in the sharp falling light Spilled like thrown
water.
Cool pleasures call the Knights and Nuns together;
They ride in glass chariots by the flowing river Racing its
wrecked galleons of boughs and leaves That run for the rocks
upon tides of melted snow.
Some are caught among the shallows,
The Knights and Ladies in the chariots See this ghost of
Actaeon, an tier-headed, out of the sands Who waits in bitter
sadness seeking pity for his fate To melt cruel Winter's heart
of snow,
But the river, brimming with that winter harvest,
Plays by his body, has no pity for him,
It mocks his longing with cold path of tides That flow by his
wasted limbs,
These waters, like the nymphs would, lean their flanks And
curve, water soft, their snowy breasts to him,
But they pass and never stay, they have no love for him. That
frail ghost is a parable, a myth to them,
Called forth by the hunter's horn, full of subtle meaning, And
the Knights stretch the parallel, they strain its meshes, Fitting
their own lives to that worn web of feeling.

There are other interludes in the moon's hot light;
They are hitting white spheres in a green court of grass
Across a net's entanglement of hope or pain,
Hazarding their chances,
If the ball comes back again, swift message in soft answer,
Or whether at that hedge of hopes it falls and faints;
Music, flower-like, hangs at every window Mingling with its
sisters,
A hundred voices and a hundred lutes throb in the wall's hot
shade, The fountains throw bright falling dice of water That
changes long before you sec your fate,
Though fate is but an ebb or flow in tides of love
And the throw of each fortune but a shadow on these waters,
A shadow on the thinnest glass, a ghost in shallow mirrors.
Gargantua had promised them immortal life
And deathless beauty from their elixir,
This alchemy of dank leaves, low growing, never noticed;
The peasants, too near to life and earth, were not persuaded,
But the Knights and the Ladies took this surety for their
pleasures. They looked for the mandrake with Gargantua in the
herb-garden. Talking by those warm red walls close hung with
netted fruit In the hot night when Gargantua deceived them
Dallying with Melulla.
Yet this discovery had no shame for him,
Since they loved him for his human faults
He could work out his plans with no danger of exposure,
Sharing their frailties, and loved the more for them.
These two shadow worlds, the real and metaphysical,
Both shadows, since neither true nor false can be exact,
Are here for you to choose between;
You have two salvations, one quieter than the other,
Two deities and their rest homes;
Stabbed Caesar and dead Pompey are ghosts in hollow porches

Inviting you to enter,
They guard the brothel doors but not to stop you entering.
Now my two present heroes have alternatives more pleasant,
One is a paradise that you enter through a herb-garden,
For the other you must watch the air, like a sailor the changing
winds, Posted many a night at casement harbours by those
lead-locked pools Waiting for the meteor's golden mine to
drop And open that fine quarry of philosopher's stone.
One hero makes speeches and the other works in silence,
At a seeming disadvantage, for but few people know him;
Yet his work is riskless if you think of Gargantua,
Fallen, and hated more because he once was loved.
If Gargantua is tempted and may fall, now and then,
Such are the Gods, and only Christians can deny this:
Those vaults of religion where blind faith is born,
The poet's Indian Caucasus of lovely rock-deep vales,
Have tempted the divinely born before they grew to sanctity;
There does Thelema rise without the hand of man Falling to
Thebaid with the sharp green summer,
Till then, what raptures in the Indian evening,
So fiery the tempting that resistance is the greater sin;
(To deny yourself is pleasure where there is no pain,)
The rocks that have been thrones of fire come cool for our
climbing And this Indian heaven is our changeling for
Thelema,
For the walls of the Abbey we have hedges of closed fire by
night That will open in the morning sun to flowers, ember
mirrors Rayed and bearded like the sun they mock;
If Donne climbed with us in these spires of rock He'd think
that his meteor had passed this way,
Flying low above the windy hills,
And roofing for one moment with wings of gold The rocks and
leaves its plumes have touched.
Here is where temptation springs, like water from a cold
stone,
It breaks of a sudden from the bitter heart of rock;
Boughs turn to limbs to help the leaves' green hair
And warm breasts of love grow where the flower should be:

For trumpet to this pleasant war the Indian bird
Croons, dove-soft, its double note of warning,
But when the Indian summer burns too deep
With hoarse, sweet voice, sharp rind like lime,
That bird will sing this Southern clime
In that far-off valley among green, steep,
Rookery trees by the towers of Thelema
While it mocks with its Cuckoo Cuckoo
Our bells that each have but one theme;
Though ringing them together their hundred tongues
Will thrash and beat the air,
And when those iron words are dead
The cuckoo in its green cloud, in the young plumes of spring,
Croons, sweet and hoarse, and dares an answer from us.
It rides on another's nest down winds of an alien spring
Changing the torrid Indian sun
For this light among green branches where the airs are young,
This heaven of temptation, this court of deep and restless
thoughts, Echoes with that mockery of the Indian air,
Soft trumpet blown to break the knots of love,
Or does this double note, two halves of prayer,
Cry the two shadow worlds, the real and metaphysical?
We left Gargantua at the chapel door speaking to the servants,
Though he uses other methods with the Knights and Ladies,
Not rhetoric, but the wiles of conversation,
He talks in deep gardens or at the courts of hazard,
Those risks and chances give him parables,
Spicing his argument;
This summer day the spheres of hazard
Are talismans of snow, let us suppose,
Pressed by hands that kept their souls engraved
On this logic water that the eye can mark,
They are thrown on their risks above the webs of love Whether
they are snared, or keep their ounce of winter In a little last of
rime against the green hours of summer:
This would be his parable of quick surrender,
Or long siege of constancy
To conquest turned.
Such is the sensual world, of melting, or enduring,
And I hold it next that other one, sharp war of the spirit,
Fighting for nothing, with no token won, or lost,
Out of endless battles, in deserts, and heaped cold The very
fuel of winter.
You can choose between these hazards, or salvations;
Stabbed Caesar and dead Pompey are ghosts in hollow porches
Inviting you to enter,
They guard the brothel doors but not to stop you entering.
In long winter when dark day is night,
Since the roofs of Thelema on a slant for snow
Are steep in that pale thatch,
The caves of slant moonlight dipped into the day,
We will march our heraldry from courts of hazard
And melt it a red fire, at a hecatomb of fir-cones,
That bum their quills of resin for our flames of legend;
There docs Gargantua on this crater-edge of firelight Build the
embers into towers and caves,
For this is his winter-war in wiles of talk,
While my other hero in these goose-plumed days
Plots at his table with quill-pen and paper.
The courts with feather-litter of the cold are filled
And the dead woods hear no hunting-horn
But drop, now and then, their burdens in one footfall;
These evening legends to dark pits of ghosts Grow in
Gargantua's parallels to the cold,
For he matches the winter with its raps on door and window
By iron-mail on the winding stair
And a white horse at barred windows that no hand dare open.
Here do I leave them for a night of noises,
My Tarzan, my ape-man whom I'll make again,
And the old philosopher in his cell of books;


We will leave them at the fireside till we break into their
legends And knock the red logs into a light to show their faces.
Yes! stay there!
Except we move you, up dark stairways,
For your night in the black pit of ghosts,
Till I wake you with a fanfare and you take your places Just
where we leave you at red towers and caves.


CANONS OF GIANT ART
Three Torsos

THE FARNESE HERCULES Heroes out of music
born
March their glittering shades down myrtle alleys in the poet's
wood Breaking the rhymed lights of reason.
For these three lines of preface
The black cape of magic hides my head and hands
Till I fix the staring camera eye:
`Keep that position, gentlemen! keep it and look pleasant!
The chattering agora, sudden camp of stalls,
Reaches to the statue's feet, to the platform for these stylites,
Who stand all day and night in rain's blue cage,
Fed with this water and the yellow bread of sun.
`It will make a very pretty water-colour.
Look how still he keeps. Tie your sandal to his ankle.
He was one among a whole white wood of statues
In the market-place along a road of triumph,
Then moved with pulleys at the trumpet's sound
To the Baths of Caracalla where the rhymed lights of poetry
Bore the new Prometheus from the womb of that dead
music. Hercules lay broken in the heaped, dried dust;
His legs took twenty long years to find
So bitter had his fall been. To the roll of thunder
Fell he, or the red Goth's hand?
Now his dwelling is a dark museum,
A dingy hotel dining room with no food ever served,
We'll forget that dreary future for his laboured past;
We will take him from the Thermae to his native land,
To the poplars and the caverns, to the hills of wild thyme.
Their limestone worn by rain's slow tide In spires and
guttering pinnacles;
No foot climbs to those towers but the bearded goat Cropping
the cold herb among the cactus swords, While winds of
prophecy in hollow caves foment To break from the
shepherd's lips, or speak by signs.
The agora, that platform for the quack and the actor,
For anyone swollen with the wind of talk,
Grew to a parliament of all the muses,
Till poetry and music, spawn of words, were born
And gods walked in the harvest, or among the grapes,
To choose a mirror of themselves in men;
They tired of immortal love and stole into the harvest
Hidden in wind's raiment, or at a tower of stone
Fell in a gold shower like sun with rain;
Such were the loves of gods who schemed in green barley
To snare the bowed reapers, or grape-gatherers on their
ladders.
This talking, ceaseless talking, like a rookery in the elm's
green roofs, Cawed and chattered whilst they built with twigs,
Though here in the agora the twigs were beams of marble And
they worked like the rooks do by tradition and proportion;
Their temples were a shepherd's hut magnified With ninepin
pillars and a tilted roof
Walling in this open way a dark inner mystery.
Since the gods made a mirror of themselves in men,
Sculpture, a shepherd's craft -- they carve in their waste-hours -- 
Copied like a camera this echoed immortality
And matched the mortal limbs of man against the deathless
gods.
Then, the forests of white statues grew
And the gods and men among them only differed in their
emblems ; The athlete oiled and slippery for wrestling Stands
by a god who treads the windy hills,

You could see this naked athlete in the stadium
And hear that god speaking in the groves of philosophy, His
limbs gleaming white out of sharp edges of the myrtles In the
fainting sunset when the lengthened shades are lifted. Then
were those arsenals of legend stored,
The hills of thyme were the stepping-stones to heaven And the
wind spake in oracles from sacred woods.
There did these ghosts stalk on stilt-like pattens
And thunder the heroic verse through mouths of brass.
In the dun twilight other shadows creep,
While this first giant art is born out of rolling high speeches;
Other shadows creep between the syllables In chequers so that
light or shade can hide them,
And Harlequin's wand becomes a thyrsus in the grape-harvest.

The normal, the simple life was in the young, fresh air
With the shepherds sitting by their sticks of fire
Or the fisherman living by his nets of fortune
Throwing for fast silver in that tideless sea.
It was the Golden Age before the Age of Gold began;
How snow-soft were those legends falling every year
In a winter of white blossoms through the speaking trees,
For they formed, like snow docs, to the shapes they loved,
To a sliding gentle poetry that is made of nothing,
Though it lives by the body of its melted beauty,
In a sharp, deep river, or at a fountain in the rock.
The tumbrils slowly creaking under pyramids of grapes
That ran down their life-blood on these boards and on the oxen
Took home the husbandmen,
Maddened by these fumes and by the pulsing sun;
This shadow-life of drunkenness, this mocking of the fire of
health, Gave birth with its mirror to a world of ghosts,
The theatre and its actors began at that stained trestle And
masks to keep the mirror truth and hide the living difference
Were born in that blue autumn. The mock children Of fine
shepherds and their bearded goats were shown;
And the goat-god in dark rocks once seen.
Where the tumbril waited in the pine-tree shade They made a
trodden dancing-floor,
This grew into a half-moon of rough-hewn stone, To the
theatre of mock death and laughter;

Thus was the camera eye tricked and cheated,
For these ghosts with their masks and stilts were outside life.
Was ever death so cold as this, or love so fiery?
Those armoured gods, those women calm as oxen,
In the cold heroic mazes, in sacred families of tragedy,
Move to their destiny. The beardless ephebus
Comes through the flower-thickets, stands naked in full light of
day,
For he was the vehicle of their strange loves;
So to those legends we have giant stilted shades,
Ox-eyed women, and young naked limbs
That will tear on a rose-bush, or stain with the grape.
He Was born, our Hercules, in the yard of a stone-mason,
Dragged in his matrix by a team of oxen
And tilted with a lever to that ground thick with statues,
There he stands rough and clumsy like a boy on his first school
day Waiting for the chisel and the cold eye to study him.
Tie your sandal to his ankle; tease him like a bear;
Though who can the gipsy be who leads him, ring in nose,
By green hedges, his rough bed at night,
To the crowded, noisy agora,
To that theatre where the gipsy's horn
Sounds among the shadows that the statues throw?
Twelve labours, twelve slow tours on foot,
Has he who made the beetle walk laid out before him, Though
the labours of Hercules are tasks he can't avoid,


He is carried there by instinct like dogs to a dog fight. Instinct,
little voice, scarce seen, scarce felt,
Like the Indian on his elephant who guides it with a whisper
And can ride in a castle on that patient wave-back Through
green waters of the Indian bright boughs;
So, turned gipsy to our Hercules We will walk in the dew-deep
orchard Tasting apples of Hesperides.
Tie your sandal to his ankle! He will be your winged Mercury
To run before you. Won't he move? Won't he stir?
He is dank, cold, and dewy like the mushrooms of the night
Spawned in summer showers from goatskins of the rain;
He leans on his truncheon like a great policeman.
Glycon was his sculptor, and Lysippus before him
Had planned this demi-god leaning weary on his club;
Lysippus of Sicyon with his fifteen hundred shapes of stone
Who wrought his white nightmares like the sculptors of
Carrara From the salt-white quarries; -- 
While Glycon had the Romans for his Yankee patrons.
At least there was never such a gladiator : -- 
Or there'd be no audience in the Roman theatre;
He'd eat them up like paper!
No hero on wars of love in the wood's green tent
Ever heard the nightingales, bright stars to such an armour;
Had he lulled, my Hercules, below these lights That sang in
wan air
Before the moon in green tree-windows,
The glitter, while he slept, that should have touched his steel,
Would lie on no armour but his heaped rings of muscle, Rocks
deep-hidden in a sea of smooth skin.
He should be the sentinel on cyclopaean walls Guarding a
megalithic rock-hewn town
And moved to ram's-horn trumpet, blown
At the tomb-mouth lintel of that city-gate;
He is watching the flocks of sheep, dropped petals from the
clouds That move with shadow stilts along the hills' green
sides,
Or he guards the hayricks, honeystacks of grass,
That are pitched like a shepherd's hut with high, sloped roof
And yet are combs of honey that are cut for the cattle,
For they store all the yellow light that fed the grass And hold
sun and rain within their golden straws.
These villages of giant stone spread like a fashion
From mouth to mouth of shepherds
As by beacons on high, lonely hills;
Temples like giant hearthstones are built on the bare plains
And they save up their captives for the sacrifice of fire
When they bum a wicker tower of them above the stones.
That was a Golden Age for Hercules,
On wrestling ground, or at rough bed of leaves,
In fleecy nights of winter
Wrapped in woven wool as white as they,
When breath turns to smoke.
See him throw stones to keep the rooks off the barley!
They start quite low and rise on a parabola,
They blossom at their zenith, shut their wings into a meteor,
And fall like an anchor out of the clouds among the rooks.
See him run to turn the drove of horses!
He can blow in a corner of the barley
And bend that sunny hair against the wind,
So the reaper with his sickle cuts two sheaves for one;
Those horses that he turned and headed
Gallop in front of Hercules like a drum shower of the rain
Falling on loud leaves and the thatched hair of houses.
Hercules as husbandman is in the grapes,
He pulls the blue bunches from their roof of leaves
To fill the wicker baskets that the women hold

And they spill them into a pyramid in a space between the
vines ; It towers like a summer wave full of the sun,
Could this be still and frozen for a word to break;
Then into that deep sea of sun and summer rain He wades and
treads until its fire is loosed:
The rocks and hollow hills echo with his laughter,
Rocks that are the cold bed for goat-foot gods,
And caves, old mirrors for their sighs and loves.
The kneeling, fainting cherry trees,
So deep their green sails and their mouths of fire
That they burn like a galleon to the water-line,
Kiss with red lips his hands
That feel among the apple-trees
To their branches heavy with those sweets of rain.
Who knows what voices rang among the boughs
When limbs, so light they were like wind between the leaves,
Climbed from cool water,
And the orchard, one green tree of birds,
Sang from every window in its sunny leaves?
And Joined the Irish bullies on loud Broadway;
He could part the streams of traffic with a white-gloved hand
And snare the gunmen in their stolen motor;
Glycon and Lysippus would be sad to see him With his fugal
muscles in neat armour of blue cloth.
Away with him! Roll him to the drab museum,
To the stone companionship of other shades:
Let there be a banquet of the gods
On tired air through tangled, cobweb windows!
He lives again in thin shade of the olive-trees
At a cold fountain in the rocks
Watering his oxen;
From the orchard walled with river stones
Apples of sweet rain hang forth
While kneeling, fainting cherry trees bleed fire on to the grass
Let those green wings of the wind, sharp leaves,
Give him music for his feasting,
While fine nymphs of the river from their sighing brakes
Climb into the orchard, where great Hercules
Sleeps by sweet rain boughs and by cherry mouths of fire.
Cunning or big muscle were the ways to power.
To the Emperor lifted on a shield in the camp,
Till the Hebrew prophet and the fishermen; -- 
Then the men of destiny like old idols were thrown down And
the trumpets of triumph became horns at the tournament;
The walls of the castle like white cliffs of chalk
Stood like bulwarks to the green sea of time:
Long Gothic faces of the fair-haired warriors
Showed from beetle armour for those glitters down the myrtle
glade Those ancient heroes to long trees of birth Surrendered,
and the herald's horns.
Now there'd be no use for him, no work for Hercules, Unless
he turned policeman


THE HERMES
Tie your sandal to his ankle! He will be your winged
Mercury To run before you. Won't he move ? Won't he stir?

He is dank, cold, and dewy like the mushrooms of the night
Spawned in summer showers from goatskins of the rain;
He was found, this very morning, by the babbling Greeks
In the loam of Olympia that was once a beaten running track;

That hard crust has perished to a black crumb of rubbish.
Hold him lest he sink into the loam again!
Tie cloths to his ankles that he may not strain them
And wait till the Professor comes to make him stand!
Young Bacchus rides upon his shoulder, still,
And stretches for the grapes that Hermes holds to him,
Sweet milk for this baby in the vineyard's shade
While they rest from the aching, dusty plain
Safe-hidden from the throbbing tower of heat above them
That builds and dwindles with the hours of day.
We will walk through these green shadows to the nursling and
his guard
While Hermes holds the soft bank sleeping from his journey,
There we'll find him on his side, grass-printed,
And pressed still nearer to those blades by Bacchus Who
stands with little foot upon that god-like neck Pulling down a
tendril whose coiled springy fronds Leap back, dragging
anchor, through deep air like water,
Though this green liana he would make his ladder To the blue
grape-breasts below wide leaves of shade.
Dumb creatures of the summer fields
Work their little hazards while Hermes lies asleep :
Striped bees are busy at their market-stalls
And rabbits, half as old as Bacchus, play in light;
Its tawny partisans they try to capture
But at the very nibble edge these lift and rally,
Slide from warm soft ear to rabbit bob-tail just to puzzle
And swing their tawny tassels to the powerless paws
For rabbit hand to tarry. Next Bacchus sees
A domed house, yet no Greek built domes,
Creep slow to him, rising at the grasses' tufts,
Then sink like a boat between two crests of waves,
This tortoise of wet ditches on his way from pool to pool
Dragged his domed house past sleeping Hermes and young
Bacchus And stopped near that baby hand to feed among the
wind-flowers, Eating rain and honey from those sun-born
shapes of wind,
Then passed and was forgotten.
That shell, had they but known it, with cut reeds and cords of
gut
Was made to give them music, but the sleeping god
Dawdled in the dwindling shade and Bacchus to that black pit
fell Of dreamless sleep, till the slant sun
Poured at eye level through the tufted grass
And woke them with warm hand:
Hermes stretched and tore his sleep asunder,
Lifted Bacchus, and stooping through the leaves, walked on.
This mortal lifted to the gods by beauty
With no trappings of bright armour to his naked body
We will march by his shoulders from the tourist's eye,
We'll move him from the vineyard to all the earth there was
for him, To islands of one meadow, where the goats upon the
next hill Crop their cold pasture with a strait of sea between,
And the shepherd in the cave-mouth
Shouts through that trumpet to the alien hill in face of him
And is answered like an oracle from lips of rock.
The mainland with sweet hills of herbs
Breathes thyme into the summer gales
And blows ever sweeter while the bees stay to plunder
Shutting its myriad honey-hearts with falling sun ;
Bent valleys like a serpent's tail wind into the hills
And grow more sacred with the deeper rocks above them
Till these very valleys are a mouthpiece of the gods,
In lonely syllables of water dropping
That speak like war-drums by their intervals
And are turned to direful warning;


The gods have planted speech in all the ways of men, Their
path through the cornfield is alive with sound, With running
rumours through that golden host Who stoop, now this, now
that way, for the word, While groves of trees, on sacred brows
of hills,
Speak in simpler words than these.
Their speech is poetry falling from green leaves,
The casual tongues to such immortal talk,
That on this steep hill, half in sky,
Listen and tally to these words of wind
With summer in their boughs, or gentle rain, for peace;
And to the loves they see upon soft shelves of snow,
Bedded in gales that blow the clouds along,
They break their whispers while the leaves lie still
And the warm throat of the nightingale
Fires the dead daylight to a deeper night of love;
In the ebb of darkness the Dodonian oaks
Tremble to that dying song, while a loud horn shakes the
thicket And the ghosts of war rattle at black windows,
The leaves roll like drums, marching armies shake the tree's
green tent, Though such are but rumours in the rushing dawn;
And now shrill fanfares from the bams are blown
Till the satyrs from their night of work climb into the rocks to
sleep.
And the woods to common prophecy descend,
Of harvests, of famine, and of births to come.
So to these portents, for a sacred speech,
Was poetry born within that haunted grove,
Turning dim voices of the rocks and trees
To a living tongue of prophecy, while beauty came,
Like the river on the rocks, like wind in the boughs,
Shaping those messages from gods to men.
This was the first poetry, once shaken from the trees, And
heard in cavern, or from river-bed,

It lay in all the paths of life
Trapping the unwary into discontent;
It turned the mirror's pool into a bed of silver
More treacherous than night upon the sleeper's face,
At full moon, the mimic feminine to day's full strength Which
draws the sleeper's senses with that theatre guile;
It rode with wind into the asphodels
Nodding those dwellers in the fields with sleep,
Long before the night had drawn their sweetness from them
And left them flowers of parchment in a desert of strewn rocks
; It roused the clang of war and left the eagle plumes
Ruffled and dank from many months of rain,
The trumpets dumb and muted for the din of battle
And armour that had glittered was a cold cloak of rust Rubbing
the tired body with that mockery of blood;
This art of soft words that has no substance of its own,
No body of hewn stone, no painter's clays, no pipes of music,
Could hide such falls for all the forms it lifted Though its way
climbed higher if you found the rungs Living by soft speech
that fed your audience with honey;
Never did bear-pit want such sweets for taming,
Yet the dark wine of heroes from the hemlock's pod Brought
death no sooner, and was not so bitter.
It was death, unless you lived upon the bread of words,
Not trusting golden wreaths, or the drachmae of the dreaded
mines, Living, like Hermes, on the statued air ;
There did the triumphs pass, the trumpets on cold marble rang,
Soon dying on cold flanks of stone, shivered on that bitter
snow, Such limbs, safe beds of love for death,
Live the whole night and the dawn finds them awake.
Come, now, join these feasting shades
Who feed on empty air and have the air for roof and bed to
them.
See if that pale bread is not sweet to eat
And keeps you from hunger more than bread of men;
Tell us, cold Hermes, of the wine you drink!

Can any fire kindle through your chill, dried veins?
You ran with messages down terraced air
And now you stand motionless with lidded eyes of stone;
You are dead as old poetry with the same sleepy death,
Turning while your bones last,
Like a sleeper in long trance out of life but not yet stiff in
death, As lively as those pages that the breath blows over.
Bacchus has left you for the cliffs of India,
For the shores of high green below the bastioned mountains,
He is hunting through the tall trees, or coming down the passes
:
Do you remember the hot hours in the vineyard
When you slept, he played, and the tortoise passed you by,
Who was Time marching for yet further Indies?
But you slept, too certain of your pace to worry,
Stood up, stretched, and tore your sleep asunder
Lifting the nursling who could not catch the tortoise
And was, then, little stronger than the wind-flowers
Who raise their gentle heads and have but strength to grow.
You carried him, suckling at the grape's blue breasts,
Through the holy wood and up the hill of clouds,
From that day of green boughs, into that night of mist,
While those lips of prophecy sped you with clear words And
you walked into the white cloud with their whispers,
Heard at your back like footsteps in dry leaves.
Now you cannot pass from us, for all your death,
And I'll hold you to what once was life
With wine and bread of air,
That ghostly communion where words are born to poetry.
We'll shake the summer trees and hear those water-tongues
above us Babbling in images, the sliding soul of wit,
We'll hear the loves of Hermes, and his mortal tasks,
Sent as a messenger from gods to men ;
Where he works his own hazards on their duty bound,
And if he falls in a shower of gold at some high tower
Will lie in little mirrors for her feet to tread,
Walking in the garden when the great god has gone, Which
pools to his own image he expressly forms
And walks in the flowers at her side by this.
These caves of quicksilver that answer to his shadow Shut
their caverns in the sun's great heat,
They ebb like the tides and never start their flow again But
carry off these prisoners
And lock them through the leaves' green day
In a cell that never opens ;
There Hermes, like Narcissus, can his image see
And look upon himself in ceaseless prison laid,
But turned into a heaven with the ghost he snared Who keeps
perpetual day for him And dies not, for there is no dawn.
To fade like this into the flowers you tread And lie in a cell of
leaves for ever as a shadow This is more lasting than the fruit
that dies Wrinkled into old age when the nursing light Looses
the stem and lets the ripe fruit fall.
That was a pleasant couch, a bed of quicksilver,
Not like the black loam where you lay
On that modem morning when light struck your lids again,
Blind so long through your black night of misery.
What false dawn, for one who'd known no dawns,
Picking day and night like chequers for his pleasures ;
Both past and future were two boxes for your hands,
Where you dipped and found a summer,
Or rode with wind into the asphodels!
Your body, used to day again and rubbed with its honey, Lasts
as our prisoner, our shadow in the mirror's pool; Come tell us
of that bright shape
Through sword-gleams of the myrtles ;
Or, since you're but an image, and not the god himself, 87

Walk with us in the groves of philosophy,
Let us hear their poetry, not the lispings of the sacred trees :
How you ran, with oil and honey rubbed,
For a crown of green leaves,
How poetry was written to your wind and speed
And the sculptor carved your body as an echo of the gods,
As though the real Hermes he had snared a while,
Catching him with fine nets, in webs that could not break,
Until the finished image had no need of its model
And the airy shape leaped into the wind and left this shell of it,
This ghost of a ghost, this old, old chrysalis,
Which we found in black earth as though it waited for rebirth
This is the third Hermes, two removes from life,
For first there is the god and then the model for his image,
Three deaths, two of stone and one of clay, we find And only
know this cold shape, the mockery of life.
Your statue cannot help us, cannot blow the heavy pages,
And now the sacred woods are dumb,
The river-gods are silent, rocky caves
And brakes of bowing reeds, speak not.


Now your shell is with us and your statued death
Will last long ages, your thin crust of stone,
So young in lineament, is older than the oldest trees
Without their renewal by young tides of spring ;
We will stoop among the vines again
And change this death to sleep,
Like that, you are not different, you need not move,
And Bacchus, too young to speak, lies safe against your
shoulder. Here comes that cupola, that dome of music,
Riding on the long grass like a house with oars,
And see the horny tortoise, old boatman, at his flat prow
Working in the wind and not afraid of its rough violence! He
stays at the anemones to provision at their blue shores And
leaves them eaten empty for his voyage to come :
His music is not born yet, the lutes that his shell would form



Are dumb and have no life in them ;
He leaves his blue harbour of sweet rain and honey
On a safe voyage to Hermes, deep in stone, dreamless sleep,
But Bacchus, wide-awake, is not old enough to stop him;
He stretches out his hand, but it will not reach and will not
hold. And the tortoise rows past him and is lost to sight.
Hermes yawns, waking, and tears his sleep asunder,
Picks up Bacchus and walks into the green trees,
Soon they are lost in the night of mist,
While Bacchus still suckles at the blue breasts of grapes.
